0,0,0,1,5,I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.
1,1,1,2,1,"Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts...the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted. Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as ""Jumbo""."
2,2,2,3,4,"This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch."
3,3,3,4,2,If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.  The flavor is very medicinal.
4,4,4,5,5,"Great taffy at a great price.  There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy.  Delivery was very quick.  If your a taffy lover, this is a deal."
5,5,5,6,4,"I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat."
6,6,6,7,5,"This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.  Each candy was individually wrapped well.  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger's.  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it!"
7,7,7,8,5,This taffy is so good.  It is very soft and chewy.  The flavors are amazing.  I would definitely recommend you buying it.  Very satisfying!!
8,8,8,9,5,Right now I'm mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass. They love it. I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too
9,9,9,10,5,This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion. Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding.
10,10,10,11,5,"I don't know if it's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!  We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!  When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.<br /><br />Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.  Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.<br /><br />Thank you for the personal, incredible service!"
11,11,11,12,5,"One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didn't.  I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy, and the protein-rich, no by-product food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump.  The higher food sits going stale.  They both really go for this food.  And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week."
12,12,12,13,1,"My cats have been happily eating Felidae Platinum for more than two years. I just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different. They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food. I've noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past. Unfortunately, I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat."
13,13,13,14,4,good flavor! these came securely packed... they were fresh and delicious! i love these Twizzlers!
14,14,14,15,5,The Strawberry Twizzlers are my guilty pleasure - yummy. Six pounds will be around for a while with my son and I.
15,15,15,16,5,My daughter loves twizzlers and this shipment of six pounds really hit the spot. It's exactly what you would expect...six packages of strawberry twizzlers.
16,16,16,17,2,I love eating them and they are good for watching TV and looking at movies! It is not too sweet. I like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so I can take my time eating them.
17,17,17,18,5,I am very satisfied with my Twizzler purchase.  I shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them.  I will definitely be ordering more.
18,18,18,19,5,"Twizzlers, Strawberry my childhood favorite candy, made in Lancaster Pennsylvania by Y & S Candies, Inc. one of the oldest confectionery Firms in the United States, now a Subsidiary of the Hershey Company, the Company was established in 1845 as Young and Smylie, they also make Apple Licorice Twists, Green Color and Blue Raspberry Licorice Twists, I like them all<br /><br />I keep it in a dry cool place because is not recommended it to put it in the fridge. According to the Guinness Book of Records, the longest Licorice Twist ever made measured 1.200 Feet (370 M) and weighted 100 Pounds (45 Kg) and was made by Y & S Candies, Inc. This Record-Breaking Twist became a Guinness World Record on July 19, 1998. This Product is Kosher! Thank You"
19,19,19,20,5,Candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price.  I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me.
20,20,20,21,5,"My husband is a Twizzlers addict.  We've bought these many times from Amazon because we're government employees living overseas and can't get them in the country we are assigned to.  They've always been fresh and tasty, packed well and arrive in a timely manner."
21,21,21,22,5,"I bought these for my husband who is currently overseas. He loves these, and apparently his staff likes them also.<br />There are generous amounts of Twizzlers in each 16-ounce bag, and this was well worth the price. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM"">Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>"
22,22,22,23,5,I can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasn't dropped in all these years. Still a superb product you won't be disappointed with.
23,23,23,24,5,I love this candy.  After weight watchers I had to cut back but still have a craving for it.
24,24,24,25,5,"I have lived out of the US for over 7 yrs now, and I so miss my Twizzlers!!  When I go back to visit or someone visits me, I always stock up.  All I can say is YUM!<br />Sell these in Mexico and you will have a faithful buyer, more often than I'm able to buy them right now."

26,26,26,27,1,"The candy is just red , No flavor . Just  plan and chewy .  I would never buy them again"
27,27,27,28,4,I was so glad Amazon carried these batteries.  I have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size.  I need them for my garage door opener.<br />Great deal for the price.
28,28,28,29,5,"I got this for my Mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake, and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake - she's the one with the sweet tooth - they both LOVED these toffees, you would never guess that they're sugar-free and it's so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free!  i was so impressed that i've ordered some for myself (w dark chocolate) to take to the office so i'll eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweets.<br />These are just EXCELLENT!"
29,29,29,30,5,"I don't know if it's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!

30,30,30,31,5,"I have never been a huge coffee fan. However, my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato. No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products, too (as a usually non-coffee drinker!).<br />The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good Coffee/Latte/Cappuccino/etc in less than a minute (if water is heated up). I would recommend the Dolce Gusto to anyone. Too good for the price and I'am getting one myself! :)"
31,31,31,32,5,"This offer is a great price and a great taste, thanks Amazon for selling this product.<br /><br />Staral"
32,32,32,33,4,"McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey."
33,33,33,34,4,"This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand.  It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you.  Great on a cold morning when you don't have time to make McCann's Steel Cut Oats.  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too.  Plus they don't require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart."
34,34,34,35,5,"Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl. McCann's Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time. McCann's regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning. This is the best instant brand I've ever eaten, and a very close second to the non-instant variety.<br /><br />McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)"
35,35,35,36,4,"McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)<br /><br />I'm a fan of the McCann's steel-cut oats, so I thought I'd give the instant variety a try. I found it to be a hardy meal, not too sweet, and great for folks like me (post-bariatric surgery) who need food that is palatable, easily digestible, with fiber but won't make you bloat."
36,36,36,37,5,"For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store!  I love McCann's instant oatmeal - all flavors!!!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Abby"
37,37,37,38,5,"What else do you need to know? Oatmeal, instant (make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins;nuke for 90 seconds). More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something. It's still just oatmeal. Mmm, convenient!"
38,38,38,39,4,"I WAS VISITING MY FRIEND NATE THE OTHER MORNING FOR COFFEE , HE CAME OUT OF HIS STORAGE ROOM WITH ( A PACKET OF McCANNS INSTANT IRISH OATMEAL .) HE SUGGESTED THAT I TRY IT FOR MY OWN USE ,IN MY STASH . SOMETIMES NATE DOSE NOT GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO SAY NO , SO I ENDED UP TRYING THE APPLE AND CINN . FOUND IT TO BE VERY TASTEFULL WHEN MADE WITH WATER OR POWDERED MILK . IT GOES GOOD WITH O.J. AND COFFEE AND A SLICE OF TOAST AND YOUR READY TO TAKE ON THE WORLD...OR THE DAY AT LEAST..  JERRY REITH..."
39,39,39,40,5,"I ordered this for my wife as it was reccomended by our daughter.  She has this almost every morning and likes all flavors.  She's happy, I'm happy!!!<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QW8"">McCANN'S Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>"
40,40,40,41,5,"The variety packs taste great!<br /><br />I have them every morning. At $0.30 cents per meal, I don't understand why everyone on earth isn't buying this stuff up.<br /><br />Maple and brown sugar is terrific, followed by apples and cinnamon, followed by regular. You don't get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.<br /><br />I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!<br /><br />Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.<br /><br />Not sure why everyone on earth isn't this. Convenient, healthy, very quick, excellent quality, and extremely cheap..."
41,41,41,42,5,"McCann's makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur, whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour, to the sloth addled instant, which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes. It's all good, that's for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.<br />  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann's and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you're a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal."
42,42,42,43,5,I have McCann's Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost $3.00 per box.<br />It is a great product. Tastes great and very healthy
43,43,43,44,5,"McCann's Oatmeal is a good quality choice.  Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon, but we find that none of these are overly sugary.  For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes, this is excellent."
44,44,44,45,5,We really like the McCann's steel cut oats but find we don't cook it up too often.<br />This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient.<br />Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing.
45,45,45,46,3,"This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands, but it is somewhat mushy and doesn't have quite as much flavor either.  It didn't pass muster with my kids, so I probably won't buy it again."
46,46,46,47,5,Good oatmeal.  I like the apple cinnamon the best.  Though I wouldn't follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste.  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of.
47,47,47,48,3,"The flavors are good.  However, I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand - they are both mushy."
48,48,48,49,4,"I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor. The regular is fine with brown sugar added. The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK. This is a very quick, easy and satisfying breakfast and I'll order this brand again, but not the variety. I'll get all Maple and Brown Sugar."
49,49,49,50,3,This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores.  There is nothing healthy about it.  It is just carbs and sugars.  Save your money and get something that at least has some taste.
50,50,50,51,1,"This oatmeal is not good. Its mushy, soft, I don't like it. Quaker Oats is the way to go."
51,51,51,52,5,"Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller, and the advertising worked..lol,  I tried them, and shared them with 2 buddies, and we all loved them...  So im here to buy more, and noticed there were no reviews yet,...  well now there is.  They are Hot,  but not ""burn your mouth forever hot""  its a nice temp...  Perfect for us.."
52,52,52,53,4,"This wasn't in stock the last time I looked. I had to go to the Vermont Country Store in Weston to find it along with a jaw harp, Cranberry Horseradish Sauce, Fartless Black Bean Salsa, Apple Cider Jelly, Newton's Cradle Art in Motion and the staple Vermont Maple Syrup.<br /><br />Back to the Ass Kickin Peanuts. They are hot. They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms. It requires a beverage as advertised, a glass of very cold milk, and a box of Kleenex since it will make your nose run. They look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work. I suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence, especially my colleague Greg. I'm going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can, and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I return.<br /><br />The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed. It is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes.<br /><br />You'll go nuts over these Ass-Kickin' Peanuts.<br /><br />P.S. I'm not sharing the peanuts, not deliberately, and I'll probably give Greg the jaw harp for Christmas. He'll be so insulted."
53,53,53,54,3,we're used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy.  doubt very much habanero is used at all.  could take it up a notch or two.
54,54,54,55,4,"I roast at home with a stove-top popcorn popper (but I do it outside, of course). These beans (Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura) seem to be well-suited for this method. The first and second cracks are distinct, and I've roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time. The aroma is strong and persistent. The taste is smooth, velvety, yet lively."
55,55,55,56,5,"We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill (about 1/3 of the bag at a time).  The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too.  More importantly, the coffee is smooth; no bitter aftertaste.  On numerous occasions, we've had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much."
56,56,56,57,5,Deal was awesome!  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters.  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store's candy.
57,57,57,58,5,"It is chocolate, what can I say.  Great variety of everything our family loves.  With a family of six it goes fast here.  Perfect variety.  Kit Kat, Reeses, take five and more."
58,58,58,59,5,"Great product, nice combination of chocolates and perfect size!  The bags had plenty, and they were shipped promptly.  The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies!"
59,59,59,60,5,"Halloween is over but, I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share. The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many."
60,60,60,61,3,"Watch your prices with this.  While the assortment was good, and I did get this on a gold box purchase, the price for this was<br />$3-4 less at Target."
61,61,61,62,5,"This bag of candy online is pretty expensive, it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores, other than that, its a good combination of my favorite candy"
62,62,62,63,1,Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags!!
63,63,63,64,5,"I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a ""salty"" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough."
64,64,64,65,5,This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride.<br />I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor... no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation.<br />I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line.
65,65,65,66,5,This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides. Pop 1 into each water bottle and you're set. Flavor is fine and goes down easy.
66,66,66,67,5,"For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.<br /><br />Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat.  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The ""zero carb"" sports drinks didn't help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!<br /><br />I've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.<br /><br />These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work....."
67,67,67,68,2,"I purchased the Mango flavor, and to me it doesn't take like Mango at all.  There is no hint of sweetness, and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice.  I've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so I'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I've tried.  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I've tasted.  It's not terrible, but it's bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take."
68,68,68,69,3,"If you're impulsive like me, then $6 is ok. Don't get me wrong, the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints. But in retrospect, the price is a little ridiculous (esp. when you add on the shipping)."
69,69,69,70,5,this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds! my fault
70,70,70,71,5,"These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/lb. These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I'm concerned. I'm probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin' things. Consumed!"
71,71,71,72,5,"Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I'm lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious!"
72,72,72,73,5,"I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting. It arrived fresh and intact. Very good size. I froze half for later use. I am a pastry lover and these were the best I've ever tasted. The pastry was soft, the jam was really good and the taste was great. They were gone in no time. My guests were really impressed."
73,73,73,74,1,"Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!"
74,74,74,75,2,It is okay.  I would not go out of my way to buy it again
75,75,75,76,1,No tea flavor at all. Just whole brunch of artifial flavors. It is not returnable. I wasted 20+ bucks.
76,76,76,77,5,"These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix.  Unfortunately, they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate.  I left them in my pantry for a few days, and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey.  I through them in the fridge and I've been breaking off hunks ever since.  They taste good to me, but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again.  I won't order them online again, but if I see them in a store I would pick them up."
77,77,77,78,5,These taste really good. I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture. I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer. There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items. Order in cold weather and buy enough to last!!!
78,78,78,79,3,"The taste was great, but the berries had melted.  May order again in winter. If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor."
79,79,79,80,5,"i know i cannot make tea this good.  granted, i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet.  it tastes crisp."
80,80,80,81,5,This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat.  My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl.  I'm 30 now and I love it!
81,81,81,82,4,"Great gift for all ages! I purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much, they kept them and would not eat them."
82,82,82,83,5,"I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured ""food"" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great."
83,83,83,84,3,"While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food, for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice. I have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help. The duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly, but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again. I like Natural Balance for the quality ingredients."
84,84,84,85,3,"Awesome dog food. However, when given to my ""Boston"", who has severe reactions to some food ingredients; his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night, scratching. As soon as I changed to a different formula, the scratching stopped. So glad Natural Balance has other choices. I guess you have to try each, until you find what's best for your pet."
85,85,85,86,5,"We have three dogs and all of them love this food!  We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him, no more hot spots or tummy problems.<br />I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping."
86,86,86,87,5,"My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food. She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has. After we got the test back, we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand. So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this! She still has her environmental triggers, but I am happy she can finally eat something I know won't cause her pain."
87,87,87,88,5,My shepherd/collie mix has IBS.  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food.  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it.  I will always buy it from Amazon...it's $10 cheaper and free shipping!
88,88,88,89,5,Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell. She has awful food allergy's and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didn't have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to. She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice.. she seems to like that better. We started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon) too and she loves it. If your dog has allergy's or stomach issue.. or if you want your dog to eat better food-- this is it! You will see a difference in your pet.
89,89,89,90,5,"Great food! I love the idea of one food for all ages & breeds. Ît's a real convenience as well as a really good product.  My 3 dogs eat less, have almost no gas, their poop is regular and a perfect consistency, what else can a mom ask for!!"
90,90,90,91,5,I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food. I have switched them to a different food (due to price) a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance.
91,91,91,92,5,"This is great dog food, my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him."
92,92,92,93,5,This food is great - all ages dogs.  I have a 3 year old and a puppy.  They are both so soft and hardly ever get sick.  The food is good especially when you have Amazon Prime shipping  :)
93,93,93,94,5,"My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs I've ever met.  After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance.  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.  While I have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it."
94,94,94,95,5,This is the same food we get at pet store. But it's delivered to my door! And for the same price or slightly less.
95,95,95,96,5,I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs.
96,96,96,97,5,"My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food. He's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full. On the normal dog foods, he'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day. When you take this into account, you're actually getting more ""bang for your buck"" with the natural dog foods since you don't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods... and a healthier, happier dog, to boot! Add in the fact that you can get free, 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime... I'm sold!!"
97,97,97,98,5,Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods. The cheap 'you can buy it anywhere' food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets.  This food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food.<br />This message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved.
98,98,98,99,5,"My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3.  The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him (Iams Lamb and Rice) and onto a new kind.  This was the second one we tried, and it has been working ever since.  It's for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food (like chicken or beef)."
99,99,99,100,1,"I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it.  He wouldn't eat it, and when he did, it gave him terrible diarrhea.  We will not be buying this again.  It's also super expensive."
100,100,100,101,5,"The mouth says, ""How do I love thee, let me count the ways...""<br />If you like apple products a must have item.  The only draw back, shipping cost.  These are very heavy."
101,101,101,102,4,"Arrived slightly thawed. My parents wouldn't accept it. However, the company was very helpful and issued a full refund."
102,102,102,103,4,"The crust on these tarts are perfect.  My husband loves these, but I'm not so crazy about them.  They are just too sour/tart for my taste.  I'll eat the crust and hubby takes my filling.  My kids think they're great, so maybe it's just me."
103,103,103,104,5,"These are absolutely scrumptuous!  My husband and I both love them, however, as another customer put it, they are expensive to ship!  The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are!"
104,104,104,105,5,What a nice alternative to an apple pie. Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing. Easy to prepare. I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed.
105,105,105,106,5,I like Creme Brulee. I loved that these were so easy. Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil. They look amazing and taste great. My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes. I will be ordering more!
106,106,106,107,3,not what I was expecting in terms of the company's reputation for excellent home delivery products
107,107,107,108,5,"I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite. Hence, when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out.  These are even better than the ones from the Amish market. They are fantastic, and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom. I'm going to order the six pack and I'm a household of one. They wont go to waste!"
108,108,108,109,5,"I love asparagus.  Up until very recently, I had never had pickled asparagus.  Oh my goodness, when a friend introduced me to this exact brand, I couldn't believe how great stuff tasted.  I loved it so much I bought the six pack.  I've got 2 jars left.  Gonna need more!!"
109,109,109,110,5,"I'm presently on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods. I wanted things that were tasty, non-fat and low in calories. I came home with about a dozen items. That's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Well, I've always liked asparagus anyway and I've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good! It's the best I can recall. There's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in  the bottom of the jar which I'm looking forward to eating. I can't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says ""only 60 calories per jar!"" Now this is my idea of a good diet food!<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
110,110,110,111,2,"I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix.  I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried, but was diappointed in this specific one."
111,111,111,112,5,I have been drinking this tea for a long time now.  I used to have to purchase it at a doctor's office because it wasn't available elsewhere.  I'm so glad that I can buy it now from Amazon.com.  I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee.  Wonderful taste.
112,112,112,113,5,"I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now.  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).<br /><br />Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays ""NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS"" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays ""CAFFENE FREE"".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it."
113,113,113,114,5,"this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted... it's clean, bright, fresh...<br /><br />great delivery...again quality... just try it..."
114,114,114,115,5,"I love, love this green tea.  It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually don't get as many boxes as I did with this merchant.  I will definitely order from this seller again!! Thanks!!  I depend on my green tea fix everyday!"
115,115,115,116,5,I love this tea. It helps curb my eating during the day. My Mom and I have given it all friends to try.
116,116,116,117,5,"I'm Italian and I lived in Italy for years. I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso. I couldn't find them anywhere here in the Bay area, so it's great to have them again."
117,117,117,118,5,"In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy. This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or mid-day snack. They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then. They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy. It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon!<br /><br />Note: it is great to open a bag, smell the contents, pour a glass of milk, then dip the Macines in the milk. Great routine and treat for kids!"
118,118,118,119,5,"I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it."
119,119,119,120,5,"I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his ""spunk"" so I decided it was time to start buying him ""real"" cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and I'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals!"
120,120,120,121,5,"I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select."
121,121,121,122,5,This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food.
122,122,122,123,5,"I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me."
123,123,123,124,5,"Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters."
124,124,124,125,5,"My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!"
125,125,125,126,5,"One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef. This formula is one of the few she can eat, and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet. Both of my kitties are very active, have soft shiny fur, and neither are fat. Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth, also."
126,126,126,127,5,Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book!
127,127,127,128,4,"I've been a fan of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time. If you enjoy spice, and love ramen, you'll love this product. Too bad it's way too expensive here on Amazon. It's only $3.36 per 12 at my Walmart."
128,128,128,129,5,"I've been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid, and I've never found a better flavor than Hot & Spicy Chicken!  It isn't hot at all to a chilihead like me, but it sure is good!"
129,129,129,130,3,"I LOVE spicy ramen, but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesn't go away for like 3 hours! Not sure if that is healthy or not .... and you can buy this at Walmart for $0.28, way cheaper than Amazon."
130,130,130,131,5,"Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal, finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in."
131,131,131,132,2,"I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor.  I don't find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn."
132,132,132,133,5,I really loved the spicy flavor these had.  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite.  If you aren't used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough.
133,133,133,134,5,"Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup, which is half the price of my local grocery stores, plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors. These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you can't escape for a real meal. This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale."
134,134,134,135,5,i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon
135,135,135,136,4,"I love this flavor of ramen! I don't eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison. For the convenience of having it delivered to my home (I have prime, so I get it in two days and don't have to pay for the shipping), the price on amazon isn't bad at all, but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store."
136,136,136,137,5,"The BEST investment I've ever made for ginger. It's unbelievable! It's fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but it's perfect with the sugar - calms it down.  It's very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  I'll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :)"
137,137,137,138,5,Delicious. I cannot get Australian ginger where I live. This compares favorably to Australian Ginger I've purchased in other cities. Now I can enjoy it without traveling.
138,138,138,139,5,"I keep trying other brands.... cheaper brands. Stupid me! This ginger IS soooo worth the money. Tender, moist and never a let down."
139,139,139,140,5,"My son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement, Until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and I automatically ordered it for him. I was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried. What a surprise! He has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this Ginger each morning. He can now eat anything and actually enjoy it. This product was a God send for him. Thank you all for it!"
140,140,140,141,4,I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on.  Because it's bite size it's easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick. My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping.
141,141,141,142,4,Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand.<br />If you can get these for $2 to $2.50 a package with free s/h it's a good deal.<br />The black and cherry have good taste; but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there
142,142,142,143,5,"I love these.........very tasty!!!!!!!!!!!  Infact, I think I am addicted to them.<br />Buying them in packs of 6 bags - is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag.  Savings are about a $1.00 a bag.  I use subscribe and save on these and several other product.  I love subscribe and save!!!!!!!!!!!"
143,143,143,144,5,"If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children, then be sure to try these!  They're soft, easy to chew, and they don't get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc. We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack! Great item, great price too, highly recommend!"
144,144,144,145,3,"I might be mistaken, but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size.  If they did do that, it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal, having so many pieces after all.  The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience.  As it is, you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size;  it is not the same."
145,145,145,146,5,"Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it's mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it's a steal!"
146,146,146,147,2,"The SALSA smelled delicious, as I think it probably was - but, unfortunately, the person, at AMAZON, that is a packer (there is probably several) had very little ""stuffing"" to work with, especially on the bottoms.  Therefore, the bottoms were broken on all three bottles. As I reached for my computer; I was told NO RETURNS (cause it's a food item).  I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag; and I found ""none"" on their NEW FACE LIFT.  THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT...THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES!  LIKE: I BUY A LOT OF ""STUFF"" AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES.  NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGS<br />ESPECIALLY SALSA - IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT.  NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER (FED EX) IS CAREFUL, IT'S GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE.  ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER!  BARBARA L. S."
147,147,147,148,5,This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack. The other two that come with it are not worth your money.
148,148,148,149,3,These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon. They're kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product. But my finace really loves them so that's where the three stars come from.
149,149,149,150,5,"This is the best cornmeal. I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding. Also fried some oysters with this meal, it gave them a great texture and flovor."
150,150,150,151,5,"This is a fabulous marinade!  I love to use it for chicken, either baked in the oven OR on the grill.  This has enough flavor & flair, I've even used it for dinner parties, only to receive rave reviews from my guests!! DEFINITELY worth the price! Super cheap and super easy! Love it!"
151,151,151,152,5,Works with chicken fish beef or pork. Fast easy and makes it taste excellent. Plus buying in bulk is more than 50% off from box stores
152,152,152,153,4,Got this for my brother who is on Jorge Cruise diet and decided to try one for myself.  It actually tastes pretty good.
153,153,153,154,1,"These singles sell for $2.50 - $3.36 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles. I'm not sure why Amazon is selling it for $9.99 for a box of 24 singles.  Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but truly this is not a good buy."
154,154,154,155,5,AWESOME!!! such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you. I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful.
155,155,155,156,5,"I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here. This jello is wonderful! Evidently it's only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall, I couldn't find it anywhere in town. This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam! Great made as regular Jello too. Yummy!"
156,156,156,157,5,What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use.  This box should last our family the year no problem.  Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will.
157,157,157,158,5,"Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket.  We love it. Shakes well, no clumping and flows freely."
158,158,158,159,5,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:26 Mins<br /><br /></span>The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product. The tuna, tomato combination is delicious. This is one of the many items I re-order on Amazon every month or so.<br />edit: added a short video, so you see what this combination looks like.<br /><br />I was wearing one of those headlamps, but I didn't do a good job focusing on the tuna.<br />I should film it over, but it doesn't look like many people view this product anyway."
159,159,159,160,5,I've never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches; Starkist and Chicken of the Sea. I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning.
160,160,160,161,5,"these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion - make a great on the go snack, and really satisfying with the tomato"
161,161,161,162,3,"I have always purchased Star-Kist tuna but thought I would try this brand for a change of pace. The taste of the tuna was not pleasant, too much basil and other spices for me."
162,162,162,163,4,"I'm not familiar with the Safcol brand but being a tuna addict, gave this a shot. The tuna tastes like it's good quality but I found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland. It's better than something plain but it didn't pack the punch I was hoping for. It's still a great option for a low calorie, low fat meal."
163,163,163,164,5,"I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there. Excellent quality, and no need to 'dress it up'.<br /><br />I put it the micro on about 20% power for 1 minute and Shazam!<br /><br />I believe a little heating brings out the flavor."
164,164,164,165,1,Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come. There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack. You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor.
165,165,165,166,5,"I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it! I haven't made anything with it yet, just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent! It's dark, syrupy, sour, and a little sweet. A dab of this and I forget about dessert. It's just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Yum!! I'm going to try making fesenjan next :-)"
166,166,166,167,5,"Used this in Moroccan recipes, as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water.  Wonderful, wonderful stuff!"
167,167,167,168,1,"I don't know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere, but they were so old that they wouldn't cook.  I had to throw half of them out, because the skins were damaged, a clear sign of dried beans past their prime.  I can't even return these or ask for a refund, because food is not returnable.  Will find a different brand to use.  For now, I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away."
168,168,168,169,1,"Besides being smaller than runts, they look the same and have the same consistency.  Unfortunately, they taste nothing like banana runts...nor do they even taste good.  Yucky stuff.  Trying to return with vendor."
169,169,169,170,3,"The item over all was fine, but the Banana Heads are not just like Banana Runts they are alot smaller. Also when I received the item, the packaging was not great. The Banana Heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope."
170,170,170,171,5,"I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme! They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy. I purchased 5#. If you want more than 25 small bags, I would purchase a larger bag."
171,171,171,172,5,"I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine. I love this stuff in milk.<br />It's much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk. I am French and live in the US,<br />and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity. Savora is another hidden gem you can bring<br />back. Check it out."
172,172,172,173,5,"I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious!  I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that, I love this product!"
173,173,173,174,5,"I couldn't wait to try the 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs, creamy sour cream, Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel. This 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only $18.95. Now, I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes, but, let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really ""takes the cake"" with size, price, quality and taste.<br />The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition. It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldn't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you've got the perfect breakfast treat!"
174,174,174,175,4,I used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 5-6 years ago. This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going. It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong. The stronger it is the less you use as well. The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost. I thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad. This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like.
175,175,175,176,5,"One of the best lemon juice that I have tried. I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product. When the season for fresh lemos is out, this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments.<br /><br />I will continue buying it."
176,176,176,177,5,This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year-round. It has a powerful flavor and you don't need much of it to zest up a dish. I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day.<br /><br />I will buy this product again and again.
177,177,177,178,5,"Fast delivery and good product. This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it's really handy to have around to add to sauces, dressings, etc. Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it, nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with."
178,178,178,179,4,"This is not as good as the Frozen Lemon juice, but it is good. It has a slightly odd flavor, perhaps from a preservative. Sure wish I could order the frozen juice!"
179,179,179,180,4,"Couldn't believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was. Seriously, drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime. If you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended.<br /><br />I feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation. After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place.<br /><br />Love this stuff."
180,180,180,181,4,I bought these at Grocery Outlet here in the Seattle Tacoma are for $4.00 a case of tweleve not paying $38.00 Yes 3 for a dollar. I like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price.
181,181,181,182,5,"This is an great product. The taste is great, and it works exactly as described. Superb natural sleep aid. AMAZING!"
182,182,182,183,3,"WE have been looking for ""natural"" ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule. Yes, we'd probably be better served taking a yoga class, but this is a good second choice. This helps you fall asleep and stay asleep. I drank half the first night and that was plenty for me. After about 30 minutes, I was ready for bed! I woke up refreshed and with no sleepy-drug hangover, so that is a huge bonus.<br /><br />I gave the product 3 stars (instead of the 5 it deserves) as their packing job was marginal at best. The product arrived with 2 broken bottles, which at this price is a $6 loss! The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the small-bubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box. Big packing fail, but the product is awesome."
183,183,183,184,5,"We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic!  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldn't discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it."
184,184,184,185,5,This  is great stuff.  Made some really tasty banana bread.  Good quality and lowest price in town.
185,185,185,186,5,"We had trouble finding this locally - delivery was fast, no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores."
186,186,186,187,5,"This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something ""strawberry"" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively ""healthy"" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base."
187,187,187,188,5,"My Scotties were full of hot spots and when I used this within a week all the hot spots were gone. The smell is kinda strong, but not bad. It's tolerablel."
188,188,188,189,4,"I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants.  I didn't expect it to taste good, but it actually does!  I've only had it for a few days and for $5 its totally worth it.  My sisters all take ganocafe but now I'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee.  I will follow up on this product in a few weeks.  :)"
189,189,189,190,3,"The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright.  Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better - I bought this to try something other than these two, but I probably won't get this again.  There is just a slight ""vitaminy"" taste, but it's not overwhelming.  It's also a bit pricey for what you get."
190,190,190,191,5,"This coffee is great because it's all organic ingredients!  No pesticides to worry about, plus it tastes good, and you have the healing effects for ganoderma."
191,191,191,192,5,"Like the other people mentioned, this coffee has a great taste. I've tried different instant coffees before, but this one is one of the better ones. Another one of my favorites, if you want to try it out (though NOT organic), is 'Africafe pure instant coffee'"
192,192,192,193,5,"Tastes great, and gives me energy without the jitters. Love this product.<br />However, I do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch because the zip-lock ripped off and quit working after awhile. But the product is fantastic, just not crazy about the packaging."
193,193,193,194,5,These little guys are tasty and refreshing.<br /><br />I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath.  I eat 2 of these after lunch (because they are so small) and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem.<br /><br />They're sugar free (sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow) which is great and they're tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch.<br /><br />This is a good bulk value buy and I'd highly recommend the mints themselves.  Cheers!
194,194,194,195,4,"I like these better than the regular Altoids, but they're even more costly, so you'd better like them."
195,195,195,196,5,These little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great deal.There perfict for on the go.Fifty mints per tin is just the right amount to cary along.And there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugar.The price of twelve dollars was very resonable.Also there great for shareing.If you are looking for a mint try these ones.Youll be glad you did.
196,196,196,197,5,"Pros:<br />+packaging, shipping, price<br />+sold about a year before its expiration date (enough for me to eat/share 9 boxes)<br />+not too ""fresh"" like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form. it's a real mint!<br /><br />Cons: none!"
197,197,197,198,3,"Be careful not to eat too many of them in one day, as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a LAXATIVE!!! LOLOLOL!!!"
198,198,198,199,5,These mints are really strong and have a great taste. They are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse.
199,199,199,200,5,This is a huge supply of them. I'm still working on these and have plenty to spare. Much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 7-11 every time you want a mint.
200,200,200,201,2,"Even with small containers, they don't fill them up.  These little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a rip-off. Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares?  Or how about the cereal ploy, they were filled at the factory but settled in transport.<br />Can manufacturers be honest in their dealings?"
201,201,201,202,5,"I love, and use the empty containers for medicine/advil in my purse, desk, suitcase. Also line with felt to keep earrings. Perfect little size to disguise small valuables when traveling and LOVE the mints. Tiny and powerful without burning my mouth."
202,202,202,203,5,Received as shown. My mother in law likes these and Walgreens quit carrying them. It was great i could get them on Amazon.
203,203,203,204,4,"I keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to. Some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet. When I find someone who keeps coming back for more I just give them their own tin! One co-worker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes. Like I said, theyre a real hit. Since I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off a candy dish, this is a good alternative to have around and it's nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch! I gave the item 4 stars because they aren't as tasty as the sugar version of the mints  but what sugar free item is as good as it's full sugar counterpart?) and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove (although I totally get why they wrap it - it still doesn't make it easy to deal with)."
204,204,204,205,5,"The tiny Altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability. It's full, but compact.<br /><br />I haven't run out yet, and probably won't for a couple months, but I can't wait to buy it again."
205,205,205,206,5,"I loved these Wintergreen Altoid Smalls so much, I had to come write a review. The packaging is small for convenience, and the Altoids are smaller as well with a square shape, blue hue, and even more delicious taste in my opinion. I definitely prefer them over the regular-size Altoids and will continue purchasing them! Highly recommended!"
206,206,206,207,5,Fresh scent and taste. Easy to eat one tin in few hours. I use them as favors and everyone loved them.
207,207,207,208,5,"Hard to find the wintergreen smalls [sugar free] as stores only have the red smalls [peppermint --such a common flavor]. The wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious. Driving cross country, if someone cuts me off, I turn to my daughter with my hand out and say ""Wintergreen Me!"" She pulls one out, puts it in my hand, and all is right with the world."
208,208,208,209,1,"To me, these are nothing like the regular Altoids and are not breath mints. They are pleasant-tasting little candies in a cute convenient tin, and that's as far as it goes. The mintiness is just not strong, and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis. I'm not a dragon-breath person, but still, one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath. Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while - maybe 15 minutes. At this point, I think the Icebreakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints."
209,209,209,210,5,"we have fed our cats a lot of stuff. These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters. They loved the Purina. They loved the Nutro. They loved the Iams. They love whatever we feed them.<br /><br />This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change. Some made the litter super-stink.  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn't have to chew it to swallow it...<br /><br />This Felidae has done the trick. No problems to speak of. It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose. The cats love it. The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing. And here's the kicker:<br />After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved. Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food. We're now loyal Felidae consumers.<br /><br />Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies."
210,210,210,211,5,"I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it. She's an older cat, somewhat overweight, and had a grouchy temperament. I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which -- she ate the Felidae and left the old food! She's now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now, off the old food entirely, and she is a much sweeter, happier cat. I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested, or something. In any case, I am a happy purchaser of Felidae. I don't agree with the previous reviewer that cats don't like it. Clearly, mine does."
211,211,211,212,5,"We have three cats, the youngest is about eleven years old, another is fifteen and our oldest is, well ancient.  That is what the vet told us ten years ago.  The youngest is a blob.  When he lays down, he looks like a footstool. The other two are arthritic and skinny.<br /><br />Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs, I figured that we'd give it a try for our cats.  I'd had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems.<br /><br />Buster, the youngest, is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats.  However, the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really ""feeling better"" since we changed their food to Felidae.  Even Prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on Purina One, all she wanted to do was to sleep.<br /><br />I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, it'll be more effective.<br /><br />However, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life."
212,212,212,213,2,"Too much of a good thing? We worked this kibble in over time, slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junk-food brand until the bowl was all natural. By this time, the cats couldn't keep it in or down. What a mess. We've moved on."
213,213,213,214,1,"As with canidae, Felidae has also changed their formula.  Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get ""upset"" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.<br /><br />We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven't suffered one bit like our dogs have.<br /><br />Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.<br /><br />I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible!"
214,214,214,215,4,Don't buy just a few of these!  I order these by the case.  I can't even remember the first time I tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but I have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite.
215,215,215,216,5,I order these olives a lot. They are un-like any other olives out there. The subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses. One of my favorite appetizer treats for guests.
216,216,216,217,1,"Hey, the description says 360 grams - that is roughly 13 ounces at under $4.00 per can. No way - that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can."
217,217,217,218,3,"My husband and I are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us. It definitely makes you sweat a bit when you're eating it. It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I don't think I would buy it again due to the heat. We prefer the milder McCormick's brand of Fajita mix. I've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn't as spicy as this mix is.<br /><br />If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind. To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it. You take a plastic bag, a couple of tbs of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning, water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes. In the meantime, it says to stir fry your veggies (peppers and onion) but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I don't think it affected quality or taste. I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil.<br /><br />I have one more package of this to use and next time I'm going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more."
218,218,218,219,5,"A friend who'd been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago. Even took me over to the store and bought me a pound. At $7/lb. in a retail store or a little over $9 with shipping from an online merchant, I think it's great. I've been drinking Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Lapsang Souchong, Assam, etc. Most of them were over $30/lb. with shipping. Aside from the Lapsang Souchong, I think this is a great replacement for all the rest. Has everything I'm looking for in a strong, full-bodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring. My current favorite afternoon tea. Unless you're extremely jaded or a tea snob, you'll love it."
219,219,219,220,5,"I love strong, full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam, irish breakfast or early grey tea, but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging. So I have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasn't bitter at a more palatable price point, and this certainly fits the bill. And unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another, i.e. iced vs. hot, this tea is excellent in both forms. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesn't cost an arm and leg."
220,220,220,221,5,"I drink this tea plain (without sugar or milk), and it has a pleasant aroma.<br /><br />The price from Amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store.  One reviewer is right, I think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma.  So the label ""Imperial Blend"" kind of implied the herb.<br /><br />I am not exactly a black tea drinker, so this tea is a surprise, and affordable too.  I usually prefer White Chinese tea, like White Peony, but it is more expensive, and requires lower temperature water.  But this is black tea, and this aroma kind of remind me the 'softness' of white tea."
221,221,221,222,5,"I've tried a variety of Ahmad tea. Not because I particularly like this brand, but they are just easier to come across.  The Imperial blend, I believe, is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones I've tried. It's full body like a good cup of Assam, which by no means overpower the delightful, clean taste of Darjeerling, complete with a long lasting note of bergamot. I enjoy it best in the evening. It gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day.<br /><br />For those interested in the specifics: I use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug, let it steep in 208F water for 2-3 min, take the infuser out, and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication."
222,222,222,223,5,"I have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the Russian custom of preparing and drinking tea, and the Ahmad Imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced.  I buy the three-packs as needed from Amazon and go through them rapidly. My family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too, try one box of it and you will love it too."
223,223,223,224,5,This is an excellent tea.  One of the best I have ever had.  It is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar.
224,224,224,225,2,Herbal additives in this blend destroy real tea taste. It is only for people who like herbal taste. I don't.
225,225,225,226,4,"Makes a tasty, super easy meal, fast. BUT high in calories.<br /><br />The instructions say to saute the veggies first but I recommend cooking the chicken first. The chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess. I made it with snow peas and carrots only. I dont like the little corn.  Added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice.  It came out wonderful! Dinner on the table in less than 30mins."
226,226,226,227,5,"I think I have tried just about every Bloody Mary mixer on the market at one time or the other.  Most have too much sugar or worst, corn syrup.  This mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty. It does have a little kick. Enjoy."
227,227,227,228,5,"Might be a little spicy for some, but this stuff rocks. I use 1/2 and1/2 with V8 for a milder version , or the best is a Bloody Caesar!<br />Half mix ,half clamato!"
228,228,228,229,5,Took me one or two to get used to the pickle taste.  But now aim hooked and have to keep a bottle on hand
229,229,229,230,1,This candy is not as described. The middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described.<br />Looks and tastes like it's way past it's expiration date.<br />Would never reccommend this. Paid a good chunk of cash for nothing
230,230,230,231,5,"I started drinking the power slim tea when I was on the HCG diet to help curb cravings. Since I liked it so well, I tried some of the others and I am now hooked!  They are so satisfying that I drink them all the time.  The Energy gives you that extra pick-me-up in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day, no matter how long."
231,231,231,232,5,"I'm trying several of the Wu Yi teas. I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste. It also has a natural sweetness.<br /><br />The ingredients include Organic Wu-Li Cliff Oolong Tea (700 mg), Organic Black Tea (600 mg), Organic Green Tea Extract (100 mg), Proprietary blend (600 mg), plus some Ginseng (panax), Orange Peel, Lemon Grass, and Guarana. Other Ingredients: Natual Orange and Citrus flavors.<br /><br />My goal is to drink more tea and less coffee. I am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day. I'll be coming back to this one."
232,232,232,233,5,"i cannot live without this citron falksalt, it is wonderful on watermelon, fish, almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does.  just try it on red juicy watermelon, wonderful experience."
233,233,233,234,1,"Terrible! Artificial lemon taste, like Pledge Lemon Furniture Polish. Don't do this to yourself. Just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest."
234,234,234,235,5,"These things are huge! I love the way the crystals crunch, and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle. This lemony flavor is my favorite--it's good on almost everything. You'll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this."
235,235,235,236,2,"The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker - which is not bad, except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese taste.<br /><br />What was a HUGE disappointment? How misleading the packaging of the box is. The photo on the box (I bought these in store) makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads (expanding the length and width of the box). Wrong! The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2"" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads.<br /><br />What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers. Not ecofriendly at all.<br /><br />Would I buy these again? No - I feel ripped off. The other crackers (like Sesame Tarragon) give you a little<br />more bang for your buck and have more flavor."
236,236,236,237,5,"This is the ultimate puppy food.  The kibbles are great for small breeds.  High in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use.  Less waste results from the high quality ingredients.  I have been hunting, training, showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years, with multiple National Champions.  I have been highly satisfied with Eukanuba's quality and the results I have obtained feeding their foods.  My recent purchases are with WAG, through AMAZON.com.  Their prices are the best I have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock."
237,237,237,238,4,"The recommendation when we bought our puppies (lhasa/bichon mix and lhasa/poodle mix) was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned. This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.<br /><br />Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.<br /><br />When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.<br /><br />Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better."
238,238,238,239,5,"A very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />In the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.<br /><br />I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away. The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb (much cheaper than I can find locally).<br /><br />This is a great tasting tea, which I am happy to recommend."
239,239,239,240,5,"Fresh,a great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories. They taste just like chocolate pudding."
240,240,240,241,5,"If you like the Ceylon tea variety, you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea.<br /><br />I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) and very surprised at the negative review from 2009 because in the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.<br /><br />The current deal for the pack of 4 is very good (cheaper than I can find locally).<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />NOTE: This listing's description is confusing. Each packet of tea weighs 500 grams, which equals 1.1 pounds or 17.6 ounces."
241,241,241,242,5,"I've been enjoying this tea for years.  This tea is good mornings, afternoons or evenings.  My local store went out of buisiness....Thanks Amazon!  I use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot."
242,242,242,243,5,"Hi, I have to have black tea everyday. I have done it in the past 25 years and it's a habit of mine. Ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and I highly recommend it if you like black tea. I think this is going to remain my favorite for the next 100 years or so :)"
243,243,243,244,4,I have tried it out despite the other review and I found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either Russian or Italian groceries.
244,244,244,245,4,Ahmad Tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea. Great flavor with no lingering aftertaste.
245,245,245,246,2,"I've been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years, usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas, where many Middle-Eastern stores carry loose Ahmad teas, usually at $5-7 for a pound box.  I've always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea, with enough aroma and taste, and beautiful reddish color, perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own, but a decent base for mixes.<br />This tea, however, is nothing of the sort. Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell, and the brewed tea is weak, flat and tasteless.  Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore. So, you get a lot of tea for the money, but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags, they are not that much worse."
246,246,246,247,5,"I love love love this deal - it's way fun to pick from so many! Teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees. The other outfits that assemble samplers are boring - they do the choosing, and from a much narrower range. The sellers here are very nice, also, and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method (it's easy). If you want great packaging, forget it - they ship fast, and the kups are just tossed loose in a box. Who cares?"
247,247,247,248,5,"Once you've tried some random sampler packs (and now are overloaded with decafs,extra bolds, or teas), this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want.  Received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what I ordered.  This was my second order and I'll be ordering this item again."
248,248,248,249,5,good products and fast shipping equals a happy me. a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavors...a few i cant find anywhere else so def worth the price
249,249,249,250,5,If used on a daily basis you will keep your gums healty and between your teeth clean and free of plack.
250,250,250,251,5,"WOW!  This product is very impressive. I bought the 8oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging, price and shipping.  The powder dissolves instantly.  Even in water!  I've just been mixing a 1/4 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great!, but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next. This product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries, especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away.  I think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well.  I'm excited to add more of the SuperFoods to my diet in this fast and easy way. I definitely will being trying the other flavors soon."
251,251,251,252,3,The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry. Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme. Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem.
252,252,252,253,1,"Five minutes in, one tentacle was bitten off, ball inside cracked in half. Not durable enough to be a dog toy. Disappointed :(. So is the dog :(."
253,253,253,254,4,I am chemical sensitive as well as sugar-free. I have been using this product for over a year. I use it maybe once a week at the most. I drink 1/2 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how I feel. IMO this doesn't replace my a.m. coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when I start to fade. Once in a while I drink a full bottle before a workout. I've been drinking Guayaki Yerba Mate teas for years. Compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there I highly recommend this. This product is clean and doesn't leave nasty chems behind in the body. Try it before you judge from a review - everyone's body reacts differently.
254,254,254,255,1,"I felt energized within five minutes, but it lasted for about 45 minutes. I paid $3.99 for this drink. I could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money."
255,255,255,256,2,"Yes, it's probably healthier than 5-Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if you're looking to avoid a caffeine overload, this is still not for you. Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.<br /><br />Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!"
256,256,256,257,5,"These Nature Valley Nut Lovers Variety Pack was perfect. Although I wasn't sure about the peanut butter bar, it was excellent. I loved the Roasted Almond, Roasted Pecan and the Peanut Butter.<br /><br />I will definately buy from this seller again. Quick shipping and very fresh."
257,257,257,258,1,"I so wish I would have read this review before purchasing TWO gallons of this oil for my health issues. It reeks like a chemical rubber smell. This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid. When I called to report the situation to the company, Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab. Unbelievable. Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund, including shipping. The product is faulty. Period. I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership."
258,258,258,259,2,"This product has a strong after-taste of Crayola crayons!<br /><br />I am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes.  Upon opening the plastic container, the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room, and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in it.<br /><br />I suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as I have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchased.<br /><br />To date, my favorite coconut oil is distributed by Barleans.  The flavor is fantastic.  However, they do not supply a gallon-sized tub,and Dr. Mercola has the best product in that size category."
259,259,259,260,5,"Had this shipped to my sister who follows a gluten-free eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets. Also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs.  Stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking, too. Good product, good value."
260,260,260,261,5,"These are healthy and my mixed Llasa, Tibetan Terrier adores them. And they are healthy and his breath doesn't smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products. A great healthy product."
261,261,261,262,5,"A great healthy chew for my 9 wk old beagle, Rio. He loves the taste and it sure beats my arm."
262,262,262,263,5,"I really enjoy this product. I had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store. Once I found it I look no further, it's the only sugar I use.  Thanks so much."
263,263,263,264,3,"I have used and liked Sugar in the Raw for many years, after being introduced to it in a Starbucks. My most recent purchase, however, was disappointing. The sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 1/4th of the regular size. Having large crystals was something I always really liked about Sugar in the Raw. It enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes. I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar. They have had many complaints of a similar nature. This, they claimed, also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away with their newer crop. The representative said that the new-crop sugar will have a 6-10 digit date code (without ANY spaces) that ends with a ""1"" and no letters. The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar. (My recent bad-purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a ""51A""). Bottom line: their current product is not much better than much cheaper products. When they get a better crop, I'll go back to purchasing Sugar in the Raw."

265,265,265,266,5,Love this sugar.  I also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar. Recommend!
266,266,266,267,5,Product is exactly as advertised.  What a savings!  At least half the retail price. Easy to store because of the individual packaging.
267,267,267,268,1,"I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice."
268,268,268,269,4,"It's just sugar in the raw, it's flavor profile is much better then white sugar and it's suppose to be better for you or something. I just wish the bags were resealable."
269,269,269,270,4,"This is a delicious sugar. It has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma. But the granules are quite big, however -- bigger than plain refined sugar. This makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together. But if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it, or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it, it is a great product. It would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer."
270,270,270,271,4,"I only use raw sugar, it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good. Will buy again."
271,271,271,272,5,"This sugar is very good.  Use this in your coffee, cereal, etc for a week and you'll never go back to white sugar, white sugar will taste terrible.  Plus from what I've read, this Raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our diets.<br /><br />The product was delivered fast and well-packaged.  My only complaint is the price.  I wish I could find Raw sugar cheaper.  I would be happy to buy in bulk, but this is the cheapest I have found."
272,272,272,273,3,"I thought this was a great buy, but as noted by Scott D., the molasses content was not up to par.  I loved the higher molasses content ""Sugar in the Raw"".  Unfortunately what I purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and I have twelve 24 ounce bags.  I guess I'll watch for the next crop."
273,273,273,274,5,I really love this sugar and price-wise it's much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else.
274,274,274,275,5,"Love this sugar. It tastes so much better and isn't as overly sweet tasting as ""regular"" sugar. We've used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good. The price that Amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff."
275,275,275,276,4,"Can't say anything bad about Sugar in the Raw.  I like it better than the other ""natural"" sugars. Better consistency and - I know it doesn't matter - but better color. Unfortunately, one of the ""natural"" paper bags got torn a bit in the box.  It didn't look like the box was damaged so I can't tell how it happened, but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when I opened it.  Not sure what the solution is and I'd order it again, but if it happens again, I'd switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag."
276,276,276,277,5,Great service! Items arrived faster than expected. Very efficient! Will use this seller again. I highly recommend this seller! Thank you for the excellent service!
277,277,277,278,5,"Please ignore the one-star comments, if you check the bag the main ingredient IS in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower. With anything that is gluten free you have to add another ""binder"" which is where the corn flour comes in. For someone who has celiac disease and cannot have Sunchips, because they contain wheat (a key binder to any chip, cookie or cereal) this is an excellent product. My spouse and I buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious!"
278,278,278,279,5,Best flavor ever!  I'm addicted!  They are all good but these are by far the best.  I could live on these!  And there is no need for anymore to say....
279,279,279,280,5,"So many ""healthy"" products don't taste very good.  Or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill.  I've had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty.  I've served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them. It's also nice to have something gluten-free for friends who are borderline diabetic...but I would eat them anyway."
280,280,280,281,5,"I found these crisps at our local WalMart & figured I would give them a try. They were so yummy I may never go back to regular chips, not that I was a big chip fan anyway. The only problem is I can eat the entire bag in one sitting. I give these crisps a big thumbs up!"
281,281,281,282,5,This is one of the best tasting crisps I have ever eaten! I only buy it on special occassions because I know I'll eat the whole bag.
282,282,282,283,1,"I paid $1.79 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today. I bought them because brown rice is a ""good"" carb.  As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients.  The name is deceptive - these have ""Masa corn flour"" listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste.  I won't buy these again - I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste."
283,283,283,284,5,"I use the Rotel Mild and I LOVE this product so much--it saves me on a daily basis.  If you're trying to cook lower fat, healthier foods and in a HURRY, this stuff makes it so much easier.  Ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird ""tin can"" taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever?  For some reason this product doesn't have that.  It tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans, heat and eat.<br /><br />or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup.  I also make indian dishes with this, and spicey spaghetti sauce.  I also prefer this to most canned salsas, so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid off.<br /><br />None of my local grocery stores carry it at all, nor do they carry anything like it.  So I have to pay Amazon's inflated price to order this by the case.  I don't like that I'm paying a higher price, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the product."
284,284,284,285,5,the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores. i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for $1. dissapointing!
285,285,285,286,3,"howdy y'all,<br /><br />the actual product is VERY good - i'd rate the item a 4 on it's own. however, it's only ONE dollar at the local grocery and - @ twenty eight+ dollars per twelve pack - these are running almost two and a half dollars each.<br /><br />as i said, TOO EXPENSIVE. [*sigh ...*] i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local cost.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee"
286,286,286,287,3,"Nothing wrong with the product, but I sure had to mix it with *lots* of other ingredients to make it edible to me. (In Texas I was called a ""baby-mouth"" - not into very spicy-hot foods.)<br /><br />For comparison, I'm comfortable with Tostitos medium chunky salsa. 1 can of this milder Rotel, mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes, was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips. I used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though."
287,287,287,288,5,"This is a fantastic product, and I wish it was readily available in most stores. It's taste is not the greatest, but it's a 2.5 oz. shot, and it's gone in a second. It tastes, more or less, like a concentrated sweet tea. For the record, I've had 5 hour energy, and that tastes FAR worse. I will put up the taste for the results. It's got 150mg of caffeine, which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters. I can't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes, and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it. The sugar is at 9g, which isn't horrible. I used to drink 4 16oz. Red Bulls a day for the caffeine, and this gives me far better energy, and is much more subtle. My preference is black coffee, but I can't drink 8-12 cups a day anymore. Overall, Steaz does it right; real organic ingredients in moderate amounts, and they create big results."
288,288,288,289,5,"I have to get up really early to work out before work and I get super tired by the middle of the afternoon. I was drinking one 5 hour energy, usually extra strength, each day. It worked well, but gave me a jittery feeling, almost headachy but not quite. My husband got me to try this and I was skeptical, but for me it works as well if not better than the 5 hour energy and doesn't give me that jittery almost-headache feeling.<br /><br />I don't mind the taste--it reminds me of the inside of a fig newton (mmm). And the price is ok, on Amazon anyway. At my grocery store they were almost $3 each, yike!<br /><br />And it's organic--so I can feel good about it, right? It's all about me feeling good!"
289,289,289,290,5,I bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there. He takes one in the mornings and works hard all day. Good stuff!
290,290,290,291,3,"I am a energy junkie and I'm not sure if this works or not, but what I do know is that the taste is not the greatest. I do drink the steaz energy drink and I think I get the same results. I like this products because it is  more natural then the others."
291,291,291,292,5,"If you want an organic energy shot, your choices are this one from Steaz and the assorted flavors from Guayaki. Guayaki Yerba Mate is actually in the Steaz energy shot and energy drinks, and they both use Sambazon Acai, so there are some similarities in ingredients.<br /><br />Great energy burst for 4+ hours on a Steaz Energy Shot, and no withdrawals or headaches afterwards. Plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work. This will help me cut down on my iced coffees, which are not helping my calorie intake.<br /><br />Already ordering 12-packs on subscribe and save, 2 per month. Great value."
292,292,292,293,5,"I was looking for a natural energy shot that works, and I found it. Steaz energy shot is my favorite!<br /><br />I recently had gastric bypass surgery, so tons of sugar is a no-no. And I'm also allergic to Sucralose (Splenda) so most other energy drinks are out.<br /><br />I tried Bazi energy shots and they didn't work as well as Steaz, and definitely didn't taste as well. These have a taste that's almost like Coca-Cola--not bad at all.<br /><br />If you're looking for natural energy, give these a try."
293,293,293,294,5,"I had tried both of the Guayaki energy shots and I don't like the taste of either of them! This one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better. I like them cold for sure. My husband and I take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we don't have to make stops for coffee! Especially on the turnpikes where it's just way too expensive. It's worth the $[...] per shot. We normally split them. I'm really sensitive to caffeine, even the natural kind so I get a little weird if I drink the whole thing but that's the same for coffee too for me. My husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost. I would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there. You can feel good about putting this in your body! I'll be ordering again soon for sure =)"
294,294,294,295,3,"I purchased it because it was on sale. In terms of the energy it provides, it works, but the taste leaves something to be desired. I tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable."
295,295,295,296,5,"I've been feeling extremely tired around the late afternoon. As a software engineer, this is entirely unacceptable! So, I asked the nice lady at the counter of my local Whole Foods Market, for something that will give me that extra energy I need to get through the day.<br /><br />She excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle. Over three hours after drinking whatever that was, my brain is still working at unnatural speeds. To summarize my experiences: I believe this works.<br /><br />She did explain that I needed to drink plenty of water with it, which I personally feel helped the energy level. So if you're feeling tired during the day and hate coffee, give this a shot - preferably before you eat anything.<br /><br />Woot!"
296,296,296,297,4,"The energy shot truly does work! It had a terrible after-taste at first, but now that I know what to expect, I am getting used to it. I always have some water handy as a chaser...which helps! I am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy I need without all the chemicals found in other beverages. It's helped me kick my addiction to Diet Coke and other aspartame-laced caffeinated beverages. Yay!!!"
297,297,297,298,5,"I've tried 5-hour energy, red rain, NOS, and other energy shots.  This is my favorite in terms of taste and effect.  Plus, it's somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used.  Sometimes I wonder what I'm really putting into my body with some of the other brands.  I purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years."
298,298,298,299,5,"If you're looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals, this is a great option.  The taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters."
299,299,299,300,5,"I first found Steaz Berry Energy Shots at a local organic market. I bought two bottles, which cost just under three dollars each. I fell in love instantly. The drink is delicious -- I can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice, like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea. I am very sensitive to sucralose (Splenda) which is in so many energy drinks these days; I also hate the taste. I love that Steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners. The rush it gives me is slow and even. I have several medical conditions, including fibromyalgia, which saps me of energy and causes intense pain. I like how Steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get things done. No caffeine jitters, even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle.<br />It was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores, so I started looking online for a bulk price. I am so thrilled to have found the Pack Of 12 on Amazon. I signed up for Amazon Prime specifically for this product, hah!"
300,300,300,301,5,"I have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all, its also the best taste, others taste like medicine, this one has a tea fresh taste. I love it."
301,301,301,302,5,I drive OTR...Over the Road truck and this helps to keep me alert. It has no sugar high & no crash. I'm on a autoship which i like. The price is very good. I've seen it over 2 bucks in the store.
302,302,302,303,5,"Products takes pretty good, and it doesn't leave you gittery.  With subscibe and save as well as Prime membership I pay below $ 2 a shot.  My wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style.  I moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training.  I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an AWESOME Energy Drink."
303,303,303,304,5,"I use this product daily, and it provides a steady stream of energy.  I do not get jittery or crash.  It also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant."
304,304,304,305,5,"I've been buying and drinking this for over a year now, and the energy boost is excellent, with a continuous, ~6-hour effect. The most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well, or perhaps I'm getting more used to it. I don't drink it for the flavor, but it's not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other, non-organic energy shots."
305,305,305,306,1,"This is the first time I've really been misled by other reviews on amazon. I like 5-hr Energy, I find Rain ok and so I thought I'd try this product based on the reviews. Boy am I sorry! I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched (really). And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards. 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it! But worst of all, within an hour I was yawning and drowsy. Unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea-flavored cough syrup and don't work, don't buy this! I don't know what to do with the other 11 bottles. big fail"
306,306,306,307,4,"I loved this mold!  I wished I could have used it for more than one occasion, but it didn't last.  I did use it to make 30+ suckers for my daughter's first birthday. But there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that.  I would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions, but for the price it didn't matter to me that much.  It served it's main purpose :)"
307,307,307,308,5,"You HAVE to try the VANILLA Tootsie Rolls!  The regular chocolate ones are good, but THESE are the BEST EVER!!"
308,308,308,309,5,"Try this you might like it. I did and I am quite addicted, it is too easy to prepare, it tastes great and it absorbs the flavors you cook it with. The price is really good and well worth the purchase. If you like this type of Couscous like I do, then give this one a try.It can be eaten hot, room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors, it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed. I cooked the Couscous with a broth and oilive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time. I will be back for more."
309,309,309,310,5,"This tri-color couscous is really good...full of flavor and fun to eat.  I love the texture.  I cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs (parsley, cilantro,) along with some red pepper flakes.  At the end of cooking, I add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dish...Highly recommend"
310,310,310,311,5,"I tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck.  So I decided to try good ole Amazon.com and selected this product.  It is so good..add a few herbs and it's a great side dish, or add more and make a ""pasta type"" salad.so very good.  I am hooked.  Great flavor and so easy to prepare!"
311,311,311,312,1,"The package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions. I know how I normally cook Couscous so tried 3/4 cup water to 1 cup couscous-brought to a boil and let sit, covered for 5min. It was mushy and tasteless.We have thrown out the rest of the container."
312,312,312,313,1,I wouldn't even think of buying this product unless I know the price per unit. How can I compare other items online or in a store?
313,313,313,314,5,"I love ordering whole bean coffee on Amazon.  I like this so much that this my first product review.  I have to say that I'm usually not a big fan of flavored coffee, but I thought I would give it a try.  When my husband started grinding it up, I could smell it throughout the house.  Sometimes with flavored coffees, the smell is there but the taste isn't.  However, not with this one.  I'm now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try."
314,314,314,315,5,"I love this coffee. I do wish it came already ground as I don't have a grinder and use a blender instead. But it's worth it. Many flavored coffees I've tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesn't reach the coffee, but this one manages both."
315,315,315,316,5,"This brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time -- I've believe the company is local.  I've been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it.  I'm particularly fond of the Turtle Sundae but all the flavors are good.  I can't say that I've had a bad one.<br /><br />As it turns out, it's less expensive to order it from Amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local Walmart to get it.  It's a no brainer.  Try it, if you like rich, flavored coffee, you'll like it."
316,316,316,317,5,"It is hot! I love it, tasty and a little sweet. I usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot, but this one lives up to its billing."
317,317,317,318,5,"I consume about a jar every two weeks of this, either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip.  It is hot, but after awhile the medium Salsa Suprema was too mild for me; I thought maybe I'd cut down how much I ate by going to the hot Salsa Ranchera.  It's hot enough that people who aren't used to it will say ""That's hot!"".<br /><br />Flavor: bright and forward.  The similarly hot Salsa Victoria is a duller taste to me, I guess earthy.  This salsa is much brighter in the mouth.  I don't like to go hotter than this because the sauces I've tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot (this happens to me with Tabasco sauce, for example).<br /><br />A drawback is La Victoria doesn't make a larger bottle of Salsa Ranchera nor Salsa Victoria, nor do they sell them in [...] or Sam's Club.  To get a good deal you have to watch for sales."
318,318,318,319,5,"service was great, but I meant to buy Swiss Chalet chicken SAUCE not the Marinade :)<br /><br />Love the sauce - have yet to try the marinade"
319,319,319,320,5,"Use frequently as we like to do Asian dishes at least once a week.  Love this product.  Fast shipping, as usual.  Would buy again."
320,320,320,321,5,"These individually wrapped pieces are delicious (although I wish there were a few more). Mildly sweet with no sugar-free aftertaste, even a traditional ""marzipan-aholic"" should enjoy these."
321,321,321,322,5,Put this in my husbands stocking for Christmas and it was a hit.
322,322,322,323,3,"I was amazed at how quickly it arrived!  It is a cute stocking stuffer, but only OK as far as user appeal.  You get what you pay for."
323,323,323,324,3,Toy was typical quality I expected.  I got taken for a major ride on the shipping!
324,324,324,325,1,So we cancelled the order.  It was cancelled without any problem.  That is a positive note...
325,325,325,326,5,i love the convenience of the singles. The best creamer around.Taste is just like the big bottle. I can stick them in my purse and take them to work.
326,326,326,327,5,"These creamers come in 4 packs of 25. I have taken one to work and opened one for home so far, and haven't found a single broken or leaking creamer yet. I usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee, but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because I won't allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup. I think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from Amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping!"
327,327,327,328,4,"Even though we are International Delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product. We had no problem with the shipment, but the creamer itself is thinner than International Delight. Other than that we are happy :D"
328,328,328,329,5,"Besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers, I liked this item specifically because of packaging. I couldn't believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups; but many of the Amazon creamer options (both Coffeemate and International Delight) had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging.<br /><br />That was not an issue here. The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each (as shown in the photo); those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes. Thus, none of my cups were broken, no waste and no sloppy drippy mess. Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom (we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig - best idea my husband ever had), and one at work, with a reserve for whichever runs out first.<br /><br />If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options, this is your best bet. As a bonus, the auto delivery price is very reasonable."
329,329,329,330,5,"This seller is very nice.  And the price is very good.  The only reason I stop ording is bacause I went to sugar free, and at that time he did not have it.  But for those of you that don't have to watch there fat in take, I would get this product from them."
330,330,330,331,5,"I purchased these coffee mate singles to use at work along with the coffee ""tea"" bags.  They're great because they don't require refrigeration."
331,331,331,332,1,"I received the items in a timely manner. Upon receipt, I removed a pack to consume. The pop-tart was STALE and left an awful taste in my mouth."
332,332,332,333,5,"I found these new spring Pop-Tarts and bought them on a whim.  My kids and I were amazed and delighted at the fun, colorful, amazingly detailed artwork on these Pop-Tarts.  Fantastic for after school snacks, lunch boxes, and school treats. Tie with a ribbon for a bright ""thinking of you this spring"" gift.  The only challenge is finding more in stores.  Way to go Kellogg's - fantastic product!"
333,333,333,334,5,"Yes, I am having a cup right now.  I went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee.  I paid and extra 20 bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money. Highly recommend."
334,334,334,335,1,"Taste like it is stale.  Will not order this again.  I had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it.  This stuff tasted NOTHING, like the Douwe Egberts at the hall.  This is possibly stale coffee."
335,335,335,336,1,"Serveice delivery with the seller was excellent. The product was not. Will not order again. Bad taste. Iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes. I throw it right away, i coudl not drink it."
336,336,336,337,5,"This is honestly THE BEST seasoning salt in all the land.  It tightens up any dish; not spicy, just perfectly seasoned.  It's perfect, hence, my purchase of this 35 oz. mamma jamma."
337,337,337,338,5,"The order arrived as advertised. I have had only a few chances to use it, but it is awesome. The flavor is exactly what I hoped for! It may take me a while to finish the entire gallon, but I will definnantly order again!"
338,338,338,339,5,"I like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly.  Great quality, flavor and aroma.  Can't beat that its organic!"
339,339,339,340,5,"Bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months, and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat.  I cut up cantaloupe, apple, banana (even used sweet potatoes a few times)-- just whatever I could get at the restaurant-- and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat!  It's great because I didn't have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks, and he got to try out new foods.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again."
340,340,340,341,4,"I have a slightly different version of this - different brand.  My son started using it around six months, and he really enjoys it.  He DOES get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon, but whatever...  Anyway, I also had trouble cleaning it, until I tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush.  That works pretty well.  It takes some time, but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender, or cut it up, then clean it up off him, the chair, the floor, the dog, me, well you get the picture."
341,341,341,342,5,"What a GREAT idea!!!! My daughter love it.<br />I don't think is difficult to wash, I mean, is not like just toss water and that's it... but, come on!!!!<br />Absolutely recommend it!"
342,342,342,343,3,This product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned.  I couldn't get the food pieces out to save my life. I tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests.
343,343,343,344,5,"I loved this product for fruits and other food that I didn't want my new baby to choke on.  I also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething. It worked great for this, as well as for the food. I didn't like bananas in it though-impossible to get clean!"
344,344,344,345,3,"I love, love, love the idea of this product and my little one loves, loves, loves to use it.  She gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and I don't have to worry about her choking.  The only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out.  Granted, some foods are more difficult than others and some don't cause that much of a problem.  Bananas however, have pretty much destroyed a couple of them.  While I love this product, I think that next time I will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags."
345,345,345,346,3,"The Munchkin fresh food feeder is an okay product, it's kind of like sucking on food through a cloth. While my daughter was interested in it for a little while, she eventually lost interest. I may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts."
346,346,346,347,4,"This product is amazing. I know a few people with little ones that use these and they LOVE them!! Super easy to clean and use. When ordering these, I was under the impression that there were 2 per package...FYI-they're not!! Only one per..."
347,347,347,348,5,I ordered these for my coffee themed wedding. When they arrived I had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good. I literally had to hide the box to the wedding! They were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables. It was a great tasting product for the lowest price I've seen!
348,348,348,349,5,"""These are delicious! The chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose. Crunchy and not bitter.""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067AD4U"">Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans 5 Pounds</a>"
349,349,349,350,5,"The product was exactly as advertised and fresh.  Unfortunately, I keep them in a candy dish in the office and they are going fast.  We need to reorder to keep up with ""demand"""
350,350,350,351,5,"These chocolate covered espresso beans are wonderful!  The chocolate is very dark and rich and the ""bean"" inside is a very delightful blend of flavors with just enough caffine to really give it a zing."
351,351,351,352,5,"Popchips are so good.  I have been following Weight Watchers and lost 50 pounds and am at my goal.  These Popchips are my salty crunchy indulgence.  They taste so  good,"
352,352,352,353,5,"I've purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix (which is a great product, by the way).  This is the highest price I've seen.  Whole Foods carries this item and it's been on sale there for $9.99 (that's Canadian dollars, too, as I'm in Canada).  It's even cheaper on Baker's Box's own website, and they're the company selling this product through Amazon. For a two-pack they should be charging $20 or less.  What gives?  I thought Amazon was where you could find competitive prices."
353,353,353,354,5,"The Sugar was sweet, that can not be denied.  As advertised, It didn't melt when baked either.  However, it will not do for your Liege Waffles/Gaufres what the larger pebbles of Belgian pearl will do.  These grains are smaller, think pretzel salt, or seed pearls."
354,354,354,355,5,"That's exactly what I was looking for to bake some chouquettes (puffs with small sugar pearls on top). Works great, yum!!"
355,355,355,356,5,This is what I was looking for and was missing it. The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India. Definitely recommend it.
356,356,356,357,5,"I bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than I'd original expected. (A common problem in some fruit wines.)<br /><br />This is, indeed, good strawberry flavor!  Just add to your sugary concoction (be it a baking good, a dessert or a drink) to either give strawberry flavor (or add to existing flavor), and presto, just about everyone will be licking their lips (and maybe fingers).<br /><br />For those interested, I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid."
357,357,357,358,4,"Great stuff and dependable, especially when there are a million brands ""out there"" to choose from.  I love the stuff.  For really high end desires, I go with the Apollo Olive Oils from California.  But I buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again."
358,358,358,359,4,"I hadn't tried (or heard of) till recently Weavers not it's my favorite. I am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and haven't found one yet, they're all so darned smooth. No bite, no after taste, a little pricy but still worth it. No worse price wise than starbucks or peets. Will keep running through the list here and see what happens. Love them all so far."
359,359,359,360,5,"Having always been a strict Peet's Coffee lover, I was reticent to switch brands but Weaver's won my heart!! The taste is clean and strong, the ethos is correct (organic, baby) and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate. Be still my caffeinated heart!"
360,360,360,361,5,"Go ahead and drink the other brands served at your neighborhood cafe if you must but make sure you have a stash of Weaver's Peru Organic Whole Bean at home to serve up to your friends and family who deserve the best coffee.  And when you go back to that corner cafe where people drink average coffee because they don't know better, take along a travel mug filled with Weaver's coffee from home and enjoy a real Cup of Joe.  Er, Weaver's."
361,361,361,362,1,"A very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream and/or honey. Definately not my cup of coffee. Oh, did i say it was bitter?"
362,362,362,363,5,"Im learning that Latin American and South American coffees have this distinct ""coffee"" caramelish finish.  As a Peets Coffee fanatics we learned that Weavers roaster was the roaster for Peet's and we are hooked !  I already reviewd the French and Organic blend, but I must say this coffee here is a perfect afternoon drink.<br />Met the weavers team at the Warner Brothers party and they gave me a half a pound of french roast.  Since them we are fans.<br />You wont be dissapointed !"
363,363,363,364,5,"I like eating these whenever I need an energy boost.<br />It has everything that I am searching for in a, ""To Go Snack"".<br />Fiber plus Chocolate is never a bad thing!!!"
364,364,364,365,5,These are my favorite bars ever. The combo of raisons and dark choc is wonderful! Very filling! These are hard to find in the stores. I'm thankful for subsrcibe and save!
365,365,365,366,5,"My fiance loves these dark chocolate and nut granola bars and all the grocery stores around us don't carry them anymore!  Once again, Amazon came through and he couldn't be happier."
366,366,366,367,5,"I was buying Quaker Oats granola bars but these Nature Valley chewy bars are better tasting, they make a great snack when I'm on the go. Chocolate, peanuts and raisins...it doesn't get any better."
367,367,367,368,5,"Hard to get husband to eat breakfast before school.  He takes two bars now and is very happy to do so.  It is often hard to find flavor in local grocery stores.  So again, Amazon.com came through with a reasonable price.  Now, I came keep the husband's breakfast ready as he runs out the door in the mornings.  I often like to have a bar in the evening as a night snack."
368,368,368,369,4,"""Nantucket Blend coffee is one of my favorites.  I was suprised that it was a single box.  every time I ordered before it was a 2 pack.  My fault for not reading closer.  I will not order any more at this price for 1 (24 count)"

This is a very smooth tasting brew that my wife prefers over the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>] I generally drink in the morning.<br /><br />These are good on both ""Small"" and ""Large"" cup settings as well.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
370,370,370,371,4,"When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors. Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand. I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE"">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!"
371,371,371,372,5,Green Mountain is my favorite brand. Nantucket is my favorite coffee from Green Mountain. Very smooth flavor. Not too strong and not too weak.
372,372,372,373,4,"I was looking for a replacement for Timothy's Kona Blend which is no longer carried on Amazon.  This coffee from Green Mountain is very nice, but not strong enough for me.  If you like milder coffees, then this one is for you."
373,373,373,374,5,"One of Green Mountains best blends of coffee in my opinion,love it for your everyday blend, perfect stregnth, excellent blend!"
374,374,374,375,5,"This is just Fantastic Chicken Noodle soup, the best I have ever eaten, with large hearty chunks of chicken,and vegetables and nice large noodles. This soup is just so full bodied, and is seasoned just right.  I am so glad Amazon carries this product.  I just can't find it here in Vermont."
375,375,375,376,5,"I have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking,  I love the regular, I use it on everything. You won't be sorry you tired it, great for dipping bread and cooking omelet, and green beans."
376,376,376,377,5,"Oh my gosh, is this good!  Like most people, I've been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it.  Then Hubby brought a jar of this home.  The tomato flavor is amazing.  I will never buy store ketchup every again."
377,377,377,378,5,"Sir Kensington's did a great job of updating the classic ketchup with this wonderful product. The refreshed taste of this Ketchup is a great update, and now leaves me disappointed when I'm given Heinz while out at a restaurant.<br /><br />For you Heinz die hard fans out there, this is not the ketchup for you. But for those of you who wish you always knew what ketchup could be without the chemical aftertaste found in Heinz, be sure to give this Ketchup a try.<br /><br />Don't forget the spiced variety. Purchasing the pack with both the classic and spiced variety for your first Sir Kensington experience is definitely the way to go."
378,378,378,379,5,"This is ridiculous.  The best gourmet ketchup I have ever tasted.  It is pricey, but wow..love this stuff.  It would make a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for but loves their ketchup.  Yummy!"
379,379,379,380,5,The tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor.  It is clean and really fresh!  Perfect on an avocado chicken sandwich.<br /><br />The spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup I have ever tried.  It is so good I have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy!
380,380,380,381,3,"The spicy version of this ketchup isn't bad, but it is too expensive.  The regular version is sweet as dessert.  Horrible.  Annie's Organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less.  Even Heinz organic is a better deal.  I gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass, not plastic."
381,381,381,382,1,These condiments are overpriced and terrible. The classic is disgustingly sweet. The spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant.
382,382,382,383,5,"I have been using porcini mushrooms in my cooking for twenty plus years. The Roland extra fancy porcinis that I purchased from you are the best that I have ever used, including the mushrooms that I bought in Italy and transported back to the USA."
383,383,383,384,5,"I was pretty pleased with these mushrooms. They were mostly large pieces, re-hydrated well and had good flavor. I'd estimate about 25% of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces, most likely due to the shaking about in transit. Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount (perhaps an ounce or so) of very small/minced-size/dust-like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!<br /><br />The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.<br /><br />I'm quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom-infused water.<br /><br />This was the first time I used the Roland brand (got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse), and would certainly buy them again. Highly recommend."
384,384,384,385,5,"If you are a peanut lover, these are for you. Much larger than cocktail peanuts. Six people on my Christmas gift list ask for these every year!!"
385,385,385,386,5,"The cashews were nice and big, with the vast majority being whole.  There were a number of small pieces at the bottom of the bag, but that's pretty expected with so many cashews.  They made an absolutely excellent cashew brittle.<br /><br />My order took just over a week to arrive, which was pretty decent considering it was shipped across the country.  They came double bagged in clear plastic bags, and in two 5 lb portions.  This was highly convenient since I could just throw one of the bags into the freezer until I was ready to work with it.<br /><br />Great value for the price."
386,386,386,387,4,"Although there were several ""shriveled"" ones, they taste just fine.  I mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they don't have to look perfect anyways.  For the price, they are a great deal (about half of what I find them for in the store)"
387,387,387,388,5,"I ordered these after a fair bit of searching online - even ordering the smaller 1-3oz bags. I will admit, I was a bit sceptical when I ordered this since it was not cheap and had no idea how good (or bad) the cashews would be...<br /><br />The order came in pretty fast - like 3 days. The cashews were fresh and whole - with like 10 broken pieces. They were in 2 5lb bags sealed with clear tape.. first I found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal; considering the second pack stayed fresh till I opened them. The trick is to actually keep them in an air-tight box so that they stay fresh longer.<br /><br />The only negative I can think of is that the price went up abt $5.00 for the 10lb since I bought them."
388,388,388,389,5,These nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty.  They are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can.
389,389,389,390,4,"I bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted pecans in salads that I have at a couple of restaurants. Plus, he likes nuts, pecans, almonds peanuts. He loved these. I actually ordered 3 cans instead of the gift tin, so he could take one to work, or his place, and stay fresh longer. Although I don't think freshness will be an issue, they won't last long......lol"
390,390,390,391,2,"My cat will go for a day, probably longer, haven't tryed it, but he'll walk right by this stuff every time, even when I know he's hungery. ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST. I swear he'd rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it!!"
391,391,391,392,5,Got this free with another order I placed.  I couldn't believe how much the cats loved it. I will buy again for sure.
392,392,392,393,5,This is a great ham soup base.  I have used it in Ham and beans and seasoned greenbeans.  Great flavor
393,393,393,394,1,I haven't used the ham base. It is loaded with MSG. I did not realize this when I ordered it and can not return it because it is a food item
394,394,394,395,5,Before I discover this mix on Amazon I always bought it in Whole Food Store.<br />I like this mix and when I am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffy.<br />Just one small secret: Try to add the Seltzer water instead of regular one.
395,395,395,396,5,I appreciate the fact that I can buy this product online and have free shipping. This is a great all around mix that is very good with a wonderful texture. Thanks again amazon.
396,396,396,397,5,"Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake mix is my favorite mix.  It tastes great, cooks up light and fluffy and is super easy to make.  Although it can be made using water, I think it's better made with milk.  I love it with pure organic maple syrup."
397,397,397,398,5,The pancakes taste great without any recipe adjustments for my son's egg allergy.  It's also great for camping or any time you'd like to be able to make pancakes without having fresh eggs available.
398,398,398,399,5,"HEY! These are GREAT Waffles and Pancakes! We have to add 50% more mix, tho, as the recipies on the bag are VERY thin. But we have a lot of fun with this Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake & Waffle Mix! We serve them ""as is"" with fried eggs and REAL maple syrup, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002483TSQ"">Butternut Mountain Farm Vermont Pure Maple Syrup, Grade A Dark Amber, 1 Pint Jug</a>, or with warm strawberry jam and whipped cream, or Cool Whip, or add brown sugar to the mix to change the flavor and make a crispy waffle, or add 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup malted milk powder <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4HVC"">Carnation Malted Milk, Original, 13-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)</a>, for awesome gourmet pancakes and waffles like they serve at the Hilton! Its handy to have extra bags on hand, too, and you cant beat the Subscribe and save price. This mix is 70% ORGANIC, too!"
399,399,399,400,4,We are glad we found this mix as we make pancakes without eggs for my son who has an allergy.<br />They taste fine for our family- we like them many ways!
400,400,400,401,3,I love the flour however Amazon sent it with a book which broke a bag and made a mess. Customer sevice took care of the problem however it was a foolish way to ship the product.
401,401,401,402,1,This mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping. Nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box. 3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top. There were no tears in the packages.
402,402,402,403,1,"Just awful!  I thought food was supposed to taste good!  I had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth, it's that bad."
403,403,403,404,1,"Perhaps the worst bottle of wine I've ever had. I'm not even sure I would cook with this. It is thin, no body, and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot.  The taste is just bitter - not the complexity that I expect from a pinot noir of any price. Just not what I'm looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir. Maybe my bottle wasn't sealed well and went to vinegar - other reviews for this wine are favorable."
404,404,404,405,5,A good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition.  Everyone get the munchies....is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips!
405,405,405,406,5,"This is a wonderful warm flavored tea, especially now in colder weather.<br />This tea has a sweet,soothing chamomile fragrance. It is subtle and sweet.It's one of the better chamomile teas.<br />If you find it hard to sleep at times, a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help.<br />If you really like sweet taste try Bigelow Chamomile Mango Herbal Tea.<br />I highly recommend both."
406,406,406,407,5,"This is one of the best mint chocolate syrup I've ever had so far.  The others pale in flavor by comparison.  There are only seven ingredients in this sauce, including organic natural mint flavor.  In the past I used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch, chocolate chips, Oreo cookies, caramel et al, because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale.  Now I buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the Santa Cruz Organic Mint Chocolate syrup really stands out but doesn't overpower the flavor of the ice cream. There are only 110 calories.  And because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste, I use it sparingly, so this 15.5 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups I used."
407,407,407,408,5,"This is a simple product and it is simply good.  There are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you scouring the internet finding out what they are.  It is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup, so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out.  This will be great for people who like mint, it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate.  I use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half, tastes great.  Sometimes simple is better."
408,408,408,409,5,"A grande item !  Delicious fish with the ultimate flavor, best  ever in a can for all purposes !  I sent a case to my Mother recently diagnosed with Diabetes, and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties !"
409,409,409,410,5,"I ordered this product at the same time as the Kirkland Signature salmon.  The Raincoast Trading Co. salmon is very tasty, equally as good quality salmon as the Kirkland.  However, the Raincoast arrived in perfect condition, the Kirkland cans were dented badly.  I recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon."
410,410,410,411,5,"This tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an Indian restaurant. It's much better than getting a teabag and making it the English way, with a lot of water and a bit of milk. This is very creamy and tasty. My only criticism is that there aren't enough sachets in the box. Only 10. Since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water (approximately half a cup), it's not enough for a good cup of tea, so I use two. That means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea. But it's a delicious after-dinner drink! I would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box."
411,411,411,412,5,"i love this product cant find it locally. Sometimes little out of the way stores have it.But i also love the chicken,pork chop bags.Every store i go in i look for them the lastplace i found it was at a meat market."
412,412,412,413,5,This is the best way to cook a roast.  Our local grocery went out of buisness and so I could not find this product till I looked here.  Please continue to keep this product available!
413,413,413,414,5,It's always a pleasure to find French's products on the web.  All of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but McCormacks bland and tasteless seasonings.<br /><br />This is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find.
414,414,414,415,5,"If you like Oreo's or the Oreo cakester, then you've got to try the Double Stuff cakesters!!! These are the best!! Side note: shipping was very slow, but maybe your chances will be better."
415,415,415,416,5,"I was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when I told them I bought this. But out of the can ready mix with a little salt, pepper, spinach, and some cheese and it's a great easy meal!"
416,416,416,417,5,"The thing about Marmite is that those who don't like it hate it, and those who love it can't live without it.  It's very much ""an English thing"" and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor (as in ""Victoria Beckham is Marmite"" meaning that those who don't like her...etc.).  Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price.  Last time I looked, it was $25 a 500g jar in British stores in L.A.County, or about 4x what it costs in England.  The Amazon supplier was quick and efficient, and I now have enough Marmite to last me to the end of the year (or would have, if I didn't decide to send one of the two jars to my son in Japan!).  Good job, Amazon!"
417,417,417,418,1,"A vile, miserable pancake. I put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cried. I don't know if it was their flat and anemic appearance or their salty bitter taste. Only the whole wheat flour is organic in this mix. The buttermilk, baking soda (SLS) and sea salt are not. I am going back to Nature's Path Buttermilk pancake mix. This one went straight into the garbage."
418,418,418,419,5,Whats there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie! The only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast. Hope these don't go the way of the dinosaur!
419,419,419,420,4,These arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap.  The cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery store.<br /><br />I have no complaints but I also now have no more cookies. We ate them all!
420,420,420,421,5,"I was not expecting to like these cookies as much as I do. I like chocolate chip cookies well enough, but I really prefer a soft cookie to crisp ones. I have to say these Famous Amos cookies have pertty much turned me around. The cookies are rich and have that depth of flavor that comes from quality ingredients. The chips are real chocolate and melt redilly in your mouth creating a moist experience while chewing. These are truly great cookies."
421,421,421,422,5,"They aren't fattening and they're good for you, right? That's what I heard, at least, from an admittedly unreliable person."
422,422,422,423,4,"Great if you are cutting back on fat, they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them. Extremely dry and hard."
423,423,423,424,5,"I have never met a Kettle brand chip I did not like. These chips have a great loaded potato flavor, which are flavorful. I like the sweet onion chips better, but these are also at the top of the list for great-tasting potato chips. Kettle chips are great chips f/the money!"
424,424,424,425,5,"After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.<br /><br />These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.<br /><br />The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.<br /><br />Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out."
425,425,425,426,4,"I buy mostly for vending, so the size of the bag is important. Kettle's 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full. Salt & Vinegar flavor is satisfying, about an 8 out of 10."
426,426,426,427,4,Glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full. It's hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well. Sometimes they are too wide. or too plump with air. Bag size is good. BBQ flavor is about an 8 out of 10.
427,427,427,428,5,"one of the best chips that you can buy...and i've tried all the kettle varieties, and many others.  There's only a slight taste of jalapeno, and they are delicious. Perfect with a sandwich or alone.<br />If you like being addicted, these are the chip for you. ...See you at addicts anonymous..."
428,428,428,429,5,"The title says it all. Great flavor, hint of spice, excellent crunch. We eat Kettle chips by the truck load at my house, we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite, never enough bags to get us to our next shipment. I just wish Amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save! If you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself!!!"
429,429,429,430,5,"WOW!  I have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day. Kettle chips are the BEST non-baked chips I have eaten. I decided to try the sweet onion chips, since I've never had them. I now have a FAVORITE!! If you like onions, this is a MUST buy! I will definitely reorder these, as I mentioned above, they are the BEST I have ever eaten! The flavor is GREAT."
430,430,430,431,5,"I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC"">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control."
431,431,431,432,5,"Now, I haven't done a side-by-side comparison, but these chips still taste like the real deal. These snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store I work for. Portion control AND reduced fat? Yes, please!  With the Subscribe & Save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store."
432,432,432,433,4,"I love Kettle Brand Chips!<br />I've been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors.<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar Chips are TANGY, SOUR, and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time.  I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon ($11 WHAT?!?).<br /><br />Personally, the flavor is too much for me, but my mom & aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips."
433,433,433,434,5,These chips are thick and crunchy.  I absolutely love them.  The taste is perfect.  I like to buy these smaller bags because I cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good.
434,434,434,435,4,"I enjoy these chips. I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change. I think those are better but only slightly, like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering. The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag."
435,435,435,436,5,"I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor."
436,436,436,437,5,"These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.<br /><br />I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving)."
437,437,437,438,5,"I have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a year.I love them,but my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favorite.Will be ordering them."
438,438,438,439,5,These are my favorite gluten-free dairy-free flavored chips.  Many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so it's nice to find ones that I can eat.  The vinegar flavor is really intense and good.
439,439,439,440,4,"These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and ""spices."" I'm not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions ""tear here."" So easy. Why didn't I think of that."
440,440,440,441,3,"Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips."
441,441,441,442,5,"For me, Kettle is the best brand on the market. They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods! I didn't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips, but these are my new favorite. The flavors are pure and real. They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive! I hope they come out with a low fat version; their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors."
442,442,442,443,4,Salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip. These ones made by Kettle were very tasty and I enjoyed them thoroughly. I just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste.
443,443,443,444,5,"What I like about them:<br />1) Very thick chips.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing.<br />4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil."
444,444,444,445,5,"These are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many, a handful or two does the trick. Very crisp and savory."
445,445,445,446,3,"I usually love Kettle Chips, and love salt & vinegar, but these chips were way too vinegary for me! They do have the typical kettle chip crunch, but are too aggressively flavored for my taste."
446,446,446,447,4,"I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!"
447,447,447,448,5,Tried many varieties of BBQ chips and hands down these are the BEST on the market! These R not too salty or greasy. Great crispy crunch. Plenty of good BBQ flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of. Every bag (after bag) is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st!!
448,448,448,449,5,"Kettle chis are the best ever! These used to be my favorite flavor until I tried their Salt and Pepper kind but I'm sure this is just a personal preference.<br /><br />Crunchy, real potato chips!"
449,449,449,450,5,"These chips have the right amount of crunch and I enjoy the taste. Chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning. I like the 2-oz size bags, just the right amount of chips."
450,450,450,451,5,"I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!<br /><br />The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case from the kids!"
451,451,451,452,3,"OK,I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful. I took the plunge as I do like salty, and tangy flavors. No, I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price. They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date  FEB 2011. Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)"
452,452,452,453,5,"This was the best deal ever. The delivery was fast, the chips are delicious and very fresh.  Love it:)"
453,453,453,454,5,My husband and I LOVE these chips! Personally I think the flavor is perfect. Try them for yourself!
454,454,454,455,5,"The barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect! Just spicy enough, a hint of sweetness, just a little smokey. The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial, but not hard. This makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers, hot dogs or brats, chicken or just about any casual entree."
455,455,455,456,5,"I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store, Lunds, but they were on sale, so I bought a bag.  I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?  I don't know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting."
456,456,456,457,5,"As a professional potato chip muncher, I see these as thee very BEST on the market. Rich taste and flavor!! Almost impossible not to finish the entire bag.The true meaning of decadence!"
457,457,457,458,5,"These are hands-down the absolute best Salt & Vinegar chips you can buy.  They have a great, strong flavor that has left me addicted.  These are certainly my favorite chips.  I highly recommend trying them!"
458,458,458,459,5,"Oh, I love these chips! And they're so hard to find where I am, and when I do find them, they're usually $1-2 more per bag for less. Great that these are so cheap here at Amazon."
459,459,459,460,5,"I LOVE these chips!  It is a little weird to review potato chips.  But these chips are great. The crunch is just right, plus they have just the right amount of salt. Not to salty not too bland. They are a little oily but that's ok. The best thing is the 2 oz package. When I buy a larger bag it's harder to resist eating them all.  This 2 oz package allows for a little ""portion control"". Be sure to use your scissors to open, 'cause these chips are packaged for freshness and don't open easily. Enjoy!"
460,460,460,461,4,"In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips,  from the best I've ever had to big disappointments.  If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products.  Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors.  All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice."
461,461,461,462,4,"these chips are good, and bad, and create moral dilemmas constantly. If wou are strong at will, or having a large BBQ go for it, but as for me, i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days, had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it. BEWARE"
462,462,462,463,5,"Kettle Chips flavors can be hit or miss.  Some of their flavors are terrible.  But this is very simple and delicious.  Probably one of their best flavors.<br /><br />Pros: Thick, crunchy potato chips with light salt that doesn't compromise on taste, eco-friendly business that isn't just giving us lip service<br /><br />Cons: The occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open.  They have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time I end up tearing down the entire side of the bag.  Use scissors instead."
463,463,463,464,5,"We bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in Sonoma while we were on vacation. I wasn't sure what to expect by the package, and at first bite I didn't know what to think...and then all of the flavors hit!<br />Yum! They are a bit spicy, but nothing overpowering. Just lots of crunchy, sweet, spicy goodness. They aren't sold everywhere though, I'm still trying to find them somewhere close to where I live."
464,464,464,465,5,"I have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive. I can't stop eating them!!! It's crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt. Just perfect!!! Believe me, some chips are so salty, I can't finish a small bag. But this one... I just keep on eating!"
465,465,465,466,5,These are some of the best chips that I have ever had... They sure beat anything else out there and are even cooked in a way that is better for you than most other name brands. They are tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time! These will be the only chips that I buy from now on and I thank amazon for letting me buy them online in bulk and save some money at the same time!
466,466,466,467,5,"I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes.

468,468,468,469,5,These chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school. They are by far the tastiest chips I've had and it's impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag!
469,469,469,470,5,"These are by far my favorite chips, they are extremely crunchy (similar to other Kettle style chips), but it's the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks.  I've tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close."
470,470,470,471,4,"They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture. All around this brand is much better than Frito-Lay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping. These are similar to Tim's or Zack's chips in that they are very crispy.<br /><br />On a side note, these are the hardest bags to open by hand. I have to use a knife or scissors everytime."
471,471,471,472,4,It took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you. They sure were eaten all up by my family and friends.
472,472,472,473,4,"These are delicious.  The 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches, definitely more than a serving."
473,473,473,474,4,"I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of ""brown"" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag."
474,474,474,475,5,"We are always pleased with Amazon's packaging. Chips are never crushed or broken, always fresh. We really liked this brand/flavor of chips. Very tasty!"
475,475,475,476,5,"These chips are some of the best I've tasted. They are not filled with chemicals. You taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato. Not greasy. Perfectly crispy. If you don't like salt and vinegar tanginess, don't even bother to try. These definitely have zip. I love them. My children and their friends love them. Even my 4 year old loves them!"
476,476,476,477,5,"These chips were a great deal.  Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips.  They are hard to find in Vegas and are my favorite flavor. Shipping was very fast, sooner than expected."
477,477,477,478,5,fantastic!you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover
478,478,478,479,4,Eat at your own risk.  Once I would open a bag I could not stop.  Good and salty.
479,479,479,480,5,"I don't eat many chips, but these I love. Great buy and arrived quick and packed great. Expiration date is a ways away, so I have awhile to enjoy them Great natural potato flavor. I love brown russet, hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee."
480,480,480,481,5,I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends.  :))  My experience with a lot of cheese-favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side.  But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind.  Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I don't have to buy them from the store anymore.
481,481,481,482,5,Bought this box of chips as a Father's Day gift because Dad loves them.  They are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips.
482,482,482,483,5,"These chips are quite tasty and the price is right.  Packaged very well, would buy again."
483,483,483,484,2,I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked.  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. So I don't know why these were different.<br />Will never buy these chips from here again.
484,484,484,485,5,For some reason Amazon would not ship these to Alaska!..so I sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them.  They are very good chips! Amazon should rethink the shipping to Alaska thing.  I would order groceries online.
485,485,485,486,4,"My husband likes these a lot. They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy. They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture. Not bad, though. Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health. They do have about 1/2 the calories in fat, however."
486,486,486,487,4,"Just got this order and it is ok. A bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me, if it is there."
487,487,487,488,2,"I really love Kettle brand chips, but these are rather disappointing. There is very little sour cream or onion flavor."
488,488,488,489,3,"I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste, a bit oily and overcooked. It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>. Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again."
489,489,489,490,5,"I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring? Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat."
490,490,490,491,2,"I agree with the other review, these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums. The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt/vinegar combo. Unfortunately, every bag I received in that case was over cooked! They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag. They definitely need to improve that!"
491,491,491,492,5,We love Kettle Chips Lightly Salted and don't feel guilty eating them!  We used to buy them at Whole Foods but buying from Amazon has saved us money.  We have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery.
492,492,492,493,5,"A friend of mine brought these into work with the claim , ""these will change your life!""  While my life is fairly unchanged, I cannot get enough of these chips . . . . and I do not even like kettle chips.  For the most part, I find Kettle Chips to be too thick and greasy, but the flavor of these chips is amazing!  The are the type of hot that is refreshing.  If you do not enjoy spicy or hot things . . . try these anyway, they may convert you."
493,493,493,494,5,"But if you happen to, like me, there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip I've found in this country."
494,494,494,495,5,"These are the best potato chips I've ever tasted.  It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping.  The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great."
495,495,495,496,5,"i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them. they are really amazing. i love cheddar too, but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor. i recommend them."
496,496,496,497,5,"This is easily the best potato chip that I have ever had.  Look at the ingredients:  Ginger and 3 types of hot pepper.  How can you go wrong?<br /><br />Obviously, not for you if you don't like spicy food. But, if you DO like spicy food, you'll probably love these.  They have that hot-with-a-hint-of-sweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of Thai food."
497,497,497,498,4,"Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard."
498,498,498,499,4,"Okay, I should not eat potato chips, nor should anyone.<br />But these are so spicy, I would find it hard to eat<br />very many. That makes them an indulgence that<br />rescues some people from overindulgence."
499,499,499,500,5,"I don't write very many reviews but I have to say that Kettle Brand chips are the best I have ever tasted.  Every flavor is dynamite.  If you are feeling iffy about honey dijon, I would recommend cheddar beer, absolutely amazing.  And they're healthy!  (besides a lil fat)  I have eaten a lot of chips in my day and Kettle takes the cake.  Enjoy, and don't eat them too fast."
500,500,500,501,5,"I bought these for the office and no one can put them down. I'm ordering more today and it has only been 2 weeks. Didn't have to shop for them either, Amazon brought it to my door!"
501,501,501,502,2,It was a great value and I like the package size but not vinegary enough for me. Won't order this brand again. Great chips otherwise.
502,502,502,503,5,Perfect!! They are my favorite because I can season with a variety of spices to exactly suit my tastes without all the salt!
503,503,503,504,4,"Amazon's suggestion for a 4 star review is ""I like it.""  That being said, I gave a 5 star review to the Spicy Thai chips.  These chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip, but whose taste buds don't appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor.  The only thing I REALLY dislike about these chips (along with the rest of the flavors) is that the serving size is HALF the bag.  Really?  Who can eat half and save the rest for later???  Not me..."
504,504,504,505,5,"These are a favorite at our home. We like the ones that have Sea Salt. We also like Barbeque  flavored. These are not ruffly chips that have ridges. These are thickly cut plain slice potatoes. They are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth. They also have a great taste. The sea salt ones, which are a favorite, have just enough salt to have salt but not so much that you feel like you have to drink a gallon of water with your chips.<br /><br />Enjoy."
505,505,505,506,5,These are the best unsalted chips around and we have tried many.  They have the best potato flavor.  They came when you said they would.
506,506,506,507,5,"Great chips, great price.  Odds are that you will have them to yourself.  If you like your fish and chips soaked in malt vinegar, you will love these.  The best salt and vinegar chips I have ever had (and I love this flavor, mind you).  They are spectacular with deli sandwiches or on their own.  Since I have found that S&V is palatable to only the most intelligent of our species I know that my afternoon snack is all mine, unless of course I run into another heavy brained, hearty breathed like mind.  -Summary- If you like the taste of bitter sweet salty vinegar and a crispy chip to boot you wont pucker at the sight of these handily bagged morsels.  It is the first and only time I have committed to a whole case of chips and I will do it again.  Mmmmm... vinegar..."
507,507,507,508,2,I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain! They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that...it's annoying. I do not recommend this flavor..salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite.
508,508,508,509,1,"These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.<br /><br />For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case ""& Chive"") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips."
509,509,509,510,1,"Kettle chips now look, feel and taste like Lays.  These chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty.  Now, no longer my favorite."
510,510,510,511,5,Great price for an excellent chip. At about 80 cents for a 2 ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip. Everyone I've let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste. I've yet to find a Kettle chip that disappointed!
511,511,511,512,4,"I love these chips, which is why I bought them, to stock up for the entire school year. The chips taste great, and packages were all sealed and in good condition when the arrived. The box on the other hand was in tatters, with holes and complely squished... I don't know if that was a result of customs or the voyage, but to receive it was a bit disgruntling given it was falling apart. Luckily, there were no victims within. All the chips are as they should be."
512,512,512,513,3,This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. Not my taste.  Make sure you like salt & vinegar before ordering. You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before.  I'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips.
513,513,513,514,5,"TOTALLY ORGASMIC.  these chips are the best spicy chip i have ever tasted.  signed up for the subscribe and save option.  the case contained 15(FIFTEEN, FULL SIZED BAGS) OF CHIPS.  the price per unit equals $1.73  per package.  that is not even the cost of plain chips.  if you add the free shipping and the fast delivery, this deal is a steal.  so run like you stole something over to your computer and order the SPICY THAI CHIPS.  p.s.  even if you paid the going price of $30.00, you are still ahead of the curve.  ENJOY"
514,514,514,515,5,"Seriously, now. Tasty, tasty, tasty. Fresh, too!<br /><br />The only problem is that you have a pack of 24 and that can lend itself to wanting to make multiple trips to the cupboard for more helpings! Or, grabbing multiple bags to begin with. Pace yourself! I keep saying.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with these if you're a fan of the salt and vinegar classic flavor.<br /><br />2-ounce bags are about double the size of the kid's bags; about the same size as the ones in the small gas station racks. It's really a good size for an adult.<br /><br />It's a somewhat healthier snack than a typical bag of fried chips, but it has 300 calories per bag. Again, not too bad, but something to think about.<br /><br />Bottom-line: Delicious!"
515,515,515,516,5,"Despite coming in an extremely large box, I found this to be great value. All the bags were preserved with a reasonable expiration date that is months away. I'd definitely recommend."
516,516,516,517,1,"These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all.  I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck.  Give me pain chips any day.  Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips. I wish I could give these zero stars if I could."
517,517,517,518,4,"If you like spicy, then these are for you.  I like spicy, so I enjoyed these.  They're also crunchy, as kettle-cooked chips should be."
518,518,518,519,3,"These are decent, but if you want a realllly good salt and vinegar chip, try Boulder's Salt and Malt Vinegar chips.  THOSE are awesome."
519,519,519,520,2,"Being a salt-free product is why I purchased this, but the chips are quite greasy."
520,520,520,521,5,"These are the best potato chips that money can buy.  There is just enough salt to taste it, but not so much that it masks the lingering potatoey awesomeness after you've wolfed down a bag of these beauties.  Each chip has the perfect thickness - my teeth get excited every time I put one in my mouth!  Everything about these chips is so perfect, it's like they were made by God and delivered by Gabriel himself.  Now that I know Amazon carries these, I don't even have to leave my house to buy them!  I may never eat anything else again!"
521,521,521,522,3,"These things are just too darn cheesy. If you like a lot of flavor, you'll love these. Otherwise, you will overdose on their cheddary goodness."
522,522,522,523,5,"I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!  For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far.  It isn't easy, but ...<br /><br />Have I told you how much I love them?<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />Millennium Babe: The Prophecy"
523,523,523,524,5,"You don't need salt to hide the taste of potato chips. And these chips prove it. The taste of the potato comes through, instead of being masked. OK, so they're still a snack food, but no salt and no trans-fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if you're on a low-salt diet (like I am), having these available means I can eat chips, and Kettle are just the best."
524,524,524,525,5,"These potato chips are excellent.There are no trans fats.<br /><br />They taste absolutely delicious.Whenever I am in the mood for potatoe chips, Kettles is the brand I buy.<br /><br />A great product that anyone should enjoy and I highly recommend them!<br /><br />Enjoy!"
525,525,525,526,5,"It feels strange to review chips, but I am compelled because these are my absolute favorite chips. Kettle has lots of flavors but I always go back to these regular lightly salted.<br /><br />They are thicker and sometimes greasy at the bottom of the bag, plus they often looked burned. They are not actually burned. It has something to do with how much sugar is in the potato that makes it dark. I love to open a bag and find some browned chips.<br /><br />Lays and Wise have their place but I've become a chip snob thanks to Kettle.<br /><br />Like Edy's or Breyer's ice cream, some products are worth the money. These are the best of the best."
526,526,526,527,5,I have tried a lot of S&V chips and these are the best!  Real sea salt and REAL vinegar!  Mouth-watering flavor & crispiness.  Not for the faint of heart - the flavor is very authentic!  :)
527,527,527,528,5,"Kettle brand chips are very crunchy.  I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the ""soft"" end of the ""soft/crunchy"" spectrum.  Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy.  If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand.  Otherwise, you'll love these chips.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY.  I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time.  I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically.  Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt & Vinegar has a gourmet flavor.  The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy!"
528,528,528,529,1,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same..."
529,529,529,530,5,"Someone brought these to a party we had last month and I didn't put them out because the buffet was full and didn't think anyone would like saltless potato chips.  Last week we had some friends over and these were all I had in the pantry so I put them out.  OH MY GOSH THEY ARE SO GOOD!  I was so wrong to think they would be bland; they are full of real potato flavor, wonderfully crisp and very fresh tasting.  I am here on amazon to buy a case, I only want to have these with dips.  Truly delicious!"
530,530,530,531,5,These Backyard BBQ Kettle Chips were a great deal with the promo code.  It was nice to have a larger size bag.  Some Kettle Chips in the grocery store are only about 5 ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch!  They arrived fresh and were not in crumbles as some other chips from Amazon Grocery have been.  Great flavor and All Natural!
531,531,531,532,5,"I have tried Herrs, UTZ, wise, pringles, lays etc....but Kettle tasted the best. The quantity of salt used is the optimum which is required.<br /><br />Although they say serving size 1 ounce, you will finish the whole packet in no time. Total calories is 300 for 2 ounce bag. This is slightly on the higher side. But still it is ok, as they have not compromised on the taste.<br /><br />Only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips, which taste bad. Kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are there.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon to get 24 bags for just 12 bucks with free shipping using their coupon."
532,532,532,533,4,"Chips are not as tangy as I hoped or expected. Poore Brothers is a better choice for the ""hard-core"" Salt N Vinegar fans."
533,533,533,534,3,These bags had a lot of overcooked brown pieces. also felt very greasy. Had to keep wiping my fingers on a napkin.
534,534,534,535,3,"The first time I tried these, I thought, ""WOW!"" but I quickly found they were just too darn spicy and tart... Hard to enjoy the potato-chippiness of them when your mouth is under seige."
535,535,535,536,2,"Got these Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar (15 5oz bags) and was not impressed. Tasted kind of flat. I was eating some out of the bag, when I looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed. Then I started looking at all the unopened bags and MANY of them had this type same hole. Some bags had multiple holes. One bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it. The box they shipped in had NO holes so they we're packed this way. So much for quality control and who ever let these ship should be fired. Needless to say I'll never be eating anymore Kettle products and expect a full refund from Kettle or Amazon.<br />M. Martin"
536,536,536,537,5,"Chilling in the fridge seems to boost the flavor even more; and using them, rather than corn chips, to make nachos will have your tastebuds singing like Janet Jackson. (But without any of the associated wardrobe risks. (-:) HIGHLY recommended."
537,537,537,538,1,"When originally produced in England  these we're the best chips I had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the US conglomerate they now taste plain nasty. Hard rather than crispy, are much thinner than they used  to be and lacking any  flavour , a real shame."
538,538,538,539,1,after opening numerous bags I found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them. completely plain and gross. how does this even happen?
539,539,539,540,5,"I was getting VERY worried, when I read some of the other reviews here.  Specifically, the ""One Star"" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of ""United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers""....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the ""Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum""! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a ""Potato Chip Diet"".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!"
540,540,540,541,3,"These chips are okay.  Personally, I find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange.  They're not necessarily bad but they're the kind of chip where you're only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty."
541,541,541,542,1,"I've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning.  Keeps you from eating too many!  Occasionally I get really stale items from Amazon.com and this was one.  Unedible.  Beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case, not expired but stale and unedible just the same."
542,542,542,543,4,"These chips are VERY GOOD!! I couldn't stop eating them. They didn't last very long.<br /><br />The reason I gave them 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I think the bags are a little hard to open. I'm not sure why they need to make a potato chip bag that sturdy, you may need some scissors on hand to open them much easier."
543,543,543,544,1,"Kettle Brand chips used to be so good...oily, crunchy, flavorful. I suspect the company has been bought out and the recipe has been changed for the worse. Now they're no better than any other big name brand chip. Try the Good Health Kettle Style Olive Oil chips instead. They are as good as the Kettle Brand once was. R.I.P., Kettle Brand chips. :("
544,544,544,545,1,"...you can absolutely forget about these. Confirmed by other reviewers, these chips are now total garbage. Like chewing on styrofoam packaging ""peanuts"". Positively awful, no hyperbole or exaggeration. I'll NEVER buy anything from Kettle brand ever again! From a reportedly once great ""premium"" brand, literally any mass market chip I've ever tried tastes better than these. Stale and rancid tasting, and virtually no salty taste whatsoever. Completely awful!"
545,545,545,546,1,"These chips are nasty.  I thought someone had spilled a drink in the bag, no the chips were just soaked with grease.  Nasty!!"
546,546,546,547,2,"Unless you like salt vinegar chips as salty as eating actual pinches of salt and drinking actual vinegar, i doubt you will like these chips.  These are the saltiest & sourest chips I have ever had, and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because I paid for 2 full boxes and dont like to waste food.  The brown chips are especially bad, besides being salty and sour, they also taste overcooked and burnt.  Unless you are the rare kind that can take this kind of extreme taste, you will not like these chips.<br /><br />I actually have a high tolerance for sour taste, so I can down a bag of chips with a bit of difficulty.  But normal people, please do not try this at home."
547,547,547,548,1,I bought this brand as a trial since I am tired of the Pingos.<br /><br />It claims that it is natural. I have no argument on this. But the point is that more than 50% in the bag is over-fried and in brown color. I really suffer eating the over-fried chips. I open some other bags and it looks like the same. So I just throw away all of them. I don't know if I was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same. But for sure I will never buy this brand any more.
548,548,548,549,4,They are good but wish they were also baked. Have not found baked no salt potato chips anywhere. If there are any I wish someone would post.
549,549,549,550,3,These are better in England. I don't know why. Maybe it's just nostalgia on my part.
550,550,550,551,1,I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORS<br />SALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPER<br />TUSCAN 3 CHEESE<br />N.Y. CHEDDAR AND HERS<br /><br />THEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME.  IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZE.<br /><br />I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS.
551,551,551,552,1,"I purchased these because of the low salt, and they were indeed low in salt. However, many, many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil. I have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands. It was very unappetizing, and who wants all that oil? I will never buy these again, and I would not recommend them to others."
552,552,552,553,2,"If you are looking for STRONG S/V flavor these definitely aren't for you. Very mild in comparison to many others. I live in TX and I can tell you I've tried ALL S/V chips I can get ahold of. The best of the best are HEB (storebrand) and World Market. Bob's and Zapp's Aren't bad. From a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch, but if you're looking for S/V flavor these have ""just a touch."""
553,553,553,554,2,"I don't know if it was the case of chips we received or what, but everyone we allowed to sample the chips (in a buffet style setting) agreed that these were slightly on the salty side.<br />One person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow, due to the amount of salt in these.<br /><br />We had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips, but these Kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact opposite.<br /><br />Sorry folks, we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side.<br /><br />We are still looking forward to Amazon finally getting the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips in stock.<br />These got a 2 star, because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique."
554,554,554,555,1,"These chips are greasy and taste burnt-there is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it (especially at the bottom of the bag. Even if they are trans fat free, they need to be a lot less greasy."
555,555,555,556,1,"Don't waste your money on any of the Kettle brand potato chips.  I bought a case of these, and a case of the cheddar and sour cream.  Both cases ended up in the garbage can."
556,556,556,557,1,"DEfintely not as tasty as the Madhouse Munchies which are my family's favorite. Kettle's are dark/burnt,more broken bits, taste greasy-oily and not the light crunch. Oh well."
557,557,557,558,1,"I love sour food but this one I can't bear.  Too strong sour taste... and even when you open the bag, the sour smell is too strong.  I don't like it."
558,558,558,559,1,"Unless you really really really like vinegar - AVOID! Those chips should have been called ""Vinegar and Sea Salt"" - not ""Sea Salt and Vinegar""."
559,559,559,560,5,"I have loved Kettle Brand Sea Salt and Vinegar chips since the first time i tried them.  The fact that i was able to find them on-line for such a great price, was wonderful.  I would definitely make the purchase again.  THey are a quick and simple snack for lunch and it goes great with my cold sandwich."
560,560,560,561,1,"Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label ""yeast extract"".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore."
561,561,561,562,1,"The chips were great...for the first few bags. However, after the first bag or two, I noticed that the remaining bags were damaged. There were holes in each bag and black, sticky stains on the outside. Other reviewers who bought around the same time that I did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chips.<br /><br />The chips came in a sealed Kettle box, so it's hard to say who screwed up. But someone somewhere screwed up. These chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag. Now? It's like a game of roulette."
562,562,562,563,1,"After waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of 15 5oz bags to arrive, upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse.  Don't know if it is still in the box, but it is outside on the porch.  When my son gets home, I'm going to have pictures taken and email to Amazon.  The outside Amazon box was intact, so it had to be either from the Kettle Chips people or the Amazon warehouse, don't know which.  I will never buy these again from Amazon.  I cannot tell you how disgusted I am with this purchase.  It makes me sick to think about it!<br /><br />I included pictures at the top of the page.  Poor little mousie must have high cholesterol now.<br /><br />Update:  I forgot to mention that I offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to Amazon but was told they didn't want them."
563,563,563,564,5,"Kettle Chips are the best potato chip God has ever invented.  I give the Lord thanks every day for delivering unto me such an incredulously delicious blend of ginger and spice, a veritable cornucopia of flavor.  I have actually changed my diet to a strict regiment of the Spicy Thai & Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors, alternating days. I have already lost 5 lbs, not to mention the myriad of other health benefits I have been experiencing. Get your life back - with Kettle Chips."
564,564,564,565,5,"My daughter that has autism craves hot, spice and pungent foods.  These are her absolute favorite chips!  She calls them her sour chips and wants them in her lunch all the time.  I love the crispy kettle way they're cooked."
565,565,565,566,5,"I am a great fan of potato chips and of Thai food.  I was so happy when Kettle Chips decided to meld two of my great loves together! (What a concept.....)  These chips are spicy enough, without burning a hole in your tongue.  Also, they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming (careful!).  Once in a while, this is a treat definitely worth indulging in."
566,566,566,567,1,"Terrible! I cannot believe this, I received this item and EVERY SINGLE BAG WAS OPENED BUT 4!!!! I'm stationed in Afghanistan and this was gonna be a snack for my team while going out on missions. I was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box, gross! And the box is filled with grease stains. Idk if it was from the airplane ride all the way here, but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper. I'm very unhappy with stale crusty chips out the bag and us soldiers cannot enjoy now."
567,567,567,568,5,"After reading some of the reviews, I got nervous and opened a bag from my recent order expecting the worst! No worries here. All bags are in great shape and expiration dates aren't until June. Chips, at least from the first bag, taste like they are supposed to and all is good in the world! By the way, fifteen bags for under thirty dollars is a ton less expensive than the going price around here at the local grocery store so, yay team!"
568,568,568,569,1,"Kettle Branch Potato Chips New York Cheddar:  These are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty, on the burnt side, and taste rancid, either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old.  I want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then.  But, after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips, these just don't hit the spot for me."
569,569,569,570,5,I am glad I was able to find these on this site. I love this flavor and they are so crunchy. The box is packed inside another box but still some bags end up as crumbs. Most of the bags survived in tact.
570,570,570,571,5,"These chips taste awesome. And unlike most other flavored chips, they actually make sure that plenty of the flavory salty goodness gets on each individual chip. Just don't pass gas near any pretty ladies after consumption. They'll totally know it was you."
571,571,571,572,5,"With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: ""Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag""<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: ""At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are ""trans fat free"" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.""  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period."
572,572,572,573,5,"These are among the best chips I have ever eaten!  I first came upon them when I visited a CostPlus World Market store in Opelika, AL, in the Tiger Town Mall, in 2007.  I wasn't a big fan of dijon-flavored anything, but I decided to give these chips a try.  I was hooked.  I probably ended up buying over a dozen bags within just a few months' time.  I searched all over my part of Alabama (the northwestern part of the state) and could not find them.  I later tried to find them at the World Market in Hoover, at the Patton Creek Shopping Center, and they did not carry this flavor.  However, when I learned that they were available on Amazon.com, and also available for PRIME Shipping - I bought them as soon as I read ""Kettle Chips Honey Dijon, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)!""<br /><br />You get a pretty big box, filled with 12 bags of these delicious morsels.  They last quite a while, but I will re-order, very, very soon!  I suggest you buy them, in this bulk form, and enjoy them - you won't be disappointed!  They go great with hamburgers and hot dogs - so they're perfect for spring and this coming summer's outdoor activities and cook-outs!<br /><br />Take my word for it, these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods!  Buy some today, and fall in love like me!"
573,573,573,574,5,I have never been addicted to anything in my life...until I tasted these chips.  I have tried other brands of the sea salt and vinegar flavor and they are just not the same.  You've got to stick with this blue bag of chips!
574,574,574,575,5,"I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4"">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."""
575,575,575,576,5,I bought these when on sale through Amazon.  Nice crispy thick chips.  Definitely a great buy if you can catch them on sale.
576,576,576,577,1,"For those of you who, like me, had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally, you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed.  They are just like regular potatoe chips.  I paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he didn't like the spicy thai, but these are fine for him.<br /><br />Yuck!!!"
577,577,577,578,5,"I've found a new taste treat. I'm not a big one for potato chips, so I am sure I've come late to discover these. I think they are really good.  The processing & ingredients list is actually pretty good-no trans fats, etc. So, if you want an indulgence, these are A+ !  They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know.  They are much more flavorful.  Never had a honey-dijon potato chip before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!<br /><br />If you want a snack, have something REALLY good. It's got to be worth the calories-and these are!"
578,578,578,579,5,This is a real good product.I love these chips and so does my customers can't go wrong wit these the best
579,579,579,580,5,I love these chips and now the whole family is hooked on them. These are the only chips I eat
580,580,580,581,4,I don't know what to say that others have not covered. If you like potato chips you will like these. Get em on sale when you can and limit your intake...if you can...
581,581,581,582,5,If you're looking at this you probably already know you like these chips.<br />This is a great deal and I have not had any problems with them going stale.<br />The 1oz bags are a great size for a snack and help avoid over-eating.
582,582,582,583,1,"While I admit that the oversalted chip is addictive, I really think this one has gone too far. Skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these. I am surprised that they are still on the market."
583,583,583,584,5,"Only 5mg sodium per serving, chips are crisp.  I sometimes will dip in a low salt ketchup and that adds a bit to the flavor."
584,584,584,585,5,"I have found this product, Kettle Chips Unsalted to be fabulous.  I found them by accident on Amazon after hunting all over my local stores.  They are crisp and tasty without all of the salt."
585,585,585,586,4,"When I saw the Spicy Thai chips, I knew i had to try them. I love spicy and I love Thai food, so why not? First off, these chips are not super spicy. They actually taste sort of sweet at first, with many degrees of flavor. The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards. I'd say these are definitely a good, unique chip. But if you absolutely hate sweet chips, I'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet."
586,586,586,587,5,"Smiles... Thank you Lord, for I have found another healthy snack food that is unsalted, and tastes great. I almost gave up on finding a potato chip like this. The only thing i would ask Kettle to change is the texture. It's slightly hard/crunchy, but not a problem at all. I would just prefer it to be softer. Kettle if you do make that happen, please keep everything else the same. Thank you."
587,587,587,588,5,"These are my favorite, but they aren't for everybody. In a way, they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen, but with a kick. For me, how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger? They are a bit rich, so they aren't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking. Because this is a case purchase, I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case. The 2oz size seems to be no longer available, which is a shame; I can eat the entire 5oz bag."
588,588,588,589,5,Salt & vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so I think I've tried every brand out there.  These are by far the best.  I also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy.  They seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste.
589,589,589,590,5,"Package arrived DOUBLE boxed, wrapped, and the inside box(that holds the goods) perfect not a single dent or rough mark, outstanding packaging.<br /><br />The Product?<br /><br />These are the best chips on the planet, Salt 'N Vinegar flavor is beyond among the best chips I've ever had. You might, actually I'm sure you probably won't like it AT FIRST BITE 'IF' you have never had these before. But try it again.<br /><br />Not to mention, this particular flavor has held up in numerous surveys and comparisons against other manufactures."
590,590,590,591,5,If you love jalapeno chips then Kettle is a must try.<br />Nice and cruncy with the kick of jalapeno.<br />Delicious.<br />Addicting.<br />Recommended.
591,591,591,592,4,"My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.<br /><br />First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.<br /><br />Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.<br /><br />Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.<br /><br />All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . ."
592,592,592,593,5,"After looking at the pictures someone put on here showing a crushed box, I had to write a review.  I have bought these chips numerous times from Amazon Warehouse Deals and each time they came packaged perfectly.  There was a sale at the end of the summer and I received a few cases/boxes for just over $10.00.  The chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag.  I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didn't eat them all.  As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok.  Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon.  Thanks for a great tasting product, good price and quick shipping.  I'll buy these again...soon."
593,593,593,594,2,"There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again. The ""best by"" date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October."
594,594,594,595,3,"I love this sea salt & vinegar flavor from Kettle.  When I saw this one on the daily deal here for $17.99/case, I put my order without doubt.  However, when I received the case, I found out that the whole case is expiring in December while I got it at the end of August.  I tried one package and I can definitely taste the unfreshness in the chips.  I was disappointed and then I found out this item is not returnable!  How convenient!  Although I love this chips, I won't order from here again with the concern of close expiration date..."
595,595,595,596,5,"This is the second purchase of Kettle Potato Chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them. We bought them by the a carton of 24 bags. The Kettle chips were in a 2oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal. The chips are so delicious, baked not fried and lightly salted with Sea Salt. They have 0 fat, no preservatives, nothing artificial and they only use real food ingredients. What more could you ask for in a great tasting chip!"
596,596,596,597,5,"How to achieve potato chip nirvana? It's simple:  Buy these chips, get them tomorrow, eat them!<br />Repeat.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Best ""old school"" BBQ flavor out there<br />Kettle quality<br />Incredible price with Amazon<br /><br />Did I mention delicious and a terrific bargain?"
597,597,597,598,5,"I found these more than 10 years ago in a health food store. After I bought one bag I found myself stopping by that store once a week to get these chips. The New York Cheddar flavor is so good, you will have a hard time not eating a whole bag."
598,598,598,599,5,But you will enjoy ever step. I gained 5 lbs within a month of buying this 12 pack of full sized bags. Damn it! They should warn you about this! Tastes awesome though. When I finish my crash diet I will order another box (case?). :-)
599,599,599,600,5,"These are the best spicy chips I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  They start off sweet, then as you eat more the spice builds up.  They are fantastic.  If you don't want to commit to a whole case, pick up a bag at your local Whole Foods first, then stock up here when you realize how amazing they are.  Got my case right here, and loving every bite.  On a side note, this brand (Kettle Brand) has many delicious varieties- this is just my personal favorite.  I also highly recommend: Backyard BBQ, Honey Dijon, Sweet Onion, Buffalo Bleu, Salt and Pepper and Death Valley Chipotle.  Lays aint got nothin on Kettle Brand!!!"
600,600,600,601,5,"I've eaten other brands of unsalted potato chips and they've always been terrible.  I didn't expect much when I bought these.  But after I tasted them I was amazed.  I have never enjoyed unsalted potato chips before these.  They have a natural potato flavor with thick, crunchy chips.  The only bad thing is the bag is a pain to open.  Use scissors and save yourself the aggravation."
601,601,601,602,5,"Kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips I've tasted thus far. They are thick, has a bite to them and I love their creative flavors. My favorite Kettle chip happens to be the honey Dijon. I think it's a great combination sweet, salty and tangy, perfect for one of those snack attacks when you don't know exactly what you want. I especially love the curled up chips for extra texture and crunch. These 2-oz bags are perfect for anyone who has a problem controlling portions (like me!)."

604,604,604,605,5,"Kettle chips are thicker and crunchier (though greasier at times) than other chips, and the honey dijon flavor is great.  They don't have the overwhelming salty taste some cheaper chips have, and the 2oz size is great for an adult size snack."
605,605,605,606,5,"I've always liked Salt and Vinegar chips but most of the time the stronger flavor was at the bottom of the bag. Not with these, the vinegar is overflowing right from the first chip and doesnt stop until you've finished the bag. These are very addictive. If you like salt and vinegar, these are the ultimate chips. Nothing else compares."
606,606,606,607,5,"Tasted good. Spicy. Those that don't like spicy should stay away from this. For the price paid, very good buy."
607,607,607,608,4,"These are seriously delicious, especially if you like plain potato chips. My only concern is they're very oily. I understand they're ""kettle chips"" and they're ""fried"" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!"
608,608,608,609,5,"This bags are very difficult to open with the aid of some tool, such as scissors, don't even try without scissors.<br /><br />They are crispy and taste like chips that aren't advertised as being salted. They definitely aren't healthy, because I can feel the grease all over my fingers when eating them, and I can see the grease at the bottom of the bag, too.<br /><br />They are high-quality chips, and deserve to be put on your table."
609,609,609,610,5,"Kettle Foods, Inc. makes the best tasting potato chips I've ever eaten.  With a variety of flavors, from classic Barbeque to their unique Spicy Thai you'll find the right flavor for your mouth. And not only do they taste wonderful, but these all-natural chips are cooked in safflower or sunflower oil for zero cholesterol.<br /><br />But why is it a GoGreenMart&More product of the week?

610,610,610,611,5,These really are amazing chips. Don't be put off by one of the cheeses being blue cheese...it is so subtle that even blue cheese haters (like me)will enjoy these.
611,611,611,612,4,"These chips are delectably delicious. I am on a low sodium diet. I didn't have to give up totally something that I truely love to snack. These chips are bursting with flavor, and you can't really tell they are missing all that salt. There is just a kiss worth on a chip, but beleive me, it is a total makeout!!!"

When you just gotta have some chips, Kettle Chips Lightly Salted chips are the what you've been searching for.<br /><br />There's no cholesterol, no trans fats, no artificial anything -- and because of the manufacturing process, they actually seem to have kind of a home-made quality.<br /><br />This is an excellent product!"
613,613,613,614,5,"I agree with the company motto ""A Natural Obsession"".  I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent.  The flavor of these is very strong, so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor, like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread.  Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food."
614,614,614,615,5,"The New York Cheddar flavor is my favorite of all the Kettle Brand potato chips. These are flavorful and crunchy and will make your mouth happy. Unfortunately, it may do the opposite to your backside, so don't do what my mom did and eat an entire bag on an empty stomach or you may spend the afternoon in the bathroom.<br /><br />I still give it a 5 of 5 stars.<br /><br />Also, the online price at Amazon is better than anywhere else I've seen them. Combined with Amazon Prime you'll be getting a great deal on these chips."
615,615,615,616,4,These are my new favorite!  I have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one!  They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these.<br /><br />Price wise...I do not see that they are that much of a deal here.  I purchased them for $2.99 at the grocery with no shipping.  I would have given the product 5 stars (easily) had it not been for the price.  The taste is fabulous -- you won't be disappointed.
616,616,616,617,5,These chips were good. I ended up eating a whole bag a day for a while cause they were so good. I am glad that they do not have any dextrose in them like lays do.
617,617,617,618,5,these are the best chips out there.. nothing can beat this taste. if you like honey mustard then you will definitely like this.. once you eat it you wont stop..addicting stuff
618,618,618,619,3,I dont know if they were fresh or if they were supposed to taste like they did. I checked the expiration date it was current but still tasted kind of stale to me !!!
619,619,619,620,5,"At first I was thinking, ""cheese flavored chips?""  But I love them.  The herbs they used are just delicious.  The cheese is not overpowering.  They are yummy and crispy!!"
620,620,620,621,2,"The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed ""ginger with attitude"" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  ""Great Taste Naturally"" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!"
621,621,621,622,1,"I Was sent 3 week past ""Fresh by date"" stock. Chips are noticeably not fresh in taste. Won't order again.<br /><br />EDIT: And just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it, black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat. unfortunately I put a chip in my mouth before I saw the hole.<br /><br />Very bad form amazon."
622,622,622,623,5,"I try to be good, but when I feel like indulging in some delicious, gourmet potato chips, these New York Chedder potato chips are the first flavor I like to go for, when I see them at the natural food store.  The chips are tangy and crunchy and satisfy your potato chip fix like no other brand."
623,623,623,624,1,"and THAT is  the problem. I order these by the case of 12 - and when they are good, which is over half the time they are the BEST kettle chip, THE BEST! and then I get a case of the worse - the potatos are mealy and old so I just throw them out and order again, expensive BUT when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best - the last case is what prompted me to write this - the potatos were weird - like they were almost sour as in going bad - and I even wrote the company that makes them - SO if you want the BEST kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are NOT the best try again!<br />I, myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring."
624,624,624,625,4,"I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle.  I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that.  Anyways, my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price.  I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price.  You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.  I recommend these, 4 stars."
625,625,625,626,5,"We've long enjoyed this brand of chip, so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these.<br /><br />  Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I'm a confirmed salt-aholic, generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans.  I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot.<br /><br />  How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt."
626,626,626,627,4,"For those who love salt and vinegar potato chips, this is the one to choose. The flavor is zippy and tart, with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less ""natural"" versions of this snack. The 2-ounce bags are just right to share at lunch. The chips are a little greasy, and that's why I've given them 4 stars instead of 5."
627,627,627,628,5,"Kettle lightly slated chips are my favorite on the market. I don't care for the ""fancy"" flavors and these are salted just right. Thick, super crunchy and full of flavor, they are the best!"
628,628,628,629,3,"These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a ""low salt"" item.  They seem as salty as any ""regular"" potato chip, and they also seem excessively greasy.  By comparison, Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy."
629,629,629,630,5,"Fantastic tasting potato chips. I love the individual bags, great for kids and adults too. No trans fat, no cholesterol, no artifical stuff.<br />Low in sodium and high in potassium, which is great for people like me with HBP.<br />Only problem is Amazon is out of stock some times and price is high."
630,630,630,631,4,"The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!"
631,631,631,632,5,My 8 yo is a Kettle chip addict so I was so happy to find snack size bags for his lunch!!! Great quality and much cheaper than in the stores!!! Will definitely be buying more!
632,632,632,633,3,"Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes ""too much"". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.<br /><br />AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are ""Krinkle Cut"" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.<br /><br />These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems."
633,633,633,634,5,"This may sound rediculous, but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle-brand jalapeno chips.  At the time I placed my order, I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag.  But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips.  Imho, Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip 'affection-ados'.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />  § homiedog §"
634,634,634,635,3,Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available.  I'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie's are better IMHO.
635,635,635,636,3,"I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though."
636,636,636,637,4,I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.
637,637,637,638,4,"This kettle chips taste ""Good , Crispy & Crunchy "" too ! U will enjoy it also! Moreover,it's thinly cut & sliced!"
638,638,638,639,5,I knew my family already liked these chips so it was a no brainer to take advantage of a great price for good chips.  The price per bag can't be beat if you order with subscribe and save and the good thing is you can always change the delivery interval if you notice you go through them quicker or slower than you anticipated.
639,639,639,640,5,"This is a delicious tea!<br /><br />I'm just now becoming a tea geek and really exploring the stuff I like, and Earl Grey is amongst the top, especially with bergamot.<br /><br />The problem I find is the amount of bergamot added is usually too little, or too much.<br /><br />This one is perfect! I really like the balance in the flavor. I don't add anything to this tea, just a part of a teaspoon in a cup and in 2-3 minutes it's ready.<br /><br />Tastes like an expensive tea but priced like Lipton. Definitely recommend it for fans of Earl Grey with a kick!"
640,640,640,641,5,"I bought this tea as an alternative to very pricey Teavana Black Teas. I have a cup every morning, very smooth refreshing tea."
641,641,641,642,5,The tea tin is guarding the aroma very well.<br />The taste is beautiful: the Malva flowers do soften the taste and the amount of bergamot is just right.<br />The first time I used too much tea and soaked it for too long (I used as reference Darjeeling FTGFOP First Flush).<br />Since then I save on the quantity of tea leaves and soak the tea for only two minutes.<br />A delight: the best Earl Grey I ever had. The price is very competitive.
642,642,642,643,5,"Pros:<br />- Extremely fragrant<br />- Full bodied<br />- Can be steeped twice<br />- Nice air-tight container<br />- Organic<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Price<br /><br />The Tao of Tea, Blue Flower Earl Grey Black Tea is the best Earl Grey I have ever tasted, and I would recommend it to anyone.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPFGO"">The Tao of Tea, Blue Flower Earl Grey Black Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a>"
643,643,643,644,5,"After a lifetime of tea drinking, I can honestly say that this is the best Earl Grey I have ever tasted.  I have ordered it a number of times, and each batch is consistently excellent. I have even given it as a gift, as its container is superb for keeping loose tea fresh.  The metal canister has an inner lid that is lifted with its own attached knob, so the tea stays dry and fresh for the length of time it takes to use it up.  Do yourself a favor, if you like Earl Grey, and treat yourself to this tea."
644,644,644,645,5,"These biscuits are delicious, not too sweet, with just enough crunch.  We love them.  Quick delivery. We would order them again.  Very satisfied."
645,645,645,646,5,"Excellent, lo-fat, lo- calorie treat for dogs. I have a German Shorthair Pointer-and these treats are her favorite( the organic peanut butter cookies are for smaller dogs, but she loves them-and for weight-control I like them!)"
646,646,646,647,5,"My male Maltese dog had been enjoying the Old Roy's Puppy Biscuits from Walmart.  Then I couldn't find them.  I was desperate to find a treat that would measure up.  I ordered six bags of the peanut butter and crossed my fingers.<br /><br />They arrived, and my little guy loves them.  He gets one heart-shaped biscuit at bedtime.  He sleeps in a crate.  When he hears me touch the bag of treats, he beats a path to his crate in high excitement.  They are a BIG hit with my him.  They are well worth the price.  They are high quality and I can even smell peanuts in them."
647,647,647,648,5,This product does a great job of clearing out the kidneys.  It has helped make my husband feel lots better even though he is in early renal failure.
648,648,648,649,5,"Love this with a bag of shrimp 3/4 pound, some stir fry veges and a little onion chopped. Not too hot but very tasty."
649,649,649,650,4,"So I got this and tasted it strait out of the bottle, it tasted like smoky flavored milk - YUCK! I was depressed I was stuck with 4 bottles of this.  It sat on my shelf and I forgot about it. Last weekend I tasted a Zevia cream soda and was not pleased with the flavor, it tasted weird and smokey like the LorAnn oil I had gotten.  I tried to doctor up the soda with a little SF Vanilla Torani syrup and a tablespoon of heavy cream - IT TASTED AMAZING!!!  The odd smokiness was gone and it had a wonderful rich mouthfeel.<br /><br />So I wanted to see if this would help the LorAnn oil too.  I put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it, it tasted fine.  Then I added ONE DROP of the oil, it is very strong, and stirred it in - IT TASTED SO MUCH BETTER!  I whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treat.<br /><br />Now I will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream.  It was such a happy accident to find out how to use it.  When added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in cream.<br /><br />It is VERY potent so only use a drop and increase after tasting, if you add too much it will ruin the recipe so use a light touch."
650,650,650,651,5,"We make up a coffee creamer with 1/4 part commercial coffee creamer, vanilla, butter creme, almond and Bavarian Creme flavors and the rest milk.  It tastes wonderful and is half the price of store-bought!<br /><br />It is excellent!"
651,651,651,652,5,"I'm from Detroit, and I was raised on Vernor's ginger ale.  Once I moved to California, though, I found it difficult to find Vernor's.  It would pop up here and there, and then disappear.  I guess without advertising, it just never found a home.<br /><br />I prefer the plastic bottles, but the ideal size is the 16.9 oz (500 ml) or the one liter.  The problem with the two liter size is that it takes one person (me) too long to drink it, letting it go flat.<br /><br />In any case, Vernor's is unique in that it is aged in oak for three years, I think.  That imparts a great, unique flavor.<br /><br />I wish it would catch on again, and become available more widely.<br /><br />(Recently I did see it on sale in Redwood City in California's Bay Area, south of San Francisco.  The next day, it was gone!"
652,652,652,653,5,"I like ""Vernor's"", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is ""The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now"" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans."
653,653,653,654,5,"If you want to find a good flavor substitute for maple syrup, barley malt, or brown rice syrup, this will do nicely. I use Madhava's agave nectar in my baked goods all the time, and am always pleased with the results. At the time I'm writing this, Amazon was out of stock as a vendor. However, when it was in stock, it was priced well for the 2-pack.<br /><br />Other than baking, I've used it to top waffles, pancakes, and in small doses (1/2 teaspoon) added it to oatmeal. A little goes a long way.<br /><br />Using agave nectar: Use 1/3 to 1/2 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener (depending on your taste and the recipe. Recipes with dried fruit need much less), cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F; if there is oil in the recipe, cut it by 1/3 (alternately, use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid -- just don't use too much or your recipe will be dry). Additionally, when baking, make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry. Most bakers might already know this, but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients (unless beaten with butter first).<br /><br />Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do, so you won't be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy. However, I highly recommend it for baking. It makes everything moister.<br /><br />If you are looking for less caramel flavor, you'll need to use the light version of this product (equally good in all applications)."
654,654,654,655,4,"Good quality nectar.  Very tasty.<br /><br />However, I was expecting 46 fluid ounces, not 46 ounces in weight.<br /><br />I find that 46 ounces in weight makes about 32 fluid ounces."
655,655,655,656,5,First time I've ever used Agave Nectar -- and it is great.  Keeps the blood sugar stable.  Great buy also!
656,656,656,657,5,"This sweetner is the best, it brings out the true flavors in what ever you add it to. And it has great health benefts."
657,657,657,658,5,I love this stuff.  It sweetens without affecting the blood glucose levels.  Now if I could only figure out how to make tequila I would be set.  Just kidding.
658,658,658,659,5,"I finally have found a natural sugar substitute that has the added benefit of having a low glycemic index. Agave is delicious! I have recommended it to many friends, and it is very economical to purchase the 46oz bottles."
659,659,659,660,4,"I used to buy the Wholesome Sweetners agave and like it a little better, but switched because it became too expensive. So this is the cheeper option. The taste is the same, but it seems a little less sweet because I find I have to use more of it to get the right sweetness in my coffee. I don't like the container. It doesn't pour well, so I have to pour it into a better squeeze bottle, so that I don't have a sticky mess on my counter every day. It's fine for the price. I continue to have it shipped to me every other month."
660,660,660,661,5,"I love using this to sweeten tea, coffee, etc. It tastes much better than other low glycemic sweeteners - there is no bitter aftertaste."
661,661,661,662,5,"I ordered this product two times now and have been very happy with both the delivery and the product.  It works great for cooking, baking and as a substitute sugar in my Chai lattes."
662,662,662,663,5,"I really like this product and taste great with the coffee or tea, and I have lost weight by cutting the sugar and replacing it with the honey and Agave nectar."
663,663,663,664,4,"We have been using 17-Day Diet guided by Low-Glycemic eating for about 6-7 months, with fair success. This amber agave nectar has become our primary sweetener because of the low glycemic effect on blood sugar. The taste is mellow,and the sweetening power is higher than sugar [so you use less], but without the ""twang"" of honey. the one thing I have not tried it on (still using sugar) is making kombucha - I still use sugar, as I'm not sure it would be a good idea to introduce a raw element into kombucha. But actually, that may just be my own over-caution and nothing related to actual chemistry or circumstance.<br /><br />Our primary uses are sweetening yogurt, using it in the little baking I do, and use in salad dressings, fruit desserts, etc. Because we are limiting our sweets consumption,we don't use a lot of this, but it's nice to have when we need it. I plan to try using it in some homemade jams later this season. I buy it on subscription, and the cost is about 33% less than the local WalMart and more than 50% less than the health food store on this same brand. ""Best by"" date on the bottles I received in May is 2015."
664,664,664,665,5,"I am so glad I was introduced the this brand of sweetner to replace sugar, this is so much better. I really like how it sweetens my herbal sweet teas without having to use too much, and how it can be used in place of pancake syrup too. Learning how to use it what the first thing I had to learn, once I learned how to use it, I became hooked. I would not even look at sugar any more. I highly reccomend if you want a clean fresh taste and feel to your foods.If you do purchase this sweetner, take advantage of ship and save, it will save you lots of money in the long run."
665,665,665,666,5,"I love this product! It is the best natural sweetener I have ever tried, and I have tried many. You can use also as pancake syrup or as a substitute for honey on your peanut butter and honey sandwich. It last a long time, and is a good value."
666,666,666,667,5,"I have been using Agave Nectar for several months now and have found it to be a staple in my home. Madhava Agave Nectar is good tasting, it was a good buy!"
667,667,667,668,5,"This stuff is great because it's low glycemic. Substitute this to sugar and you'll be doing your body a great favor.  This size is economical and shipping is fast, too.  I got mine very soon."
668,668,668,669,5,"Save a little money buying in larger quantities, as opposed to the smaller bottles. I like the taste of Agave, cross between honey/maple. Good for pies, cereal, frozen yogurt, etc."
669,669,669,670,5,"This is an awesome product which I've ordered many times.  Honey-like flavored, lower glycemic sweetener that's great in coffee or tea."
670,670,670,671,5,thank you for this product - we use it all the time and appreciate your promptness and the price was excellent.  Thanks again.
671,671,671,672,5,"I am on a low glycemic index diet to help control my blood sugar and hormone levels. My nutritionist recommended agave nectar as a sweetener since it's GI index is in the low 30's as opposed to honey in the low 50's and sugar in the mid-50's. I've tried supermarkets, health food stores and wholesale clubs. The prices are usually around $13 for a 32oz bottle and this is $19ish for 2x46oz. It's used like honey - substitute 2/3c for every 1c sugar and reduce liquids by 1/4th.<br /><br />I also use it in a carrot cake recipe (equal substitution) instead of sugar where I substitute whole wheat flour instead of white flour and I don't decrease the other liquids. It's delicious and you'd never know that's it's actually good for you."
672,672,672,673,1,I am very disappointed with this product because I could not see how many calories it has at the time I ordered it. I received it and now I can see it has 60 calories per tablespoon. Granulated sugar has only 45 calories per tablespoon. How could Agave Nectar be better than sugar?
673,673,673,674,5,"I was out to dinner with friends & family at ""The Saloon"" in ""Rte 46 Entertainment Complex"" in Sanford FL. Besides having an awesome staff (ask for Keith) and fabulous food (the escargot is a MUST) they serve China Mist tea. This is the 1st time I chose the Tropical Organic Green -- I have no doubt it is the best flavored tea I have ever had."
674,674,674,675,5,"If you've tried the conventional Kettle crinkle chip verson Salt and Peper, you CAN'T compare these to those!  These are easily some of the most spicy chips you will ever eat, but oompletely enjoyable.  You finish the bag and the indside is just coated with spices.  Great stuff."
675,675,675,676,5,"These are the best tasting tortilla chips I have ever had!  I have become allergic to tomatoes, but I love tortilla chips.  There is so much flavor in these chips that I no longer miss pico de gallo. I prefer to eat them plain. They also have just the right amount of heat to make them flovorful, but not overpoweringly spicy."
676,676,676,677,5,"These potato chips are DELICIOUS!  I have not had potato chips in approximately two years as it has been difficult to find organic chips.  Amazon lowered the price on these, and I finally had a chance to order them.  I most definitely will be ordering them again!  My family and I love them.  They are pure and void of all artificial flavorings.  The true flavor is present, and it satisifies the need for something salty, sweet, spicy, and crunchy.  A++++"
677,677,677,678,4,These chips are a great snack if you don't want all the junk assiciated with chips.  Try them you'll like them.
678,678,678,679,4,"I love these chips. The flavor is not plain. They are sweet and spicy all at the same time.  The only drawback is it has a tad bit too much salt. But, it still a great flavor!"
679,679,679,680,5,"thesedon't like hot food they might be a bit much for you. They have a great balance of sweetness and spice. Of course, Kettle Chips are just good chips - they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty. I also like that they are ridged chips - those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me - I don't want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness. If you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips."
680,680,680,681,5,Just the right amount of spice to make them hot and they are also sweet! Very hard to find in New Jersey. Can not have just one bag around!!
681,681,681,682,5,I can't believe how wonderful this chip is! The slightly spicy after taste gives the chip extra punch and flavor. My family and I are offically addicted.
682,682,682,683,4,"These chips are perfect for snacking with or without salsa. The texture is brittle and thin, like other Plocky's chips.<br /><br />The only downside: the spice is minimal."
683,683,683,684,4,I think Plocky's brand as a whole is a cut above in quality but I found these to lack in taste somewhat and be a little greasy.
684,684,684,685,5,"These are the best chips I have ever eaten. Everyone in our family loves them. Sweet but spicy- crispy....really good. Delivery was perfect, no crushed chips. Fantastic overall."
685,685,685,686,5,A nice case of chips that are quite tasty. I definitely enjoy the Kettle Sea Salt and Black Pepper. I just wish they were bigger bags :)
686,686,686,687,5,"I ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service. OH MY WORD! Spicy (but not burning spicy, more like tongue-warming), sweetish, salty...a really strongly-flavored and delicious chip. If you like barbecue flavor, this is a nice sweet-Mexi-fied barecue.<br /><br />I also like that it's organic.<br /><br />I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes. My bad. But dang, if they're not sinfully delicious.<br /><br />Granted, 5oz is not a whole lot (it was skimpy for the price, which is often the case when it comes to organic), but it was 750 calories at a pop. Geesh.<br /><br />Yes, 150 cals per 1 oz serving. That's about par for the course for fried chips.<br /><br />Verdict: Fattening, crispy, flavorful, delicious. Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low-fat sandwich or soup.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Mir"
687,687,687,688,5,"At first you think that these chips aren't all that Spicy, but the spice will grow on you with each bite.  They are really very good!"
688,688,688,689,5,"I can't say enough good things about Plocky's chips!!  I have purchased this flavor and the black bean flavor <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWKO7G"">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Black Beans 'N Rice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> and I love them!  They taste better than more well known brands and are very satisfying.  I have never eaten a tortilla chip that didn't make me feel guilty afterwards.  Not with Plocky's...I always eat less and feel satisfied.  I actually prefer these eaten by themselves..no dips...and I keep a bag in my desk at work.  I have even had them for lunch when there is no time to grab something.  I bring them to work to share with friends and they love them too.  I am a fan of Plocky's chips and will continue to purchase them on Amazon."
689,689,689,690,5,"My aunt gave me a bag of these and I was immediately addicted. There are actual pieces of beans in the chips and they are not overly salty like other chips. I love the zip, agreed they are awesome without salsa, and no trans fat!"
690,690,690,691,1,"I was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued Kettle flavor, but was disappointed when I opened the box and found this substitution. I am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor. It is a very good bbq chip but I could get this flavor at the grocery store. Why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued??? The one star is for the substitution. The country bbq is a 4 start chip, but not the chip I longed for."
691,691,691,692,5,"We love these chips. They can be eaten alone, since they are so crisp and tasty or with a dip. Every one that we have introduced the chips to, loves them. And the expiration date is for 8 months from now, so ordering 12 bags didn't come near to them going stale."
692,692,692,693,5,"I bought these chips, and wanted to try if they were tasty. It sure is!  Unique and different flavor and the right thickness.<br /><br />It remains crunchy, spicy and flavorful with a hint of tabasco and paprika sauce for heat. There are some rice granules embedded with the tortilla chips. However, some of the spices are lacking from this chip. But I liked this very much.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips. Go ahead-- you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese.  Maybe some el pastor, shredded meat, tomatoes, etcetera."
693,693,693,694,5,"I Love these chips for its unique taste and incredible crispy texture. Used to get them at Henry's in San Diego, CA before we moved out of there and have been ordering them from Amazon since. Running out of them constantly!"
694,694,694,695,4,These chips are the only ones I found to be tasty and healthy. They have fewer fat calories plus higher fiber for those who want good taste and nutrition--the perfect blend!
695,695,695,696,5,"We love these. Can't always get them in local stores, they don't keep them stocked even though we are always buying them out. Strong enough to dip in any condiment, great flavor and grain texture."
696,696,696,697,4,"These spicy chips have a lot of great flavor but be warned, you will be left with some stanky breath afterwards! The first time I ate these was at night and then even after brushing and flossing I could taste them in my mouth the next morning. So just be careful about when you eat them, especially if you will be hanging out with people later in the day."
697,697,697,698,5,"The first time I ate these chips was in Aruba in 2007.  I couldn't find them in our area (CT) so you can imagine my joy when I found them on Amazon.  I love these and hope you continue to carry them.  Your prices are terrific too.  I pay $2.99 in Aruba and they run about $2.46 a bag when I buy the case of 12 through Amazon.  Good job!!!!  Only problem is, now everybody wants them here and they steal my bags when the case comes in, but that's ok...sharing is good."
698,698,698,699,5,"These chips are delicious. If you like salt & pepper flavored chips with a solid crunch, then you can't go wrong with these--they are the tastiest bag I've come across. The sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt, in fact I have trouble cutting myself off mid-bag even though I normally enjoy a low sodium diet. I would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 8-9oz bags."
699,699,699,700,5,"I used to buy these at the local supermarket, but they are no longer carried there.  Finding them on Amazon I purchased a box and found they were fresh and delicious as I remembered.  For chips they are also very healthy.  I definately will buy them again."
700,700,700,701,5,Plocky's Red Beans and Rice Tortilla Chips are really tasty. I shared a few bags with my daughter in Iraq. She said Ummm they are Good. They are good for you too. No artificial stuff.
701,701,701,702,5,We like Plockys<br />They like us.<br />Plockys Plockys.<br />Mean no fuss.<br />Taste so good.<br />And healthy too.<br />Plockys Plockys.<br />Grab a bag or two.<br />Thank you Plockys!!
702,702,702,703,5,"I Love these potato chip they r soooo good! =) sweet and spicy but not overwhelming just enough to work up the palate, not salty just enough to balance out the sweetness I will be ordering these again soon. LOVe IT!"
703,703,703,704,5,The best potato chips I've ever had at the best price I've ever paid. The service was respectable and the shipping free.
704,704,704,705,5,I love this product.  All of the different flavors are fantastic.  My family likes the 3 grain the best.  No more corn tortilla chips in this house!
705,705,705,706,5,"Love these chips, and I don't even like black beans.  Very tasty.  Yum!!  Plus, good for you!"
706,706,706,707,5,These chips are FANFREAKINTASTIC. They are with out a doubt the best chips that I have ever had. A nice sweet smoky flavor and then a little bit-o-heat. OH YA BABY.
707,707,707,708,5,Nice amount of heat and smoke. Very tasty chip that goes great with a brew.
708,708,708,709,5,These chips are salty with a hint of sweet. They are crisp and crunchy. They are the best chips I've ever had!
709,709,709,710,5,"We ordered these only because the Black Beans and Rice,which we really. really love, was out of stock.  After about a week, we finally opened up a package and then kicked ourselves for not having tried them earlier.  There is a little kick to them after you swallow them to let you know you have had a hint of hot pepper of some sort.  We took them to a pot luck that night and came home with an empty bag.  I used them, from another bag, as a garnish on a salad that I took to the pot luck and we came home with an empty salad bowl!<br />We will definitely order these again.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWLUGU"">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Red Beans 'N Rice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>"
710,710,710,711,5,"I was first introduced to the Red Rice & Beans chips in my hometown of Bethlehem, PA.  When I moved to North Carolina I was unable to find these chips in my local area.  On my trips back home, I would buy a bunch of bags to bring back with me to NC.  Then I discovered that I could order them on-line and life was great.  These chips are my all time favorite and everyone that I serve them to loves them just the same.  You just gotta try them ... you'll be hooked !!!  ..... Nancy Walsh"
711,711,711,712,5,"Ok. If you don't want to get addicted, don't try Plocky's Red Beans and Rice Tortilla Chips! My husband and I started with one seemingly anodyne bag from a store. Now, we've just received our second case. It won't last long. Beware."
712,712,712,713,5,"My husband (who, being Mexican, is very picky about his tortilla chips) and I absolutely love these!  The texture is light and crispy, rather than thick and crunchy. He actually usually prefers a very hearty, cruncy chip (Like El Ranchero), but the flavor of these is so fantastic that we're both thilled with them. The bean, rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful, and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that. We go through an embarrassing amount of them.  I never, ever like plain chips, but these I can eat without anything else, although they're particularly amazing with a fresh salsa.  I highly recommend these!"
713,713,713,714,5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWLUGU"">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Red Beans 'N Rice, 7 Ounce Bag (Pack of 12)</a>  I first tasted these chips while visiting relatives in KY.  They are not available where I live, so I ordered them from Amazon.  WOW!  My friends and family are all addicted to them.  The spicy flavor grabs you at the first bite.  Once a bag is open, it is gone!"
714,714,714,715,5,We like these chips for salsa and quacomole better than any other cips on the market. They are even great by themselves. We will order these as long as they are available. Thank you for making them accessable.<br /><br />  Shelly Kenyon
715,715,715,716,2,"I guess there's no telling what will tickle the palate.  I'm a huge Tabasco fan, and I love unconventional snacks.  But these don't taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they're made from; I didn't find them to have much of a kick at all.  Practically bland, in fact.  Even with my strong aversion to wasting food, I had to throw out or give away most of the case.  Do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 12."
716,716,716,717,1,"""Yeast Extract"" is listed as an ingredient. Sounds harmless, right? Specifically, these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract, which is, on a chemical level, monosodium glutamate. It's just derived from a different source, but it has all the same toxic properties. Kettle still advertises their products as containing ""No MSG"" while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities."
717,717,717,718,3,"These were not flavorful enough for my taste. It seems that all the seasoning falls off the chips and sinks to the bottom of the bag. Too bad, because I really liked the idea of a healthier potato chip. I would not buy these again."
718,718,718,719,5,"Plocky's chips are made of several whole grains and have a touch of sweetness.  They are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips.  The flavor out performs any tortilla chip I have ever eaten.  They hold up great to salsas and dips.  Nothing wimpy about them.  I just wish the company made a bigger bag!  Love them.  Usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery, but seem to be difficult to obtain as the shelf is always empty.  Order by the case.  You'll be glad you did as they disappear fast."
719,719,719,720,4,I love these chips and ordered them after I had some in Florida.  My case of chips came without any packing inside.  All bags in a box with no cushioning at all.  Needless to say most of the chips were broken and I would not order them again.  A great item but if they can't package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money.
720,720,720,721,5,"I received this chips in a gift basket and absolutely loved them. I searched high and low, but was unable to find them until I saw them here. I immediately ordered a case. These chips are light, crispy, flavorful, and good for you. I love them with dip, in chili, or just plain. Once you try them, you'll be hooked!"
721,721,721,722,5,"These chips are truly amazing. They have it all. They're light, crisp, great tasting, nice texture, AND they're all natural... AND low in fat and sodium! Need I say more? I recently bought a bag of them at a regular grocery store, and couldn't belive my taste buds. That's why I excited why I saw them here on Amazon, and decided to buy a case!"
722,722,722,723,5,"These are the most fantastic chips I've ever had!  I could eat the whole bag myself!  They're made with lots of whole grain and beans, and make a complete protein, so I have no qualms about feeding them to my kids as snacks.  They are great!  The only problem I have with them:  The bag is too small!!!  We need a bigger bag!! :)"
723,723,723,724,2,"I did not like these potatoe chips. It's hot, and sweet, with an overwhelming taste of garlic. It's also a bit salty."
724,724,724,725,5,They did a very good job with shipping the order quickly....Nothing like Ace Hardware who took a week to ship
725,725,725,726,2,"Long story short - these are very tasty. We have purchased a number of flavors from this brand, this is my favorite.<br /><br />BUT... as noted by another reviewer - these contain MSG in the form of ""Yeast Extract"".<br /><br />It has become a popular means of hiding MSG lately by calling it different things, as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what I consume I find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersome.<br /><br />Also, the bag is not very large, but half of it is air. This may well help in shipping, but when paying a premium price for 'organic' it just seems more deceptive."
726,726,726,727,5,"Wonderful candy, hard to find.  I got a huge bag and put it in freezer.  It came shipped nicely in a sturdy box and heavy plastic. Just great!"
727,727,727,728,4,I bought thi9s for my dad for a surprise birthday present because he could not find them any where else!!
728,728,728,729,5,"So surprised to find the Taiwan-shaped pineapple cakes, they are so cute!<br />I've never found any pineapple cake like this at our local Asian supermarkets, so I ordered some from here. These lovely pastries made our Dragon Boat Festival party much more fun. My friends and I think it is a good idea to  order them again for our Mid-Autumn Festival party."
729,729,729,730,4,"I really like the pineapple shortcakes sold here. Unlike some of the mass-production pineapple shortcakes that use artificial flavoring, Tasselfield's pineapple shortcakes use real pineapples and it makes the whole world difference. You can even taste the fibers from pineapple.<br /><br />I opted for the traditional pineapple this time. I will be interested in trying out the Longan or mango variety next time."
730,730,730,731,5,"I purchased this 24 pack of Big Ass soda and only got 23. Immediately I was all like ""Oh man, this is gonna suck!"". Regardless of the quantity error though, it sure kicked some red.<br /><br />Everyone in my town absolutely loves it. I highly recommend along with other soda, Voltages.<br /><br />-Malcom"
731,731,731,732,5,"Well being the big red fan that I am, I bought some of this. First of all let me tell you the price is amazing, I mean where else can you get this type of deal in Saudi Arabia. Everyone in village loved it, of course now they are wondering when the next shipment will get it."
732,732,732,733,3,"Expiration date 1-13. Smashed and. stale. edible, not real enjoyable for the price I paid, One of the best pretzel's I had when<br />i purchased them from Publix. They stopped carrying them, I must find another addiction."
733,733,733,734,5,This cinnamon cake loaf has a wonderful natural flavor.  It's moist and tender and a great little sweet treat when you want something that isn't terribly bad for your diet.  It's delicious!
734,734,734,735,1,"Unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously, I neglected to not look for the word: ""supreme"" in this offer and since I was then receiving free shipping had 4 delivered. We (that is my husband, guests and me)knew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed. BUT, currently Amazon featured the ""supreme"" babka and now I am awaiting to receive these. In the future, I will read more carefully."
735,735,735,736,1,"I opened the can and immediately became concerned when I saw what looked like dried white crust, rather than fluffy frosting.  The package recommended stirring before use, so I gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous goo.  The best I can equate it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in ""Better of Dead"" (no raisins in it though!).<br />I tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous goo with white crusties in it.  When lifting the knife to spread it long strings on goo trailed from my knife.<br />I opted for making my own frosting instead - very easy!  A little Sprectrum palm shortening, a lot of powdered sugar, a tiny splash of vanilla, a tiny bit of salt, and rice milk as needed for consistency, beat for 5 minutes, and I had the fluffy 'butter' cream frosting I thought I'd get from Cherrybrook.<br /><br />I wonder if our can was overheated in the store (whole foods) or something...<br />I've read positive reviews of their frosting mix, so maybe I'll try that next time."
736,736,736,737,2,"Well, I opened it and it is grayish sticky mess. I'm so mad at myself for wasting my money, and not trying to make it from scratch at home. Which would probably end up better and cheaper. Oh well, live and learn!"
737,737,737,738,1,"I love Cherrybrook Kitchen and have tried almost all of their products.  I was excited to try the Ready to Spread frosting, as I do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting.  I am not a picky eater, especially if the item contains sugar... but this was horrible!  The consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting.  It is not light and fluffy.  It is very gooey.  I cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake - it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey.  I did not even try it on a cake, because the taste and texture were so off-putting.  Seriously, do not waste your money!"
738,738,738,739,1,"This product was such a disappointment!  As all the other reviewers said, it's a gluey, sticky texture more akin to Elmer's Glue than to an edible food product.  The flavor was sickening sweet.  I actually thought that the frosting had spoiled.  It was that bad!  Save yourself the time and $$ (I paid $4.99) and make your own frosting or go with another brand.  Cherrybrook cake and cookie mixes are so good.  It's hard to believe they even sell this."
739,739,739,740,1,"I am glad I found this on the reduced rack for 99c. The taste was not bad but no way I could frost my cake. It stuck to the knife,ran down in strings,what a mess. I too thought I had gotten a bad batch.My GDs birthday cake looks like crap. Who would buy this mess. Horrible"
740,740,740,741,1,"I recently purchased this on sale at my local grocery store... now I know why it was on sale!<br /><br />This is not a fluffy, creamy white frosting you'd expect to find when opening the jar. Now, I wasn't expecting it to be just like Betty Crocker, but it was pretty bad. Like others said, it is a gluey/tacky mess that would completely ruin a cake if you tried to spread it on.  It reminds me of taffy that hasn't quite hit the right stage in the candy making process.  The taste isn't that great either, and it's sickeningly sweet (even for frosting).  The only thing it might be used for is a frosting for cinnamon buns?  I still don't think it would be the right consistency..."
741,741,741,742,1,"I can honestly say this is the worst frosting we have ever bought. It's kind of generous to call it frosting, it has more the consistency of rubber cement. And since we were in a time crunch, we didn't have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting, so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it. Horrible experience, bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever. It spread about as easily as chewing gum, stuck to everything it came in contact with, and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it. On top of all this, it didn't even taste good. By the time we were done decorating, we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family. So we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre-made cake. Our cake, which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey, was used as a centerpiece. A really ugly centerpiece, that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried."
742,742,742,743,5,I work in college Financial Aid and keep a bowl of these on my desk for the students.  I used to buy them in the grocery store then learned I could get them for less online ($17 for 3lb bag) and thought that was a good deal - until I found this GREAT deal!
743,743,743,744,4,Well worth the money. I did the calculations on different bags and this dollar amount  is an excellent value. There are approx 2338 pops in the box. So far I've been through about half the box and have found about 3 without wrappers. That's pretty good considering. If you need 30lbs of dum-dums go for this product. Enjoy.
744,744,744,745,5,"This is pretty good canned meat. The sausage I used in dirty rice, the hamburger I used for taco salad, the chicken with wild rice, and the pork with stuffing. the turkey I gave to a neighbor because I don't eat it. The various meats are all pretty good quality and was enough for 3 large portions each can. There weren't large chunks of fat or gristle in any of the cans, which I've experienced plenty with some brands of canned meats. The proportion of liquids to meat was fair too, it's not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either, though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat. None of the meat was seasoned, at all. This is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring. There is a mild ""spam""-like texture and taste to the meats(but way better than spam any day), almost a brine or something, that's why I heavily seasoned it. Don't plan on frying anything in the fat from these meats, it gave everything a slightly rancid, soury taste...no idea why! Due to the higher calories and higher price, I will only stock this as emergency food. I will buy more for that reason."

My personal use is to add this to kombucha, maximizing it's longevity that way, I've tried many but this one is the best for kombucha. They say an 8oz glass has 2 servings of fruit on the Lakewood website. It's quite tasty in that it's not too sweet, very thick textured even with the tiny bits of seed in it reminiscent of a banana smoothie. The ingredient list is somewhat confusing but note that only the Acerola Cherry is from concentrate, everything else is fresh pressed. Acai is very high on the ORAC scale of anti-oxidants, Rose Hips are also very high, everything else is in the mid to high range of fruit. Pomegranate has many beneficial properties beyond just anti-oxidants as well, it's a noteworthy fighter of heart disease and Alzheimer's type dementia.

746,746,746,747,1,"A watered down perversion of the acai berry.<br /><br />This juice comes on strong and harsh.

Oh yeah there is some acai berry juice mixed into this concoction.<br /><br />You shall not find that distinctive  smooth chocolaty acai flavor here.  There is no milky mouth pleasing texture neither.  For that exotic unique acai experience try Zola or Samzon  brands.<br /><br />I'm not saying that this Lakewood juice product isn't nutritious.  That's not my point.  I'm saying that it's a juice blend that does not taste anything like the real acai juice."

751,751,751,752,4,"This is pretty good regular style soy sauce.  But it is not super-wonderful-better than any other good quality soy sauce you can buy in an Asian market.  The main value is as a unique gift.<br />  In the Japanese soy sauce world, there are 4 types: regular, mild (usukuchi), for raw fish (sashimi) and light colored.  Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style.  Compared to Kikoman (a good commercial brand that is widely available) Bluegrass starts saltier, is flat in the middle, then ends with a complex & interesting flavor.  Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round, full flavor in the middle.  Doesn't have the complex ending flavors.  For me, the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman's full middle flavor is a plus.  I prefere Kikoman, especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct.  But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor.  I haven't tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor, which is how soy sauce is usually used.<br />  Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce.  Each brand has a different flavor and everyone has their favorite.  If you want a unique Kentucky gift for an Asian friend, this is different than the standard bottle of Bourbon or box of chocolate."
752,752,752,753,5,"I watched an episode o ""How Things are Made"" on Discovery Channell and saw Bluegrass Soy Sauce featured.  On a whim, I ordered a bottle.  It took several weeks to arrive, but when it did - what a surprise.  My teenage son wanted to try it, and did.  He loved it immediately.  Now he puts it on many things. My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised and liked it very much.  In the past, I made many trips to the Far East and developed a real liking for Soy Sauce (where virtually all of it is made).  What a treat to find a handmade American product, that competes with (and wins), against a Japanese/Chinese national staple!"
753,753,753,754,5,"My bottle arrived just in time for a sushi dinner and game night planned with friends.  I had three soy sauces to choose from.  After some sampling we were all using the Bluegrass!  Everyone enjoyed the light smoothness a subtle sweetness.  We were splashing right on every piece, rather that dunking/dipping. Friends wanted to know where I found it. I'm going back to order more right now, and I'll be ordering 3 extra bottles because they are going to make a great little gift that's affordable and unique; instead of the traditional bottle of wine that so common it's boring."
754,754,754,755,5,If you enjoy the flavor of soy you will really like this.<br /><br />Plus its hand made in the good ole USA.
755,755,755,756,5,I recently acquired a bottle of this and was immediately impressed.  It has good flavor without all the excessive saltiness of supermarket brands.  I've used it for marinades and dipping sauces in addition to straight use and in all cases it has added a little something extra.  Quite a surprise to find an American made soy sauce that tastes this good!
756,756,756,757,5,"This soy sauce is the best we have ever had.  Thanks to Amazon, we were able to find it again.  It makes a big difference when using this product.  Thanks again"
757,757,757,758,5,This is the most delicious soy sauce I have ever tasted.  I will surely order it again.  Such deep flavor.
758,758,758,759,5,"Saw this on How it is made, which was a very interesting process.<br />Decided to give it a try, I really enjoy the flavor it adds.<br />Looking forward to trying it on several more dishes.<br />Thanks to those who brewed it!"
759,759,759,760,4,most soy sauce is from Japan but they are having problems with radiation in their soy bean fields. I am not sure how long the contamination will last. I like the idea this product claims no GMO seeds. yea  You pay more but decided not to take a chance on Japan.
760,760,760,761,5,"I'm pleased with these- wasn't sure how they'd be able to replicate the autumn classic flavors of caramel apples, but figured Werther's was a good bet.  I'm diabetic, so wolfing down a real caramel apple when the mood strikes just can't happen as often as I'd like to do so.  But these are tasty enough to get me through until I can 'carb budget'  the real thing. These are made with sugar alcohols, so it's wise to limit how many are eaten in a day unless you're going to be near home and have turbo-flush on your toilet.  (TMI???)  This pack of 6 will last a while, but they're definitely a 'will reorder'.  :)"
761,761,761,762,1,"This item, WERTHER'S SUGAR FREE HARD CANDY, if consumed, will give you - or your friends, loose bowels. I purchased 12 bags and discovered more than a bowel problem: You can't return them. Need a laxative? I have ten unopened bags you can have - for free."
762,762,762,763,5,"This is a bold blend that has a great taste. The flavor comes bursting through. I usually brew & drink Organic Sumatra Mandeling from BJ's. I use this blend exclusively, so to get a cup that rivals the complex flavor from my Tassimo brewer is fantastic. Come on Amazon add it to the subscription service."
763,763,763,764,5,"We've tried many Tassimo flavors.  This is by far our favorite.  Our normal cup of coffee is Starbuck's house blend out of a Cuisinart pot but one or two days a week we use our Tassimo.  This coffee is rich but not too stong.  I don't understand the current price over $20 for 14 disks and hope that it will be lowered on Amazon.  For now, we'll buy elsewhere."
764,764,764,765,5,"This is one of the best choices, in my opinion.  I also adore Amazon, but they need to negotiate a better price for their Tassimo Disks.  These are available at BedBath & Beyond for $10. and I always get 20% off which brings it down to $8.00 --- they were $7.50 (before the 20% off readily available coupons) until about 3 months ago.  Again, this is an excellent blend with full flavor - not bitter - I think it's my favorite."
765,765,765,766,4,"I have tried about 75% of the available T-Discs, and the Kona Blend is one of the best regular/unflavored coffees for Tassimo. It has a nice smooth flavor that is not overpowering, and has a pleasant aroma. Personally, I would enjoy it more if it were stronger/bolder. However, being a bit mild, it goes well with breakfast and/or (gluten-free) baked goodies. I find it mildly perplexing that this product is not available from tassimodirect, nor is a subscription service available. Originally found this at (Dead Bats from) Beyond, used a 20% coupon, and was happy with the final price."
766,766,766,767,3,"This coffee is good but, for me, it's nothing special. I will buy it again because it's a nice, mellow blend, and my favorite daily coffee, Nabob, must now be shipped from Canada. However, on my first order to the Canadian company, it's taking a long time to be delivered (still haven't gotten it).<br /><br />The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this ""Kona coffee"" is actually only 15% Kona. If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc, you can see that information, and there's a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description. So it's my fault for not reading more carefully, but I was happy to see what I thought was 100% Kona and wasn't careful. I've bought the 15% Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs, but I just read the product title and ordered.<br /><br />As I said, the coffee tastes good, the amount of coffee is the usual amount, neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size, and I would recommend the coffee. Just be aware that this is blended coffee with only 15% Kona. And don't expect it to come in a flash, as it did when Amazon Prime delivered it."
767,767,767,768,5,Of all the coffee's available for Tassimo this Kona has the richest flavor and fantastic aroma by<br />far my favorite.
768,768,768,769,5,I think these are my favorite cookies ever. Really light and creamy. Too bad you can no longer find them anywhere for less than two-hundred count! I don't think I need THAT many.
769,769,769,770,1,"This kind of tea not good ....!Taste and smell so wear it's not like tea ,and feel like some thing chemical."
770,770,770,771,4,"The Milka Naps Mix Gift Box is a fun, unique gift for those tired of Whitman's and the usual American brands. Nothing wrong with Whitman's, but sometimes a change of look and flavor is nice.<br /><br />As a sampler, it provides only a few of the Milka options. Four flavors are here: noisette, hazelnuts, alpine milk and strawberry. All are delicious, though I don't like strawberry/chocolate (in any candy) personally, and give those away to eager friends. The Naps box are perfect for coffee tables and as a standalone dish at work.<br /><br />Milka and its famous purple cow, is owned by Kraft, is an eastern European chocolate originally produced in Switzerland and is available in Germany, Austria, Hungary and other nearby countries.<br /><br />Distribution is still weak in the United States, but can be found increasingly in larger cities. Usually, then, it is found only in international grocery stores, though it pops up in eclectic grocers from time to time. It has been around 100 years. Whether or not Kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen. For now, the texture and taste are better than Hershey's and Nestle. It is a smoother, creamier basic chocolate.<br /><br />I fully recommend the Milka Naps Mix Gift Box.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com"
771,771,771,772,5,"I ordered for my dad for fathers day and he ate the whole box within two days.<br />He said it tasted really good, now I want to order some for myself, haha."
772,772,772,773,4,"Great candy and our family loved it.  It was smaller than I imagined it and I thought it was expensive for how small it was.  However, I am in Germany and can get it easier here.  The shipping to the USA makes it expenive.  Great product and fun for our USA family to receive."
773,773,773,774,5,"I eat mustard with everything, this is hands down THE BESt mustard I have ever tried, in fact everyone I tell to try some, falls in love with it as well. Spicy, tasty, real quality.<br />If you like spicy mustard, you will love this."
774,774,774,775,1,The laddoos turned bad in a few days after we received it. No other item inside our fridge turned bad.
775,775,775,776,5,This product works wonders if you have stomach issues.  I would buy again once I need more. :0)
776,776,776,777,3,Bought this at a local specialty-item store because I adore chutney.  Because of the higher price and being sold like a gourmet item I wrongly thought it would be better than the affordable brands sold at the supermarket.  Wrong.  It is mostly gel (jelly) with a few fruits sprinkled throughout and tastes like cheap thickened jelly you put on sandwiches...I've had much better and that's just talking about the supermarket brands.  Very disappointed.  Money does not buy quality.
777,777,777,778,5,"Our ferret loves this rabbit; it's a nice high protein treat in addition to his regular Evo ferret diet. The price was reasonable compared to our local pet store, which doesn't often have this item in stock."
778,778,778,779,5,"My son made this.  He didn't have the patience to be precise about the water temperature and when, half an hour before it was done, it appeared not to have risen at all--I feared for the worse.  Determined to be polite, I agreed to have a sandwich using the bread.  It was amazing.  Apparently it rises during the baking or something.<br /><br />Great tangy flavor (perfect for a meat sandwich imho) and not heavy at all.  Fortunately we had lots of deli meats, since the whole loaf disappeared within the hour.<br /><br />We've had all but the sourdough peasant bread so far; I'm sure that will be delicious as well."
779,779,779,780,5,"These were great - just as described. Used them for a bee-themed party, and now we use them as ""to go"" packs of honey for our coffee and tea."
780,780,780,781,1,This is NOT Disco Dust which is edible and made for baking. DO NOT purchase this product for such purposes!
781,781,781,782,3,I was very happy with the quick shipping as i needed it for a school product for my daughter but when it came in the roof was broken and the corner of the house was broken. I couldn't send it back as i needed for a project.
782,782,782,783,4,"Really easy project for family fun anytime not just for Christmas. Just put icing between cookies and stack. Then ice outside and decorate. Great for all ages.

783,783,783,784,4,My son is a SB fanatic so I was so excited to find this for the 2010 holiday season as every year we do some version of gingerbread. I knew by reading reviews that there wouldn't be enough yellow frosting so I whipped up so edible glue (water and confectionery sugar) to hold the levels of gingerbread that make the pineapple and save the yellow frosting for the outside - this worked great. It was a really fun idea that we enjoyed creating. The licorice was worthless though...
784,784,784,785,2,"this isn't as easy as it looks, doesn't came with enough yellow frosting, and the frosting doesn't stick very well. My 5 year old did like making it though."
785,785,785,786,1,"I am a preschool teacher and do a G is for Gingerbread unit every January. I was on vacation during Christmas and when I got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found. Which is odd. I needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week. I looked everywhere and could not find ont. So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday. I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme. The gingerbread itself came broken. Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken. It's non returnable. I called Amazon, they were nice enough to order me a second one since I spend a ton of money each year with them. This one also came broken. I order A LOT from Amazon and things do not come broken. I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100's of orders. But two of the same thing in a row?! I think it's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped. I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed. But it's bubble wrapped very well. I think the gingerbread isn't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off. The rest of the kit is very cute. The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box. But the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags. Too bad. But I would try something else, stay away from this one."
786,786,786,787,5,"I was pleasantly surprised to find this item had been delivered the day after my order, my speediest delivery to date. It probably helps my location is near. Everything looks just as described and pictured and I'm very happy to have done business with this seller. The Gingerbread house was carefully packaged as not to harm the fragile pieces inside. I'm excited to give this item as a gift."
787,787,787,788,4,"These cookies were fun to paint but not too tasty to eat!<br />The kids did not really care much, but it might have been<br />more fun if they could have eaten them.<br /><br />They really had fun coloring them!"
788,788,788,789,2,"I was disappointed in this product because I thought it would be bigger.<br />Also, it did not come with enough icing. I had to use my own."
789,789,789,790,2,"The whole idea of a Spongebob Ginger Bread Pineapple is really great, but the sticker that says ""Use By"" Has a 10 JN 16 date on it. If thats 2010- this is not good! I think it would be fun to make and a cute decoration, but my son is going to want to eat it.  The least the seller could do is to check the expiration date! Its right on the front of the box! Not happy at all!!!"
790,790,790,791,1,"This tea carries the flavor one would expect from the smell: terrible.  It invigorates like a puncture wound, and the only revival is that, after drinking, you discover that you are still alive.<br /><br />Well, one tea bag was enough for me.  My mother-in-law said, ""Oh, that smells kind of like wine.""  Okay, kind of like wine, with a hint of rot and a moldy aftertaste.  If she likes it, she can have the whole box."
791,791,791,792,1,"If it were possible to give this product zero stars, I would have done so.  I am a huge fan of Twinings teas, and was very excited to try this new blend.  After arriving home from the grocery, I immediately started the kettle to enjoy a cup while prepping dinner.  Between sorting, washing, and chopping items, the hot water was added to the bag to steep.  Preparation continued, until a distinctly off odor hit me.  I thought one of my ingredients must be rancid!  I hunted around for almost four minutes before I realized it was the tea.  Even after cleaning up, and airing out the kitchen, my roommate later came in and asked about the smell.  Save your money to purchase ANY other Twinings product."
792,792,792,793,4,"This tea is the best tea i've ever had. i first tasted it in norway, and had to find it in the states. i have it every morning."
793,793,793,794,5,"I love the aroma and the taste of the fruit and vanilla combo, and the addition of ginseng for an added energy boost rounds this tea out nicely for me. It's a sweet tea, which makes it a wonderful healthy alternative to desert after dinner.<br /><br />I see that others didn't like it, but it's really a matter of personal taste...different courses for different horses!"
794,794,794,795,5,"The best chocolate in the world, in this critic's humble opinion, is made in the United States. And the best chocolate in the United States is made in California, by the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. It is surely the best chocolate that one can find in so many stores, malls, etc. throughout the United States. Their actual stores are rare, but Kroger, Wal-Mart, Martin's (formerly Ukrops) and a long list of other grocery stores and many malls stock their products.<br /><br />I have never encountered milk chocolates with caramel filling to surpass the quality of these. These are chocolates deserving of poetry. You can eat them quickly, or take your time and savor every moment of eating every one. The choice is up to you."
795,795,795,796,5,This is a good quality brand of chocolate with many flavours of which this is just one. Very tasty and a fast delivery too
796,796,796,797,5,"My mother and father were the recipient of these wonderful pieces of chocolate heaven.  They didn't believe they deserved receiving these, but I know they did deserve to receive these!"
797,797,797,798,5,"This is the best caramel/chocolate combination I have ever tasted. The caramel is liquid and complements the Ghiradelli chocolate perfectly. Do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight - you will end up an addict like me.<br />  The Ghiradelli product is far better than the Caramello/Hershey product in every way. The Caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the Ghiradelli squares, and the Caramello caramel is harder and not as sublime in taste. Comparing the two is like comparing Warren Buffett to myself in terms of wealth. Unfortunately I am the Caramello bar in this regard.<br />  At the very least try the Ghiradelli."
798,798,798,799,3,"Of course, we all know how delicious Ghirardelli chocolate is!!!! Unfortunately, after I purchased two of these gift bags online, I found them in a local store for half the price. Lesson learned???!!!"
799,799,799,800,5,This chocolate treat is a great gift and it arrived right when I expected it to. I gave it to my girlfriend as a surprise gift and she absolutely loved it.
800,800,800,801,5,the first time i ordered this it came all melted but amazon was quick to remedy the situation by sending me another of the product and it was great thank you
801,801,801,802,3,Are people really paying 10 bucks for these chocolates??? ummmm go to any grocery store and by them for 2.98 a bag..wow
802,802,802,803,5,Low calorie and satisfying. These soups are a nice fill in when you don't want too much but don't want to be hungry for a few hours.
803,803,803,804,3,"This was really a disappointment. While the products included are fine, the real disappointment was the travel mug. It is a cheap plastic cup with the nutritional information for the cookies on it! So it is basically just a cookie package! Yeah, that is really what I want to use as a travel mug. I agree with the review that it looks like it came from a dollar store. The product description says the polka dot tumbler is ""definitely a keeper."" What? It is simply cheap packaging! Not something of quality to enjoy. Had I known that I would not have purchased the set. I really was looking forward to using the cute looking mug on a daily basis. I like the products inside and the basket is OK, but really this what not what it appeared to be."
804,804,804,805,3,"It looks pretty, but the contents are very minute and seem to not be of very high quality. There's a plastic cup for the tea that looks like it came from a dollar store. The basket is nice, though."
805,805,805,806,5,Purchased this as a gift for my mother when it was a lightning deal.  She was very happy and loved the basket.  She enjoyed the cookies and the flavors of tea that were included.  Shipped quick and arrived when expected.
806,806,806,807,5,"Received very quickly and extremely well packaged.  Since this is a smaller sized basket, it would be an adorable present for anyone who likes tea, for self or just to have to hand.  Very nicely assembled with attention to detail."
807,807,807,808,5,"These small chocolate cups are a specialty party item that I have never been able to find in the past when I wanted them.  Amazon now provides a link.  They can be used for what are commonly called ""jello shots,"" and provide a solid edible alternative to small paper cups."
808,808,808,809,5,I bought these chocolate liquor cups for a party! It was a big hit. They are high quality and a good buy.
809,809,809,810,5,Great for serving Chocolate liquor. Adds a touch of class to your event and elevates you to host supreme. Being able to eat the cup afterwards is just icing on the cake.
810,810,810,811,5,"Delicious chocolate cups, each in its own aluminum holder.  I could not find these in any local store, so was happy to find them on-line.<br />Most people are unaware of them, so they are impressed when I serve them a little cordial or other liquor in a chocolate cup.  After sipping the<br />liquor, you can eat the cup.  What could be nicer?  Excellent product."
811,811,811,812,5,The holiday liquor cups were exactly what I was looking for.  The chocolate is<br />delicious and holds up well to the liquors
812,812,812,813,4,"strawberry twist has a long-lasting pleasant flavor SWEET-but, not excessively so. delivery is timely and price is just right. Supieror to other TRIDENT flavors! Though, SPEARMINT isn't bad either. My next pick would be blueberry"
813,813,813,814,2,"Trident ""Strawberry Twist"" sugarless gum is very disappointing, both in taste and consistency. The strawberry flavor is very artificial tasting and, though I guess it is a good thing, not very long lasting. The gum also gets ""stringy"" fairly quickly.<br /><br />I chew a lot of gum, but will not be buying this flavor again.<br /><br />Not Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
814,814,814,815,3,"Besides that mentioned in the title, the only other remarks I have about it is the price is hard to beat, the taste is akin to a Flintstone strawberry vitamin (for those of you that have tasted them), and taste lasts for not very long.  I'd say, on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 lasting an extraordinary amount of time this would be a 3.  Also, the taste really diminishes to a subdued sweet after a very short amount of time."
815,815,815,816,5,I love this flavor and I cant find it on the shelves anymore. The gum tasted fresh which is actually way better than when I used to buy it in stores!
816,816,816,817,5,"If some other yahoo deems it ok to give give a suck review to this stuff because he doesn't like the taste, I feel I must assert that in this -as in all matters of taste- ""De Gustibus Non Disputandem Est"".<br /><br />I really love this gum. OK it doesn't really taste like strawberry, but it's still delicious. It has a wonderfully smooth consistency about halfway through, but then it gets tired, stuff, and squeaky.<br /><br />You'll forgive the squeaks perhaps when you find, as I did, that this stuff is a wonderful dietetic aid. By obsessively chewing this product I filled my gut with odorless room air and so helped me lose 25# in 3 months.<br /><br />Also, it doesn't lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight."
817,817,817,818,5,BEST DOG FOOD ON THE MARKET TODAY.  HAD NUMEROUS EAR PROBLEMS WITH OUR COCKER SPANIEL AND THEY HAVE CLEARED UP SINCE TAKING THIS FOOD.
818,818,818,819,5,"My father could no longer take care of his beloved 6 year old Cocker Spaniel, so I decided to take her into my family. When I brought her to NYC she had ear and eye discharge. She was also  slightly overweight. After a check up with a vet that ruled out infection, I decided to try Royal Canin based on the numerous good reviews.Within a week her ear and eye problems were gone and she dropped a good amount of weight. This is going to be the only food that we will be feeding her!"
819,819,819,820,5,"Our Spaniel has tried several foods in her 6 years, and this is the only one she will eat by itself without any ""people food"" being added (of course, we still treat her occasionally).  When we went in for our 12 month tooth-cleaning appointment, the vet told us to take her home as her teeth didn't need any cleaning for another 6 months, at least.  It is specially designed for their teeth and health needs, and she loves it.  And it is actually cheaper here than at the fancy pet store!  What more could you ask?"
820,820,820,821,5,"Royal Canin was recommended for my dog, but since this line of dog food is specific to breed, it was difficult to find in stores.  PetsMart and Petco carried the Cocker Spaniel formula but only in smaller bags which is much more expensive on a per ounce ratio.  Finding a larger bag has been a great deal.  My cocker loves the food too!"
821,821,821,822,5,This is food especially designed for Cocker spaniels who have a range of health issues...I have been using this product with three of my dogs and all of them are very happy with it. It also is packaged very well and as a result stays fresh for a long period of time. Great product!
822,822,822,823,5,"I tired many different dog foods over the 3 yrs I have my cocker spaniel. I then came upon this breed specific dog food & figured I'd try it. My dog loves this food and always finishes his food. I've used this for over 1 yr now & he has not tired of it. I have seen a significant change (for the better) in him, he's more active and doing well.<br /><br />I only buy this brand food for him now.<br /><br />Buster gives it 2 paws up & I give it 5 stars."
823,823,823,824,4,"I bought this for my one year old Cocker. However all the dogs love it. All their coats look better, they all shed less, eat less, use the bathroom less, my Cocker used to have this one chronic ear since the time I have had her as a puppy that it just gave her problems. It seems to have cleared up, no more smell. Her eyes give her less problems. And my 7yr old Yorkie he eats less, he used to throw up all the time had the most sensitive tummy. Our black lab mix, hot spots and she would just lick her fur off. All these great changes in a matter of a month.  I do mix it roughly 50/50 with Naturals dog food blend.  They are doing great.<br /><br />Sept 2012<br />I love this breed specific food, however I just went to place my next bi-monthly order and I am shocked at the price hike in just over a month!  I paid<br />$41.79 on Aug 3 for a 25lb bag and here it is Sept 20Th and the price has is now $53.94, a difference of $12.15 in price!  This is a huge amount to go up considering that I am assuming this is a price gouge; due to the speculation over crops :( I will look to my local vet for this product. I can get a large bag now less at Petco as well with the discounts they offer. They will order a larger bag if you ask."
824,824,824,825,5,"fast and great service, my Cavashon Loves this low fat dog food. Thanks. Arrived in great condition, thank you thank you thank you"
825,825,825,826,5,"We are Chocolate Moose & Mickey Moose,<br /><br />Our nice owner bought this great food for us.  We love it very much, I have gained 5 lbs. because I eat all of Mickey's food when he isn't looking!  Our skin and fur is much better now too.  :)"
826,826,826,827,5,My 7 year old Cocker Spaniel loves this food and it's good for him -- he needs to lose a few pounds and this is doing the trick.  Glad I found it on Amazon.  Hard to find elsewhere.
827,827,827,828,5,"My 50lb bag of oatmeal seemed like way too much, but as time went on I found more and more uses for it. I have so many recipes that I make weekly that I'm running out! This is a very high quality oatmeal and much cheaper and better than anything I've found in the grocery store."
828,828,828,829,5,"Better than organic oats advertised elsewhere. Takes lots of water. These are not minute oats, so my oatmeal cookies come out right, not all crumbly and soggy. (Instant oats have their place, but not in cookies)."
829,829,829,830,5,Honeyville Rolled Oats is a delicious product.  I am using them to make a product designed to increase and enrich the milk production in lactating mothers.<br />The oats were shipped to me in a timely fashion and the amazing thing is I only paid $4.99 shipping for 50lbs of oats!  I encourage anyone who likes oats to order Honeyville Rolled Oats.  Their flavor is above all the rest.
830,830,830,831,5,"Nice flavor, not too bitter.  We really like this coffee.  We have been searching for a coffee that pleases the whole family's tastes and this is the one."
831,831,831,832,1,The US made version of this Cadbury chocolate has a distinct taste from the UK version of the chocolate which I have been eating since childhood. I did not like this new taste. To all my friends from India -- buy this chocolate if it is either made in UK or India; otherwise you will be disappointed as I was.
832,832,832,833,1,"Cadbury chocolate uses a different formula in each country it is manufactured.  New Zealand is uses more cream than Australia, etc.  This version by Hershey is not what you expect from England, Australia or New Zealand Cadbury.  It does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differently.<br /><br />If you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non Hershey version.<br /><br />Hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality Cadbury chocolate to USA."
833,833,833,834,5,"My first taste of this tea saved my trip home from Santa Cruz, when both the hotel and a restaurant had stale powder in the tea bags.  How I needed my fix!  A tourist stop with a giant artichoke beckoned, and this Chinese Breakfast / Yunnan Black Tea set me straight.<br /><br />Other reviewers have said it tastes odd.  The flavor is strong and a bit smoky, like Darjeeling, only earthier.  Like Darjeeling or Earl Grey, it has enough flavor on its own -- no milk or sugar needed.  But it's expensive by the box of teabags.  Finding it loose in large quantities at this price is fantastic!  It arrived promptly, well-sealed, and true to the label -- unlike some ""loose"" tea that's actually cut up, this has the whole leaves that unfurl.  Ahhh."
834,834,834,835,5,This tea has surpassed all other breakfast teas in this tea-drinking household. We love it and it really starts the morning off right. Perhaps it has more caffeine than our old favorites?? The taste is wonderful without any additions and it will remain our tea of choice in the morning and often throughout the day.
835,835,835,836,5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL9X6"">Numi Organic Tea Chinese Breakfast Yunnan Black Tea, Loose Leaf, 16 oz bag (Pack of 2)</a>I brew iced tea in the refrigerator by the half-gallon with this tea. Excellent. The resealable bags work well, and unopened they protect my large stash, making it easier to manage my subscription."
836,836,836,837,3,"The taste is harsh as it is a lesser grade of Yunnan. It is ok to drink, but not to really enjoy. I only make it for when I am in the hurry and will not be able to fully enjoy my tea anyway."
837,837,837,838,5,"I've used maybe half a dozen bags of this tea in the last year and it is a delicious, consistently good quality black tea. Mainly I use it and several other Numi teas in my tea blends for making kombucha."
838,838,838,839,4,"I grew up on Yunnan tea as a child - it was always my mother's favorite - so I was happy to find an economical source of it of a quality that was great for a ""large volume"" habitual tea drinker like me. This tea is my daily regular tea. Yunnan is nice in that it will brew dark so you do not need much at a time. It's aromatic and flavorful without any additives. If you want something that is flowery yet more subtle than Earl Grey this Yunnan or a Keemun may be a nice option to explore."
839,839,839,840,5,"It always amazes me that there are not dozens of reviews here extolling the fine qualities of this tea.  I have drunk it pretty much every day for the last five years and I never get tired of it.  It's an excellent morning tea, is smooth without being insipid, and is almost impossible to ruin by oversteeping. Just use decent water.  I like a little stevia in it, as I'm a wimp. It brings out the natural sweetness of its malty, slightly floral style.  I just bought another two pounds."
840,840,840,841,5,I hardly ever write reviews but this tea is quite excellent.  I decided to try it without any sweetener or any other added taste enhancers.  It is flavorful without being overpowering.  It is a great pleasure to have a fine tea like this loose and reasonably priced.  After the first try I have continued to drink it just as it comes.  You can see by the leaves once they are soaked that it is a premium tea.
841,841,841,842,5,I read the other reviews before purchasing am pleased that I did. I have purchased other Numi teas and gave generally been happy with all of theri products.
842,842,842,843,3,"To my mind, a fine caramel should be creamy and melting.  These are grainy.  The flavor on these was fine, although a little sweet to my taste."
843,843,843,844,5,"Having eaten (and re-eaten) my way though all of the DAS caramel range, this remains my all-time favorite, and the one that usually gets the most rave reviews when I share them (which isn't an easy thing to do - just try one and you'll see what I mean).  I've been a caramel fan for ages, and while Werthers Butterscotch will do in a pinch, nothing has come closer to what my mother used to make than these.  They are chewy, buttery, and the little crunches of salt are spectacular (OK my mother didn't put salt in hers, this is an improvement)."
844,844,844,845,5,"Although I did enjoy the other flavor I ordered a tiny bit more, the Chocolate with walnuts one, this was still a very enjoyable flavor.  Wonderful service from Ms. Das, including a hand signed coupon for a discount on future orders, along with samples of a couple other caramel flavors.  I'd order this or the Chocolate and walnut flavor again for sure, along with more of Das Food's gourmet salt."
845,845,845,846,5,This is certainly the best caramels I have ever had.  I just wish it came in bigger pieces.  I finished the whole box in one sitting!  I will certainly buy them again.
846,846,846,847,1,"Not my idea of a good caramel.  Flavors of ginger and pistachio dominated.  Same for the chocolate walnut and orange honey varieties. I missed the mix of rich, buttery, dairy flavor with caramelized sugar that I expect in caramels."
847,847,847,848,4,being an old chemist with a spectrophotometer I am pleased when the chemical is what they say it is this is what they advertized
848,848,848,849,5,"This baking soda works great for cooking or for health reasons.  I take it for acid indigestion and heart burn.  Just a 1 tsp in a half glass of water and it's gone.  I use it to make my body more alkaline, so it's great for changing your pH level in your body!"
849,849,849,850,5,"I recently started using Bob's Red Mill Baking Soda.  I'm very pleased with it's performance and I can be sure that it is not contaminated with aluminum.  Thanks, Bob!"
850,850,850,851,3,"If you are concerned with an aluminum free product, then this is the product for you.  Too bad that baking SODA does not in any form contain aluminum.  This is, however a concern for baking POWDER which can, depending on manufacturer, contain aluminum.  Save your hard earned money and buy Bob's Red Mill regular baking soda.  Arm & Hammer is great for general cleaning purposes, but for natural beauty and health care, this brand is perfect.<br /><br />Just thought you'd all like to know. I almost fell for it myself until I did a little digging around. :)<br /><br />P.S- So as not to let all of amazon.com-land feel I am one of those ""haters who don't really know what they're talking about"", I LOVE Bob's Red Mill Co. and shall continue purchasing their excellent products."
851,851,851,852,5,"The product is of high quality, and has a rich full flavor.<br /><br />Delivery was unexpectedly fast.<br /><br />The only negative I would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack. While this may be commonplace, a significant improvement would be to have an inner liner of a heavy weight, food grade, plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag.  Could be either a zip-lock bag or a twist tie closure... doesn't make any difference... just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of it.<br /><br />This is a health and spoilage issue... 50#'s of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be repackaged by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers (very expensive and hard to find}. I am a single senior who likes to buy staple goods in bulk to save money and provide food security.  Long term storage is a big issue with people like me.<br /><br />Thom (Missouri)"
852,852,852,853,5,"I'm happy with the quality of the product and the price. Like the other reviewer, I would prefer if there was a plastic liner to preserve freshness. However, I will continue to buy this product regardless as it is quality oatmeal at a good price.<br /><br />Edit: I'm on my 4th bag, quality continues to be high."
853,853,853,854,5,"Product is fresh, good and I'm not getting complaints anymore.<br /><br />That's worth the large quantity and shipping charges.<br /><br />Hey, its oatmeal. My favorite!"
854,854,854,855,5,"Good quality oats. Package came on time. Oats worked well in recipes. I will admit, as a single person I bought these oats with my boyfriend for breakfast food- it lasted us for the year.<br /><br />Otherwise it's an excellent buy."
855,855,855,856,2,"I can't eat these oats, they have a funny taste to them.  My kids also think they taste funny.  My husband thinks they are OK, so he has 50 pounds of oats to eat on his own!"
856,856,856,857,4,"I looooove pocky, got once at lucky's and couldnt stop, its like the chocolate is laced with crack. anywho, the product is good, the only sad thing is that it was shipped or stored in a hot room and the chocolate melted together partially, but it didnt take too much effort to take apart the sticks.<br /><br />Great product, and great price from this merchant!"
857,857,857,858,5,"Of the many purchses I made on Amazon this past December, I was most pleased with the Pocky Chocolate Cream Covered Biscuit Sticks (Pack of 10). They arrived on time, and they were a 'hit' as a surprised gift. Be sure to keep them refridgerated."
858,858,858,859,5,"Got these for my kids as Christmas stocking stuffers.  They love them.  As far as delivery, the product came in good condition, timely, and was terrific.  Definitely a good buy."
859,859,859,860,5,"I'm not sure how you review something that's as subjective as taste, but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker, you'll like this (it doesn't taste exactly like either of those, but that's the closest analogy for me).  The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind, dipped in chocolate, with one end left just normal cracker to you don't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eating.<br /><br />Here's some of the nitty gritty details - each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets, that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks.  The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.<br /><br />Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.<br /><br />Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.  One note, if you live in a hot climate, don't order them in the summer because they will melt together (in shipping)!  Duh!  :)"
860,860,860,861,3,The chocolate on the stick was all melted and all the sticks were stuck with oneanother. The product and the concept is good but you will be better off buying it from a supermarket or directly get it from someone visiting Japan.
861,861,861,862,5,"First of all, I love the packaging making it heatproof but it wouldn't have been a problem because I ordered it it winter and they were freakishly cold. I also want to thank VeryAsia for the free sample of mi goreng...it was delicious!!! I now love mi goreng."
862,862,862,863,5,"I bought these back in January and never got around to reviewing them. I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out. Just like the description states, its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate. I wouldn't say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess, well, as long as the chocolate doesn't melt. Anyways, in case anyone is wondering, I ordered from a seller named Very asia (amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=0&orderID=103-7071944-5595443&marketplaceSeller=1&seller=A3JW437I54SEI1). I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me (maybe it had to be imported) but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. I'm definitely considering re-stocking on this in the future if I can't find a local store<br /><br />EDIT: Oct 11, 2012<br /><br />*****Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase*****<br /><br />So I decided to restock after I couldn't fight the craving anymore. Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good (ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime). What I received was not the picture shown on the front page (2 per pack japanese pocky), it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.<br /><br />Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a) not eat everything at once and b) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I won't be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I won't change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3. The taste isn't ""terrible"" but its definitely not to my liking. If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received."
863,863,863,864,5,Bought these for my daughter's Grad party as well as the Strawberry. She loves these things. They're a great product.
864,864,864,865,4,Everyone in our family except one really likes the taste of this.  It is addicting.  That includes our 3 year old.
865,865,865,866,5,"Pocky is just plain fun to eat. I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I'd heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.<br /><br />This is by no means a health food (it's in the same category as a cookie, it's got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it's junk food. We all know it's supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you're really prone to binge-eating or can't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn't recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.<br /><br />If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They're really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout 'caramel delights"" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).<br /><br />Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.<br /><br />However, with this crazy hot summer, I'd recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall's cooler weather. You might get a sticky, clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather. (Look for local stores that specialize in Japanese anime or manga and they'll likely carry Japanese snacks like these. In South Florida, Tate's Comics has them in a variety of flavors..and FRESH and NOT MELTED)."
866,866,866,867,5,"Pocky is an incredibly good snack, but more than that, I was impressed with Very Asia's packaging. I had stupidly ordered something as easy to melt as chocolate in the dead heat of summer. On top of that the package of dessert pocky I ordered in 100 degree weather melted into this liquid goo. T_T So of course I was expecting all the pocky in my 10 boxes to be melted away, but they took the special care to put the pocky in a box reading ""PROTECT FROM HEAT"" and my pocky arriving in perfect condition! (Well, they did stick together just a bit). I love Very Asia more than anything now."
867,867,867,868,2,"I think the Pocky did not get stored rightly. The chocolate was falling off from the biscuit stick, and doesn't taste as it should. Many of them stick together, and whenever I want to split them up, it just becomes very messy. Now I need to clean up my desk every time after I have it."
868,868,868,869,5,Everyone loves Pocky and if they say they don't they are lying lol. The Pocky arrived in good condition with minimal melting and very few broken pieces.
869,869,869,870,5,"These where great couldnt stop eating them.<br />Lowest priced anywhere and will buy even more next time.<br />Cant say enough about these, they where shipped faster than what I paid to have shipped also.<br />Thank you so much."
870,870,870,871,5,"I had bought Pocky when on vacation and enjoyed it but living where there are no Asian stores I have to shop on the internet. The guys in the family seem to like it better than the ladies for some reason. For a bit of insanity, search for Pocky commercials on youtube!"
871,871,871,872,2,The individual Pocky sticks are not separately packaged and melt and stick together while being shipped.
872,872,872,873,1,"This product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packaging award. The box only contains 5 bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal, so at least 50% of the interior of the box is air. Then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about 60% the length of a ""normal"" snack bar. The rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper. If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.<br /><br />As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor. Celiacs, who are used to inferior products, won't be disappointed in the taste of this one.<br /><br />I've also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging. The picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie. But when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter.<br /><br />I really want to like this company. They seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process. That is why I've continued to try their products. I bought their granola many times, always wanting to like it, but it is some of the worst food I've ever had. The ""clusters"" are hard as the partially popped kernels at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more fitting for gerbils than people.<br /><br />All in all I would not recommend Enjoy Life foods."
873,873,873,874,5,This was the first peanut free product I bought for my son.  I thought they were tasty.  The kids liked them too.  For some reason they think they are strawberry bars.  I love the soft texture and the non crumbly state.  It makes for clean car rides.  Since then they like the apple and chocolate bars the best.  Berry is always left for last.  Amazon has a wonderful price and I just wish it could be a subscribe item.
874,874,874,875,2,"I have recently stopped eating a number of allergens (dairy, soy, nuts) and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions.  Unfortunately, these were pretty gross - miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry.  I threw them away.  I would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free."
875,875,875,876,1,"My daughter had extensive food allergies as an infant/toddler and we bought these bars consistently.  She still has the nut and egg allergy so I like that I can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe.  Unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars (all varieties) they have been hard as a rock and my daughter won't eat them.  I have tried them myself and thought I might break a tooth. I had them on subscribe and save; which I have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat.  I agree with a previous post. I want to love these bars and I love everything the company stands for (and actually really like their cookies), but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing.  I hope they address the issue and I will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture. A total bummer -  they were better in the past but something changed with the taste, along with their new packaging!!"
876,876,876,877,5,My son with multiple food allergies really enjoys these bars.  I find that they have a good berry taste.  They also have a nice chewyness.
877,877,877,878,4,i love them. not too sweet but just right. any allergy free food is great in my book. hope non of these ingredients contains Corn...thats a no no for me too. HOWEVER I DONT APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT I OPENED MY NEW BOX AND THE CUT 1/4 OF IT OFF. IF THE SIZE IT LESS THEN SO SHOULD THE CHARGE. THIS WILL EFFECT MY DECISION IN BUYING AGAIN. I AM NOT A TODDLER I NEED A REAL SIZE BAR PLEASE
878,878,878,879,2,"I was extremely disappionted when I opened my shipment of Enjoy Life On The Go Bars (Very Berry, Carmel Apple, and Cocoa Loco). The boxes are now a plain, generic design..you know, the kind all brands change to when they want to make their products look cheaper. I then compared the ingredients of the new shipment with the older boxes I still had at home. Guess what?! Cheaper ingredients! Next, I taste-tested, and let my 3 year old help. He wouldn't eat the new ones...and I can't blame him. They are oily and bland. I thought Enjoy Life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a good-tasting product. I was wrong. In summary, these are way too expensive to be made with low-quality, unpalatable ingredients."
879,879,879,880,1,Refer to the picture I posted above.  The bar is half the size you think it is going to be...It is literally a two-bite bar.  Very deceptive advertising.  That and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star.  My 10 year old son ate one and didn't like them. I ate one and agreed as did my husband.  Couldn't give it away!  Everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as I'm concerned.
880,880,880,881,4,"With all the allergies in our family, these ended up working out great.  We don't have any negative reactions to the ingredients and though we don't buy many pre packaged foods, these work for 'on-the-go'. Our family tried several varieties and I prefer the Cocoa Loco Bars; they're almost like a Tootsie Roll to me-though I can't eat Tootsie Rolls, so this is a great substitute for that occasional craving.  My family prefers the Very Berry Bars because they can eat those when they miss breakfast, need a healthy snack, or my son will take them on his cross country running meets.  They are very dense and filling-not a 'soft bar' and we always eat them while having some liquid to drink at the same time."
881,881,881,882,4,"I'm new to food allergies.  My 6mo son was diagnosed with some severe FA and since he's still breastfed, I had to drastically alter my diet.<br /><br />Before learning about this brand, I was stuck eating chicken breasts with potatoes for every meal.  So when I stumbled upon this at my local Whole Foods, I was very excited to try it.<br /><br />Overall, I really like them.  It's got pretty good texture, taste and heft.  It's not so dense that you want to gag after two bites but also not so light that you can eat the whole box (which really isn't that big).<br /><br />I know alot of people complain about the size/packaging and I agree somewhat.  But each bar is an ounce and 120 calories... on par with many other breakfast bars.  I like the Berry flavor the best, it's the closest to real, non FA specialty flavor. Overally, I'm grateful for these bars because now I can tote several in my diaper bag and car and know that when I really need a quick snack, I won't be left stranded."
882,882,882,883,5,My son has severe allergies.  This is an item he loves and is a convenience for me.  I feel good giving them to him and they taste great!
883,883,883,884,4,"Tasty, convenient bars for people with celiac disease. They seem to have gotten smaller over time, but the taste and convenience outweigh the reduction in size (and the price)."
884,884,884,885,5,If you are looking for a great gluten free snack you won't be sorry you chose this product. My favorite flavor is the apple and nut.
885,885,885,886,4,"This brand of granola bars are really good.  The very berry are my favorite.  However, the bars are almost ridiculously small.  Yeah, we're gluten free, so our food is a lot more dense than other food, but honestly, can we not have normal sized, good tasting granola bars?  They really are tiny.  So, the taste is GREAT but the bar is small."
886,886,886,887,3,"They are OK, but my husband only eats them when we are in car. We keep them there for a celiac snack. (Hard to find when roaming around.) He won't eat them otherwise. They are definitely raspberry, but are kind of dry.<br />  We have never tried any other snack bars, so in all honesty they may be the norm. I don't know.<br />  We DO like Enjoy Life's other products.<br />  They are GF, have no MSG or related products or aspartates."
887,887,887,888,5,Great taste. Great ingredients. Great texture. Absolutely delicious! They are a little smaller and you may still be hungry if it is for a meal. I give one to my 5 year old son for breakfast and he is still a little hungry for more. Either that or they taste so good he wants more.
888,888,888,889,5,"Recently diagnosed a gluten-intolerant, I have been looking for products that allow me to resume a semblance of my former life. These snack bars fit the bill. They have the mouth-feel of a traditional snack bar, and a pleasant tart-sweet fruit flavor."
889,889,889,890,4,"My son Loves these ""fruit bars"" they are smaller than your typical wheat fruit bars.  My suggestion it to get your child to like these first before you try the chocolate ones... Now my son favors them (chocolate) ones MORE than the berry ones..."
890,890,890,891,5,"If you want a really good snack bar try these, they are healthy and taste as good as any granola bar, but without the gluten!! I buy these regularly."
891,891,891,892,1,"Imagine taking some kids' playground chalk, perhaps that tan colored one and grinding it into powder with plenty of chunks. Then scoop it up and put it in your mouth.<br /><br />That's how disgusting this bar is.<br /><br />I have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful, IT HAS NONE. I've done nutritional coaching for 30 years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellent.<br /><br />This neanderthal-era gluten free bar is so bad I want to go to my local grocery store, take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store (perhaps, if there's a trash compactor?) just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this product.<br /><br />Save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything else.<br /><br />""Enjoy Life"" bars? Being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth."
892,892,892,893,5,"My brother bought me a pound of this coffee for Christmas.  He told me that ""weaver"" was the original roaster for Pete's coffee, he eventually split off and started his own roaster.  Well let me tell you the stuff is delicious!  I've never been married to a brand of coffee, usually would buy the Starbucks 2.5 lb bag at Costco, or whatever looked good at Trader Joes, but Weavers is in a class of it's own.  I'm subscribing to guarantee I can have this stuff delivered to me regularly.  TRY IT!!"
893,893,893,894,5,"This is the best coffee we've ever had. A light taste but very full bodied. I was very pleased with the packaging, having it resealable keeps it stay fresher much longer and unlike other brands this construction stays intact. I must say you wont be displeased with your purchase, this is a must buy!"
894,894,894,895,5,This is the best coffee we've ever had.  I run The American Pavilion in Cannes and Weaver's was by far and  away our most popular coffee sponsor!  Hundreds of people come to The Pavilion every day looking for American coffee and they were not disappointed.  We did a booming business this year!  Buy it!  You'll be so happy you did!  Julie
895,895,895,896,4,"For those looking for a more exotic tea drinking experience and who like white Jasmine tea, Numi's Flower Jewel is worth a look. About the size of a gum-ball, these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.<br /><br />Decorative does not mean tasteless. As a white tea, the flavor is mild, but rich and soothing. The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. I have had stronger jasmine teas, but this one is quite balanced and tasty. I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade. The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and don't get bitter if seeped for long periods.<br /><br />I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart, though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact. Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf. Better packaging might solve this.<br /><br />If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells, or are entertaining and want a conversation piece, then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list."
896,896,896,897,2,"The first ball worked pretty well, it just looked a little beaten up.  Since then, ~half of these have fallen to pieces in hot water (all of them do after sitting for a bit).  If you don't mind the rate of failure, the tea itself is pretty good and fairly tolerant of being steeped for a long time (especially considering that it is white tea)."
897,897,897,898,4,"Numi has a winner here with this tea! My husband, son and I often share this wonderful tea after dinner. It is very pleasant and the reason they love it, it does not turn bitter after longer steeping, like other teas do!"
898,898,898,899,5,"The product is all that it says it is which is why I gave it 5 stars.  However, I do have issues with the product, namely, me and my family members can't take the smell.  The taste is horrible so I put it in a lotion cream and rubbed it on my skin.  This was a few weeks ago and though I've since changed my sheets, the scent is still in my bed.  Ultimately, I stopped using it because it made me smell in a way I did not like.  It smells like an Indian spice and while it didn't work for me, scent-wise, it may work fine with someone else."
899,899,899,900,3,"Both our twins love this one right from the start but it's not loaded with lentils (see ingredients below).  We introduced it when they were 7 months old and now they're 10 months.  I'm glad they are eating something green because we couldn't get them to eat the one with peas when we tried at 7 months, but we got them to eat the peas later at 9 months.<br /><br />Their favorite vegetable is sweet potato and we've also tried sweet potato with cinnamon. They love all the fruit varieties.<br /><br />I'm glad they love this one because lentils and brown rice form a complete protein, although a view of the ingredients shows that lentils is not one of the prime ingredients.<br /><br />This one also has carrots and I've heard all babies like carrots.  I don't know if they would like it without the carrots.  I haven't seen this one - lentils and brown rice - in our local stores, so I'm glad to get it here. Along with some others, we get this one with the subscription.  Of course, with twins one is forced to buy more in bulk and we're so busy that it's great to get these delivered.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent.  I've ordered an unbelievable number of cases of jars of different types and only had one jar arrive broken.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic brown rice, organic lentils, organic canola oil.<br /><br />This has 70 calories, 10% protein, 100% vitamin A, 4% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 4% iron.<br /><br />I'm informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult."
900,900,900,901,4,"My twin 10-month old babies treat this one as dessert.  Their first Earth's Best jar they loved was straight sweet potatoes.  After water, sweet potatoes are the first ingredient in this one, followed by apricot puree.  That's dessert for them right there.  After that comes the chicken and then brown rice flour (not as good as brown rice though).<br /><br />This is a meal that babies around the age of mine are probably almost all going to love instantly.  Almost all babies love sweet potatoes for starters.  Add apricot puree and there's really not much one could do to discourage babies after that.  I recommend this flavor brand.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic brown rice flour.<br /><br />The rice flour absorbed the water and gave it a real nice consistency, and the sweet potatoes gave it a nice color.<br /><br />Nutrition per label: 80 calories, 15% protein, 90% vitamin A, 2% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 6% iron.<br /><br />This one had the most vitamin A of all Earth's Best jars I've tried.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult."
901,901,901,902,3,"I liked getting this one for my twin 10-month olds because it has such interesting ingredients, particularly the zucchini and the garbanzo beans.  I like the fact that it's vegetarian yet I believe it has a complete protein since it also has brown rice.  This list of ingredients looks excellent and it's a green color naturally.<br /><br />The babies liked it.  They have liked everything that has carrots.<br /><br />I have the subscription for this one as I really like the ingredients and the fact that I'm giving the babies food that is naturally green.<br /><br />Ingredients per the label: Water, organic corn, organic zucchini, organic green beans, organic brown rice, organic carrots, organic garbanzo beans, organic canola oil.<br /><br />This has 70 calories, 8% protein, 40% vitamin A, 10% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 2% iron.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult."
902,902,902,903,4,"Baby loved this one, but as he has progressed I had to cut this one out because it is too runny and if I have to move the spoon quickly out of the way of his grabby hands, it is all over! I think they could use a little less water maybe a little more potato to make it more the consistency of the turkey dinner one."
903,903,903,904,3,"Earth's Best Turkey Vegetable Dinner hits the spot with apples with turkey. You can add cranberries if you want to take it to the next level.  I just can't find non-sweetened and non-dried cranberries even at the better food stores.<br /><br />Apples, carrots and turkey taste good to my 10-month old growing twin girls.  Babies love carrots since they're sweet to their taste, so that made a great addition.  The whole barley flour absorbs the water to give it an acceptable consistency.<br /><br />The ingredients per the label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, mechanically separated organic turkey, organic whole barley flour.<br /><br />In addition to 12% protein and 50% vitamin A, it has 6% calcium and 4% iron.<br /><br />I'm very pleased my babies like this food and are being introduced to so many foods through Earth's Best.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult."
904,904,904,905,5,"My little girl can't get enough of this! I like that it is organic and contains fruit, veggies, protein and grains in one tasty meal. I wish it came in larger portions since my 10 month old always wants 2 jars."
905,905,905,906,5,"Its my daughter's favorite first and foremost.  For me I love that i can get lentils, there aren't many stage 2 or 3 vegetarian choices."
906,906,906,907,1,"Wow, i am shocked to find clear plastic pieces in the jars. The other posters say they notified Earth's Best about this in August and they are still selling it without checking or recalling!! No more earth's best for my little guy. I am taking my business elsewhere and I am very sad that organic company is selling baby food with plastic and bpa in their jars. They gotta do better than this to get my business."
907,907,907,908,4,"I like the Earth's Best baby food line because of the organic ingredients. Amazon has great prices (especially if you subscribe) and free delivery to your doorstop, which is convenient when you're a busy mom. My daughter doesn't like a lot of baby foods, but will eat this one. As other reviewers have stated, it's a bit runnier that other EB's stage 2 foods, so I add some oatmeal to it. It's also a bit bland, so I add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up. As an added bonus, it works wonders for her digestive tract! She had problems with constipation for about 2.5 months, sometimes going up to 10 days before we had to give her a suppository, and then I discovered that this food makes her poop every time (I also started giving her a sippy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber). I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because the main ingredients are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken. I wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein."
908,908,908,909,5,"This is my son's favorite dinner! Best of all it seems it has the best combo of protein (21%) , vitamin A (100%) and C (30%). It is runnier than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it. Love love love this brand and flavor. I think I purchased 50 jars so far."
909,909,909,910,5,"I don't know how everyone else got these broken, but when I received them they came wrapped in plastic and in bubble wrap, not a single jar was broken.  My son loves them and the price was great and I had no issues at all."
910,910,910,911,3,Would be a quality product if it weren't so thin. Nearly the consistency of soup. It just makes too much of a mess no matter how careful you try to be.
911,911,911,912,5,"I would love to say that I have the time to make my son's food everyday. Its not the case. Honestly, I do make it most of the time, but some days, you just don't have the time/energy to get it all done. Enter this product. Before I bought this baby food, I read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it, its like a dessert, yadda yadda yadda. The truth is, is that yes, it has a bit of fruit in it, but its not sweet at all. The fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you don't have to add anything else. Its a great product to enter proteins into baby's diet. The consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal  to it also, baby will not choke on it. I highly recommend."
912,912,912,913,4,"We love earth's best organic baby food, but this is not the tastiest one. I've tried it myself and think it is pretty gross. But my daughter still eats it, just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors. It's got a decent amount of protein, which is important for us as a vegetarian family."
913,913,913,914,5,Soft smooth texture - my little one devours this one...it is one of the best meat/veg dinners we have found!
914,914,914,915,1,"My triplets will not eat this, eventhe one who will eat ANYTHING. The consistency is way too runny as well and does not stay on the spoon."
915,915,915,916,3,"My baby LOVES sweet potatoes. I can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them; which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what I wanted to mix in there... it was horribly runny, like spooning formula into his mouth. Ick."
916,916,916,917,4,"My daughter was not a big fan of baby food, especially any with proteins, but she did LOVE this one! The flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and doesn't have a strong chicken flavor. Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus it's a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters. My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferences.<br />Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth's Best, especially for having chicken. I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture, and she liked that just fine, but it is an extra step. However the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gagging/texture problems."
917,917,917,918,5,This is the only food my daughter will eat consistly. She really enjoys it. The packaging is great. Never had any broken (having ordered 4 times).
918,918,918,919,5,My son loves the rice and lentil jars.  It's not as liquid in consistency as the peas and brown rice jars.  I have it on order with subscribe and save + amazon mom and it always arrives nicely packaged.
919,919,919,920,5,"I have twin girls, they both loved the Vegetable Turkey Dinner.  It was one of their favorite baby foods.  Great price."
920,920,920,921,1,"I normally love Earth's Best products (as does my son). However, tonight after I'd given him half the jar I thought I would try some since it was a new flavor and I realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it. I was appalled!  As this is my first child and I don't have any experience with this kind of thing, I called poison control. They said he would be ok and once I knew he was fine, I got really angry. I looked it up online and found that Earth's Best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it. Don't buy Earth's Best! Really disappointing."
921,921,921,922,5,My son really enjoys Earth's Best lentil!  He eats the entire jar for dinner and always wants more.  The product shipped very quickly.
922,922,922,923,3,"I introduced my daughter to Earth's Best Organic Turkey Vegetable Dinner at 4 months. A bit early, but she's advanced, as she was 6 weeks overdue.  She loved it at first.  But, I bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite.  I've tried some of it as well.  Of all of them, this is also my least favorite."
923,923,923,924,3,"We received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today. I always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature (I put them in a bowl and microwave for 6-9 seconds) and taste ok. When I tasted this, I made a face because it was so yucky! I added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon. To her credit, my (8 month old) daughter ate some bites, but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors. I like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein."
924,924,924,925,5,I love the fact that there is turkey being offered. This is my son's 2nd favorite dish. No issues with it and a good balance of nutrients.
925,925,925,926,1,Only three jars came in a form edible to babies.  The rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water.  It also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixture.<br />Pretty disappointing and a waste of money.
926,926,926,927,5,"This is one of my son's favorite baby foods.  It does have a bit of sweetness, but not too sweet.  It's more runny than some of the other flavors, so we use a deeper spoon with this one, or add a little rice cereal to thicken it up."
927,927,927,928,4,"For whatever reason, our son really likes this flavor. I'm not a fan myself, but I'm not the one eating it. Any time I can get a variety of vegetables into my baby in one sitting, I'm a happy mom."
928,928,928,929,5,The Rice and Lentil dinner is our son's absolute favorite. I don't know why but he gobbles this up every time. He enjoys most of the Earth's Best foods and we have only found a couple he doesn't eat (anything with too much apple) which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination. Some of the varieties tend to be too runny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar.
929,929,929,930,4,"My 7-1/2 month old absolutely loves this one...by far, it is her favorite jarred baby food. I like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food, and I'm not ready to introduce her to meats yet.<br /><br />I do subscribe & save, which brings the price down to $0.80/jar. That's a fair price - not an amazing deal, but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store.  The bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find - I have to go to Whole Foods. My regular grocery store and Target carry Earth's Best, but not this blend. My daughter likes it so much, though, that I would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices. It's a good one!"
930,930,930,931,5,I always try the food before I feed it to my daughter and this one is actually pretty good. My daughter LOVES it. She gets all excited when I make it for her
931,931,931,932,5,"From 6 month to 12 month, my son barely ate any solid food.  He was so picky.  We tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that he'd actually finish the whole jar.  I didn't expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it, but I guessed it wrong.<br />Now he is 18 month old and he is a pretty healthy eater.  His current favorite seems to be tofu, but he still loves corn, zucchini, brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this.  I highly recommend to try this baby food.<br /><br />Also, Earth's Best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well.  My son doesn't really like any snacks from Gerber brand, but he likes most of the products from Earth's Best.  Their foods taste great(even for us adult) and so good for you too."
932,932,932,933,3,"Little Baby Picky will only eat this sometimes. This one is more watery than the others, so keep that in mind. Reviewing baby food is objective since all children are different, so I hope letting you know the consistency and texture help."
933,933,933,934,5,"This tastes so good that apparently our cat thinks so too -- he's constantly poking his furry face around every time we pop open one of these. There is absolutely nothing bad to say about these. I know some people have complained about the poor packaging but I believe that must've been fixed b/c I've not had any problems at all -- in fact, they securely bubble wrap these, then place them in an air-cushioned box and it all arrives perfectly every time."
934,934,934,935,5,"I have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review, but they like all the flavors, the textures are great, and the jars open easily. Great on the go snack."
935,935,935,936,5,"My son started eating this when he was around 8 months old; he's now 14 months old and it's one of his favorites. Unfortunately, they don't carry it at the local grocery store (they carry other varieties of Earth's Best; just not this one or his other favorites, Spinach/Potatoes and Spaghetti with Cheese); they do carry it at some of the Whole Foods so I buy them there. I'm so glad to find them on Amazon! I get TIRED of ringing up a gazillion little jars at the store.<br /><br />We use this as a base and mix in other things - bits of cooked broccoli, small pieces of meat. I've also started adding spices to introduce him to new flavors."
936,936,936,937,5,My baby loves Rice and Lentil and is one of her favorite things to eat.  If we are going somewhere I won't be able to warm the food she will eat this one cold.
937,937,937,938,5,My daughter loved this stuff. It is all natural and made very well.  Good to mix with other things as they get older too!  Beats Gerber.
938,938,938,939,5,"My daughter is outgrowing baby food but will still eat this.  We tried 3rd foods on her and she doesn't like the texture of them.  This is really good for her and she likes it, so we keep buying it."
939,939,939,940,5,My son loves the Best Earth's baby food and his favorite seems to be the Vegetable and Turkey. He smiles at every mouthful.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for healthy feeding the organic way. All the food I feed my son is through Earth's Best.
940,940,940,941,1,To be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible. Up all night screaming from gas pains. Garbanzo beans are not an ideal food for young babies.
941,941,941,942,2,"I usually make my baby's food.... it's so easy, steam fruits & veggies and puree.... but sometimes I don't have enough time to cook and I buy Earth's Best baby foods....baby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but didn't like this one. She refused to eat it. When I tried it I understood why, I wouldn't eat it myself either... it tastes nasty.... my poor baby.... immediately I made her a homemade potato, zucchini, & asparagus puree and she loved it. I wouldn't recommend this flavor!"
942,942,942,943,5,"My six month old baby loves the Earth's Best 2nd Sweet Potato Chicken Dinner - it's his favorite. He seems to love all the Earth's Best 2nd foods - fruits, vegetables, and dinners. The consistency of the food makes it easy for him to eat - not too thick, not too thin."
943,943,943,944,1,"This is my daughter's  most favorite baby food by far.  This is the only ones she'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds.  However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.<br />I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.  PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD? I notified Earth's Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing, but I am not giving my baby this food any more, even though she likes it, that's it for us."
944,944,944,945,5,"The earths best he eats the most, this one is a little thicker than his original chicken/sweet potato favorite which is very runny."
945,945,945,946,5,I'd continue to buy but I'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too.
946,946,946,947,4,I didn't eat any but my baby liked it. She said it was savory but sweet and it reminded her of fine dining in Tuscany. Also I like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste. I just learned this and am telling everyone - only glass recycles forever. And if you don't recycle then you and I have nothing in common and you should stop reading here. It's not even a hard thing to do anymore. Nobody else in my building recycles and it drives me crazy. You just rinse it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day. Stop being lazy.
947,947,947,948,1,I just wanted to post here that I found small bits of plastic in this food as I was feeding my 9 month old.  Plastic!!! in food!!!! baby food!!!  So please be careful if you buy this or are considering it.<br /><br />My daughter LOVES this food-- it's actually her favorite.  This is the first time we have noticed plastic in it in over 2 months.
948,948,948,949,4,Pretty good product.  The taste isn't the best but it's definitely not the worse either.  It gives a pretty smooth energetic kick.
949,949,949,950,5,"I am a true Seattle coffee addict, and I have never had a better coffee candy."
950,950,950,951,4,Sent this basket to my father for his birthday.  He said the fruit was very fresh and sweet.  Happy with this healthy purchase!
951,951,951,952,5,"This fruit gift really was the perfect gift! Everything was fresh, well packed and tasty looking! And the people that received it assured me that it was quite tasty tasting too. And tried the chocolate covered cherries ad was surprised at how delicious they were! So thank you! I needed something in a pinch and it came even earlier than expected!SO THANK YOU AGAIN! Dharana,San Francisco"
952,952,952,953,5,"I got it for my Girlfriend for her Birthday.  The Fruit actually tasted fresh and yummy!  I love dark chocolate, so I loved the dark chocolate almonds.  Next time I'll give the Organic version of this product... to someone close so they share with me  :)"
953,953,953,954,5,As a child my facorite memory was drinking Sassafras tea made from fresh sassafras with my Granddad. I have never seen it in a tea bag before. I found that to get the taste I remember I needed 2 bags per cup. The bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that I will buy again and again. Plus the shipping time was great.
954,954,954,955,4,"I grew up in Ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful. I would dig tender roots or ""bark"" a few trees for a delightful tea.  I purchased Breezy Morning Sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product.  Not a good bargain.  I switched to Pappy's extract."
955,955,955,956,4,I ordered this on-line and received it in just a few days (3).  The tea is excellent and the price was right for  me.
956,956,956,957,5,"I purchased this tea for my neighbor as a present, she has been looking for sassafras tea for a long time, I didn't realize it was so hard to find!  She absolutely loves it, made a great surprise christmas gift."
957,957,957,958,5,I heard some great things about Sassafras and wanted to try it.  I was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated.  I'm actually gonna order the 4-pack and continue drinking it over time.  Don't trust the FDA!!
958,958,958,959,5,"bought this for my dad. for about 2 years he would complain to be about how he hasn't had this tea since he was about 9. finally, after many nights of drinking my tea annoyed, i bought him the tea so he'd shut up."
959,959,959,960,1,"I first tasted Sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it.  So I started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form.  After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea.  I was told is was Pappy's Sassafras Concentrate.  I looked online and found it at Amazon.com.  As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags.  I thought I'd order a box to try.  I was very dissapointed.  It didn't taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting.  It was more like black licorice, which I hate, with a very mild rootbeer undertone.  It also didn't have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras root.<br /><br />I've never had real Sassafras tea made with the root so I don't know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not.  Bottom line:  I won't buy the teabags again."
960,960,960,961,5,Great tasting tea I have been looking for a good  Sassafras tea forever.Finally. I will be ordering this product again .<br />Thanks Kim:D
961,961,961,962,2,"I did not care for this product at all, I thought it was the same tea my sisters and I use to drink when we were in elementary school. I found out the tea we use to drink actually came from the root of a particular type of tree."
962,962,962,963,2,"I purchased this because I read that it was a natural cure for hives..Um, how about NOT.  It did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful.  Luckily, a co-worker of mine loves this stuff (reminds him of his grandmother) and I gave it to him.  Yucky, yucky stuff."
963,963,963,964,2,"These are good sunflower seeds at a good price if you prefer the unsalted variety, which can be hard to find.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind though, is the expiration or ""best by"" date.  For example, if you order these in April and the batch you receive has a June ""use by"" date, it may be a stretch to consume the 300 bags before the seeds start going rancid on you.  Since they're roasted in oil and unsalted, these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety, even if refrigerated upon receipt.<br /><br />Amazon doesn't seem to specify ""use by"" dates for the food products they sell, so it's a gamble for the purchaser.  I'm assuming that Amazon won't ship stuff that has ""expired"", but they probably ship out the oldest stock first, and the ""use by"" date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice."
964,964,964,965,5,"I love Panang Curry but would rather avoid the white rice that most restaurants serve with it.  So decided to try making my own, and with this product, I get exactly what I want, hot tasty Panang Curry adding lots of fresh veggies, tofu and brown rice.  And it's very hot, didn't have to add any spices at all.  Great product, will purchase again."
965,965,965,966,3,"I purchased this for a friend who loves to cook only to find out that I paid 3 times more than what I should be. $13.95 for 4 cans is highway robbery now that I know that I can purchase one can for around $1.09. Now as far as the item itself, this brand of Panang Paste is excellent. The beef panang dish my friend made using this paste was as good as the ones in the Thai restaurant. I would recommend the paste but not the price."
966,966,966,967,5,"Best paste I have tried! So easy to use. Just saute you meat, add veggies, paste, and a tin of coconut milk. Quick and tasty! I am on weight watchers and tried using the light coconut milk instead of the full fat. It works for the panang paste especially if you add a heaping tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter.. but the yellow, green, and red are spicy and need the full fat coconut milk to balance it out."
967,967,967,968,1,"OMG I would love these cookies except for the chocolate mixed in makes it taste medicinal. DEGUSTING isn't even a strong enough word. A horrible horrible mistake...an expensive mistake....they advertised it as peanut butter cookies which is why I bought them since everyone else had peanut butter chocolate cookies when I just wanted plan peanut butter cookies....however when I received them I found out they were the chocolate peanut butter ones but I thought okay I'll try them and omg I almost threw up from the taste. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, DISGUTINGLY, MEDICINAL TASTE. DO NOT BUY!!! If they had a zero before the stars I would rate it a zero instead of 1 star."
968,968,968,969,5,"This gravy mix is excellent ... except, don't use water where called for, use milk instead, and it makes it 100% better!!"
969,969,969,970,5,"I'm not from the south, but live in SoFla; where sometimes we get a southern influence. The gravy mix I am reviewing, PIONEER COUNTRY GRAVY is DE-LICIOUS!!! I've tried others Publix brand, Mc Cormick, ect, but this is the BEST! BY FAR! I chose to mix 1/2 water 1/2 milk, + 2 cooked, chopped sausage links, and it was phenomenal on my [...]. BISQUICK CHEESE GARLIC BISQUITS (Like Red Lobster's), served with a small side of watercress scrambled eggs. It's super easy to make and THICK! FINGER LICKIN! MMMmmmm. I heard you can put it on potatoes/veggies and chicken, make soups and add for seasoning. PIONEER BRAND as the name says is A HOMESTYLE, AMERICAN CLASSIC!"
970,970,970,971,5,Nothing easier. Nothing better. Even beats grandmother's white gravy recipe. Already peppered for you. You do nothing but mix it with water. Takes only a minute or two. I highly recommend this gravy mix. It will not disappoint.
971,971,971,972,5,"I have used Pioneer Gravy for a number of years.  It is VERY easy to make and tastes great, also.  Goes very well over mashed potatoes, meats, etc.  Try it!"
972,972,972,973,5,"Its great to be able to get sugar this way.Its not good to eat but if you are going to use sugar at least this is not processed to an unhealthy state on top of what sugar does to your body,and i am helping the  fair trade farmers.It is a good thing all around.I am happy i can get it in Amazon."
973,973,973,974,5,"I am a coffee fanatic but have always stayed away from these because I never liked instant coffee and my assumption was that this would be similar.  I really enjoy the Starbucks VIA instant coffee - but I drink so much, it is rather expensive so I thought I would give this a try.  Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with the taste.  I don't think it equals fresh brewed but it is very acceptable.  I bought my first 38 pack at my local grocery store for about $7.  That seemed a little high but I figured I would check online to find the best price.  As I started calculating all of the online prices, they are charging about $7 bucks for the 19 count.  I would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper.  So you don't have to do the math...$7 / 38 = .184 per single.  Online price $27 / 114 = .236 (shipping not calculated in).  Looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier, you can get a case of 12 boxes for $69, no sales tax and free shipping...sounds like a great deal??  12 x 19 = 228 singles so $69 / 228 = .302 per single - the most expensive at all."
974,974,974,975,4,"I don't think these coffee bags are as good as fresh ground fresh brewed coffee, but they taste far better than instant coffee.  At work, we have a water cooler with hot water dispenser.  This brewed in hot water just like a tea bag making tea tastes far better than any instant coffee.  I highly recommend it to any coffee lover when you have access to very hot water but don't have access to a coffee maker.  Individual wrapped and sealed bags allow you to take one tiny tea like bag with you in your pocket or purse to your early morning meetings."
975,975,975,976,5,I keep Regular bags and Decaf bags in my home at all times.<br />Never have to drink old coffee.  Best way to make iced coffee.
976,976,976,977,4,I live in the dorms without a kitchen so making a cup of coffee was really easy with this. Especially when I need to stay up late to study or to wake up after 2 hours of sleep. Its just like making tea and tastes decent enough. Not starbucks but good enough with some sugar and cream.
977,977,977,978,5,"My primary point with this review is to note that this packaging is less expensive than the other size offered by Folger. You get more coffee for less money.<br /><br />  I recently started drinking coffee again after a lapse of many years. Since I didn't know how many cups a day I would use, I wanted to avoid the fuss of a coffeemaker. I don't particularly like instant coffee. I was delighted to find these Folger's bags.<br /><br />  They brew a very nice tasting cup of coffee. I'm not any kind of coffee expert, so I don't know what special terms might be used. All I know is that if I let the bag seep for a bit more than a minute, it sure tastes good. Thanks to my very much better half, I've also learned that each of these bags will produce at least two good cups of coffee.<br /><br />  Very convenient, very easy, very tasty. I intend to take some of these with me when I travel as an alternative to the in-room coffee makers or (yeck!) vending machines.<br /><br />Jerry"
978,978,978,979,5,"We can't have any kind of coffee maker at work, so we're forced to buy at the in-house coffee shop or Starbuck's across the street. In this economy, no one wants to pay those high prices, so we started a coffee club. 20 of us buy these coffee bags and separate creamer and enjoy fresh, hot, tasty coffee every day without paying the coffee shop prices. thanks Folgers!!!"
979,979,979,980,5,"These are great for at work, just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee. This is the best tasting coffee. It's easy to make without a mess."
980,980,980,981,5,"Fast, easy and definitely delicious.  Makes a great cup of coffee and very easy to make.  Good purchase.  Will continue to order from here.<br />Thanx..."
981,981,981,982,5,"I gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit. And I'm glad I did. It has a somewhat sweet and almost minty taste and a wonderful aroma. It has a nice reddish color. This tea probably has more of a taste factor than any of the wonderful japanese green matcha tea I've had, and I look forward to experiencing any of the purported health benefits of rooibos that I've read about."
982,982,982,983,5,"I tried this before having normal red tea so I waited to review. The flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity. The color is that of muddy water, and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well. Well worth every penny."
983,983,983,984,5,"I previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price.  I decided to give Pure Matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive.  The quality of Pure Matcha's products surpasses that of all others I have tried- stays fresh, has a consistent texture and tastes great.  Both the quality and price are better than others that I have purchased for the same quantity.  I highly recommend Pure Matcha and will continue to purchase."
984,984,984,985,5,"This is the very best marinade you can buy as far as I am concerned---of course, everyone to his or her own tastes, but all in all, I think anyone will like it---I give it five stars..."
985,985,985,986,5,"This is a great product for those looking for an MSG and Gluten free product, and is also lower sodium than any other marinade or soy sauce out there! It doesn't compromise of taste either, I use it as a Soy Sauce substitute and have found it to have superior taste and it looks and acts just like any good marinade should. If you are Celiac or Gluten intolerant, or even just watching you salt intake, this product is a way to have your steak and marinade it too!"
986,986,986,987,5,My poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try and<br />our family really enjoyed it. I looked at the ingredients and was quite pleased<br />with the natural ingredients and no calories.
987,987,987,988,5,"This hot sauce is one of my favorites. Its a perfect balance of tasty and spicy. You can smell the flavors immediately when you open the bottle. A mix of garlic, habanero, and other spices. I put this on everything and tend to go through one bottle a week. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes hot sauce."
988,988,988,989,5,"I was never much of a hot sauce fan until I tasted Black Market Hot Sauce. I was listning to the radio one morning and the creater/owner was giving an interview, It sounded interesting. The D.J.'s were sampling the sauce and raving about it, So I picked up a bottle at the local grocery, It's so good ! I keep a bottle in the kitchen and an extra bottle on hand for gifts and for taking to potlucks,barbecues and party's. Happy to see I can buy it online at Amazon."
989,989,989,990,5,This is my favorite hot sauce! I liketo use it to give anything some extra flavor. I have loved going out to some of my favorite resturants in town and seeing that they are offering this great product.I really enjoy putting on my my breakfast burritos!
990,990,990,991,5,"They have this in a local diner that I eat in regularly.  I use it on all kinds of foods and I love it.  It's hot, but not without flavor.  I don't like those sauces that just burn but have no taste.  This has both burn and and awesome flavor.  I was surprised to find it on Amazon (just stumbled across it).  I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good hot sauce."
991,991,991,992,5,"I was browsing around on Amazon looking for gifts and was very pleased to see my favorite sauce on here. I will just order and have shipped to my friends. Habanero is my favorite, I love the heat and the tangy spiciness. I also love the pineapple. You will not go wrong ordering this up."
992,992,992,993,5,This is my favorite hot sauce. I buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have. Hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy! My favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far. Thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce!
993,993,993,994,5,So far I have had the habanero and the medium sauces and they were amazing. My fiance and I use them nearly daily and I just picked up 3 more. It goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kick.<br /><br />The sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears. It is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use. We love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in burritos and for dinners or soups for added spice.
994,994,994,995,5,"absolutely love the habenaro sauce...use it on eggs, sandwiches most anything for a good kick! have watched the progessing popularity of theis homegrown product...have nothing but the highes accolades for the chef and the product..get out there and try it!"
995,995,995,996,5,"BLACK MARKET HOT SAUCE IS WONDERFUL.... My husband Loves this Habenero sauce, its very very flavorful with a nice kick to it. I in fact love the medium sauce- the taste is so yummy with a bit of zing behind it. We used it for everything and you can use it with any meal.<br /><br />I like the fact that there are so many different levels of spicyness. We love the medium & habenero. Kind of like a ""HIS & HERS package"". Thank you for your hard work guys! Keep up the hard work."
996,996,996,997,5,"Man what can i say, this salsa is the bomb!! i have all the different kinds. i have it with almost every meal. the owner is a cool dude, He's dropped off free bottles to me in my mailbox. i stole the first bottle out of a friends fridge after i tasted and been hooked since. dont sleep on this hot sauce!!"
997,997,997,998,5,"this sauce is so good with just about anything, i like adding it to asian food or anything with egg or noodles, it has a good burn with a strong flavor. im hoping to see some of the other flavors like the pineapple experiment on here soon. buy it you wont regret it"
998,998,998,999,1,"Not hot at all. Like the other low star reviewer, I got suckered by seeing 'habenero' in the name and the 12 oz size. Some people might like the flavor, citrus-y and it has some fish sauce in the mix (according to the ingredient label), but if you're looking for hot this ain't it"
999,999,999,1000,2,"I have to admit, I was a sucker for the large quantity, 12 oz, when shopping for hot sauces ...but now seeing the size of the bottle, it reminds of wing-sauce bottle sizes.  Plastic bottle.  It does have a convenient squirt top.  But overall, not very hot or tasty, and made mostly from jalape&ntilde;os.  If I had seen the ingredients list I would not have bought it:<br />Jalapenos<br />Water<br />Vinegar<br />Brown Sugar<br />Lime Juice<br />Fish Sauce<br />Cilantro<br />Habanero<br />Garlic<br />Spice Blend<br />Salt<br />Potassium Sorbate<br />Xanthan Gum"

1001,1001,1001,1002,4,"I am so convinced these are human animal crackers. They look and taste EXACTLY like human ones (yes, I tasted it) and they contain sugar, which is not one of the last ingredients in the nutrition facts either. So ill just give my dog very small amounts."
1002,1002,1002,1003,5,I have a whole box of peanut butter dog cookies and she wont touch them. She loves these and begs for them so it was a good buy. She is a little chihuhua and they are not too big for her mouth. About 20 per box.
1003,1003,1003,1004,3,"These little animal crackers taste good & my doggies like them, but I won't be buying again. They are like the human animal crackers & have flour & sugar & other bad stuff for dogs. I will continue to buy the healthy treats for my doggies which they also love without sugar. You might want to try Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Natural Balance, Zukes, just to name a few."
1004,1004,1004,1005,5,My chihuahua loves these lil snacks. When she sees me bring out the yellow bus she literally runs in circles!
1005,1005,1005,1006,5,I purchased these little treats as stocking stuffers for our little furry friends.  Both Yorkies LOVED these treats.  We had to finally buy more since they liked them so much.
1006,1006,1006,1007,5,These are just like the animal crackers we eat.  The price is great and my little guy loves them!
1007,1007,1007,1008,3,The smell at first was just like a bed of fresh roses. Even though the rose content is very minimal I found the smell overwhelming. I did not like that this brand of spices does not have a seal in place and only a loosely screwed on lid. There is no shaker lid either. You open it and it dumps. I am questioning how only a few minute pieces of roses could produce such a perfume odor. I hope it is not chemically enhanced. With the lid being loose and not sealed I have doubts about the safety of the product.
1008,1008,1008,1009,3,"I was hoping these were more true caramels, not caramel-flavored truffles, but they're still delicious. Would definitely order them again, and maybe extra for gifts. The salt just makes them extra amazing.<br /><br />Bummer about the shipping-- shipping on this item is reasonable, but we bought the chocolate covered pretzels at the same time, and shipping was charged for both items even though they arrived in the same box. There wasn't even anything fancy about the packaging!<br /><br />edit: okay, these actually bother my stomach a little after one truffle. the package wasn't shipped with an ingredients list, and i had to go to the company site directly and find a well-hidden and hard to follow ingredients page to discover there's a lot of shady ingredients, including high fructose corn syrup. For $40 a box, I expect NO CORN SYRUP. I also don't expect propylene glycol (antifreeze) in vanilla, which I expect to be 100% vanilla beans, and NOT artificial vanillin (which sometimes comes from the anal glands of beavers). I'm disappointed in the ingredient quality.<br /><br />http://www.premiumchocolatiers.com/ingredient_info.php<br /><br />Review goes from 5 stars to 3. I'd make it 2, but the extra star is because they ARE quite delicious."
1009,1009,1009,1010,2,Ive been craving some deer jerky for a while so i gave this one and some others on amazon a try. This one was very sinue and a little too sweet for my taste. Not going to buy again. Im still on my search for the salty dry version im after
1010,1010,1010,1011,5,"I tried this and I found it too salty.<br />Plus I ate this fish sauce with some fish but I realized it was kind of redundant.<br /><br />I'm kidding, of course. This stuff is great!"
1011,1011,1011,1012,5,I don't usually drink tea but I love this one. I thought the shipping price was a little high but love the tea so much that I had to get it. Perfect with a little bit of Honey.
1012,1012,1012,1013,1,The noodles in the box were all broken.  The sauce was over salted and did not have a good flavor.  I threw out most of the skillet.  I would recommend not purchasing this product.
1013,1013,1013,1014,5,"Cavenders makes the best vinegar and oil dressing ever. couple of tbls of cavenders and 1/4 vinager and 1/4 h2O, rest oil. good!"
1014,1014,1014,1015,5,"It's balanced, it's tasty, it's filling, it's good for you -- what more could you ask of a breakfast cereal?<br /><br />I still miss Kellogg's sister product, Just Right, which was a somewhat lighter blend (I loved it, they discontinued it), but Mueslix is a strong second-best."
1015,1015,1015,1016,5,Don't know why I can't find these in my supermarket but I can't.  You get pack of 5 when you order.  Was afraid 5 boxes would last too long.  Instead found I need to order another 5-pack.
1016,1016,1016,1017,2,"On a trip to Italy, muesli is what all the hotels had for breakfast as their cold cereal and I loved it.  Imagine how excited I was when I saw that Kellog's sold this product.  What did I learn?: despite the similar name, this cereal is quite unlike European-style muesli.  While the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar, this cereal is mostly a flake cereal, while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all.<br /><br />""Real"" muesli is made of rolled (not flaked) grains; this has pluses and minuses.  On the plus side, milk does not turn European mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals.  On the minus side, European mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so (i.e. while you are in the shower, or while the coffee is brewing) or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side.  For those that are concerned about eating processed foods, rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones.  (Rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted; flaked grains are fully steam-cooked until they are mush, pressed into flakes, fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend ""time-to-mushiness."")  And certainly only the Kellog's product contains HFCS.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from Amazon (or better yet, single boxes from a local health-foods store if you have one) and see what you prefer.  I eat the Bob's Red Mill product available on Amazon (and one of my local grocery chains) instead of this, and am much more satisfied.  I haven't tried Familia (but I'm not crazy about the idea of the ""fruit flakes""), and the Dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me.  The other products are a hair more expensive than the Kellog's, but I'm willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior product.<br /><br />I'm surprised Quaker doesn't sell a muesli product...  Given that they have to be the largest producer of rolled grains in the U.S., you'd think it would be a natural fit for them."
1017,1017,1017,1018,2,"Recently purchased this cereal assuming it would contain nothing but healthy ingredients, then I read the label and discovered it contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil and high fructose corn syrup."
1018,1018,1018,1019,5,"I bought this product online because, although it is a Kellogg cereal, I cannot find a retail store which carries it, and incidentally I would like to know why. I called Kellogg and they could really give me no good answer, and suggested I try another product of theirs, which i found not as good as this. I appreciate that Amazon offers this, and I will continue to order it.  By the way,  it really keeps me ""regular"", better than any other cereal.  Try it, you'll like it."
1019,1019,1019,1020,5,"This cereal is difficult to find in the stores so I appreciate being able to purchase it through Amazon.  My husband really likes it and looks forward to the delivering of it every month.  Seems like an unlikely thing to look forward to, but it's the little things that count.  P. Looney"
1020,1020,1020,1021,5,"You could find this in local supermarkets about 4 months ago but now it nowhere to be found. Every time Kellogg's makes a great cereal, they quit making it soon after. This is the case with Just Right, THAT WAS THE BEST STUFF ON THE PLANET!"
1021,1021,1021,1022,5,"This has been my favorite cereal for probably 20 years.  The grocery stores stopped selling it, so I've started buying it on the web in packs of 5 boxes.  I use them up pretty fast."
1022,1022,1022,1023,5,"I LOVE THIS CEREAL.  NOT ONLY DOES IT TASTE GOOD, IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.  IT'S A PITY THAT I CAN'T FIND THIS CEREAL IN ANY OF THE LOCAL SUPERMARKETS.  OTHER BRANDS DO NOT MATCH UP."
1023,1023,1023,1024,5,"Have been enjoying Mueslix since early '90s.  Some reason, I can not locate mueslix in local supermarkets in New York, so I order through Amazon.  Taste is perfect not so sweet.  I do not care too much about raisins but in this cereal I do enjoy greatly.  It is enjoyable way to supplement fibers with whole grain, a perfect breakfast that lasts until lunch time!  Tried all different kind & choices of many cereals out there but there is nothing like Mueslix;"
1024,1024,1024,1025,5,"Amazon's price may be higher than some grocery stores, but it isn't in my store so this is a good way to shop.<br />I first tried this on a Princess cruise ship.  I found it is very good and filling.  It stays with me, which is very important.<br />I am super please to find this!"
1025,1025,1025,1026,5,"I almost can't stop eating this cereal...I eat it for breakfast and then in the evening, when I think I want something to eat and am really not hungry, I snack on these.  After all, it's healthy, so long as I remembeer it's not healthy to eat a cup or more.  Enjoy!"
1026,1026,1026,1027,5,Our local stores all stopped carrying this product and were putting their own imitation brands on the shelf......just not the same!  Great that I could order and have my cereal within days!
1027,1027,1027,1028,5,"Mueslix has been my favorite cereal since it came out years ago.  HOWEVER, they have (improved????) it by adding more raisins and nuts to the point of making it too rich!  I simply add about half of a grain cereal, such as cornflakes which also reduces the high price.  Stores keep discontinuing Mueslix to the point that it is hard to find!  Thank you Amazon!"
1028,1028,1028,1029,5,"This cereal is hard to find in local stores where I live. My wife and I love this cereal for its taste and healthfulness. Whenever I find it in some hotel breakfast buffets, I am a happy man. I cannot think of eating any other cereal."
1029,1029,1029,1030,5,"Kellogg's Mueslix had replaced local muesli previously served in European B&B's on our last trip. Not available locally, but Amazon provided with a fair price, rapid delivery and no shipping cost with my Prime Shipping. Excellent form of Muesli!"

1034,1034,1034,1035,5,"It was a sad moment when I was unable to find my favorite cereal in the grocery stores.  I'm not sure why it disappeared, but am so grateful I'm able to purchace this online.  Thanks!"

She was buying Kellogg's Mueslix when she lived in Florida, but when I went to buy it for her in NY where she is, I had no luck. I called Kellogg's themselves and they directed me to Amazon.com. I was so please that they sold the ceral and I can have it shipped for free to her. I also save money on each box and I also do not have to pay for the shipping. So now you have two happy people, my mom who gets her favorite ceral shipped directly every few months(they send 5 boxes)and me for saving money and time shopping and shipping the package to my mom."
1037,1037,1037,1038,4,"I have been struggling to find them in the shops nearby.<br />Much more convenient to order them through Amazon (slightly more expensive, but I save the gas and the burden)."
1038,1038,1038,1039,5,The Kellogg Mueslix Cereal was ordered one evening and just a couple of days later it arrived. The item was well packed. Contents were fresh. Encountered no problems<br />and plan to use this resource again.
1039,1039,1039,1040,3,"I really like the Mueslix cereal, but the Amazon price is awful.<br />$22.73 for a 5 pack is over $4.50 a box.<br />This product RETAILS in the stores here for around $4 a box (Publix, Kroger, Ingles).<br />So the Amazon price is higher than retail.<br /><br />Mueslix is almost never on sale though, unlike other Kellogg's cereals.<br />1-2 times per year, Publix grocery has all Kellogg's cereals for half price.<br />$2/box is an incredible price and we stock up for the next several weeks.<br /><br />I expected the Amazon price to be more like $3/box, since it was a 5 pack.<br />But boy was I wrong."

Unfortunately, it's also no secret that it has replaced other forms of sugar in a disturbingly large number of manufactured foods. Even worse is that most high fructose corn syrup is made from genetically modified corn.<br /><br />Since the late 1980s, HFCS has replaced regular table sugar, honey, and similar sweeteners in practically everything. Prolonged consumption of HFCS is now the topic of much debate and we are learning that it can cause long-term damage to the body.<br />High Fructose Corn Syrup Dangers<br /><br />1. Significant Risk of Weight Gain & Obesity<br />2. Increased Risk of Developing Type-2 Diabetes<br />3. Hypertension and Elevated ""Bad"" Cholesterol Levels<br />4.  Long-Term Liver Damage<br />5. Mercury Exposure from HFCS<br /><br />Kelloggs and other manufacturers know this and are slowly getting rid of this sweetner. Look at the cover of Post Rain Bran. They are advertising that it contains NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP.I applaud them for this. High Fructose Corn Syrup is made from genetically modified corn from Monsanto which uses systemic pesticides in their seeds which is causing Colony collapse disorder in bees. I am a bee keeper and have been avoiding all products with HFCS in them to save my family and the bees. Watch vanishing of the Bees,Food Matters and Food Inc. They are all sold on Amazon. Excellent movies which will change your health dramatically and the way you think and eat."
1041,1041,1041,1042,5,"Local grocery stores don't carry this cereal so I order it. It is full of nuts, raisins, and other great stuff. I cut up a banana in it instead of adding sugar. My favorite box cereal."
1042,1042,1042,1043,5,"Just got the baby back ribs and the strips of jerky out of the smoker, wow this seasoning really added a lot of flavor, what was surprising was the fact that I knew I had added to much seasoning but it didn't turn out over powering. I would recommend this to anyone who is cooking any kind of meat, the jerky is great, but the ribs are outstanding, and for 27$ including shipping for 12lbs, awesome deal."
1043,1043,1043,1044,5,"I try every Asian salad dressing I can find.<br />This is my favorite one for salads because of it's delicate taste.<br />My other favorite is ""Newman's Own, Low Fat Sesame Ginger"".<br />The ginger in Newman's gives it a stronger flavor which is great<br />as a marinade or just sprinkle on rice and vege dishes."
1044,1044,1044,1045,5,"Wow, this is soooo good and has easily become my favorite dressing! I typically make my own dressings, however I do use this one as a treat!<br /><br />It was given to me as a gift and I absolutely love it! It's a perfect balance of sweet and oily and bitter. Granted, it needs a good shaking since it's oil based! I absolutely love this and am sad I am running out! If you eat salads like me every day, then you will want this dressing! It's unique and I NEVER had somebody over who didn't love it! :)"
1045,1045,1045,1046,3,"i bought the liter size bottles of this dressing on Amazon, so i am assuming they are the same since they have the same name and the nutritional facts are identical. This dressing is definitely too sweet for my taste. My wife agrees. Otherwise very good. I use it on tossed salads only."
1046,1046,1046,1047,1,Coffee beans did not seem fresh.  No oil on them what so ever.  I have tasted much better and fresher.  Will not order again.
1047,1047,1047,1048,5,"This coffee company delivers on great coffee taste!!  I like my coffee with deep, robust taste and Jeremiah's always is!!  It makes me glad to purchase it!!  Thanks!!"
1048,1048,1048,1049,4,"This is a cute product to use in place of sprinkles - the bright colors of candy coating look great, and the chocolate center keeps them from being overly sweet.<br /><br />However this price is roughly double what you pay at Michael's (or Marshall's, when they stock stuff like this). Plus you can get the same product but in a 16 oz bag on Amazon here: http://www.amazon.com/CK-Products-Rainbow-Candy-Coated/dp/B00375LAO0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1300131716&sr=1-1. Comes with Prime shipping too!"
1049,1049,1049,1050,1,Tossed this out after trying it.  Texture and taste were far below expectations.  Seemed kind of mushy and pasty.  Pricy to boot.
1050,1050,1050,1051,5,I actually gave these to a local baker for my daughters cupcakes. They looked great. Showed up perfectly on white and chocolate icing. In great shape.
1051,1051,1051,1052,5,"This is the first time I've used the coconut oil from Manila Coco Factory and I was so pleased with the taste, smell and overall incredible quality that I will buy more and recommend it to my family and friends.  I am so glad I tried it. I have been using coconut oil for several years and it has changed my life and health.  This oil ranks high in my book. Also, I liked ordering this product through amazon because they make it fast, easy and painless. Thank you for having this product on your site Amazon."
1052,1052,1052,1053,2,"They claim this product is ""unadulterated"", which would make you think ""oh! sweet! it's going to be the BEST, because nobody else's coconut oil says it's ""unadulterated"".  I checked out their website, and for those of you who don't know... you want to go for COLD PRESSED oils. If they're not cold pressed, it means they've been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats, which as anything goes, can and usually does, kill any good minerals and vitamins. Their site posts information on their extraction process. As of today, this is what it states:<br /><br />""""Manila Coco oil extraction method is through a proprietary, state-of-the-art mechanical expeller (Manila VirginFlo), thermo-stable to hold off the lowest moisture possible (0.1%) to avoid rancidity and keep shelf life consistent up to 3 years under normal conditions. Our oils are 1st and 2nd stage press-induced, without chemical solvents, no bleaching, no deodorizing, no hydrogenation, no fermentation enzymes - to keep its natural light sweet coconut aroma and taste. This method sustains its unique character even when subjected to high (up to 170 degrees Celsius) heat temperatures.""""<br /><br />Mechanical Expeller is their form of extraction. And they also say it sustains unique character... blah blah blah... when subjected to high heat temperatures. Therefore, in my personal opinion, it is not as ""unadulterated"" as their information on their products on Amazon make them sound. I will be steering clear of their products.<br /><br />I'm sorry if my review offends some, but if you're going to pay good money for something, you should know about it. I would use different brands before sticking yourself with this one. I was looking for larger quantities, which is why I looked at this product, however I will be sticking with Nutiva. As their coconut oil is cold pressed soon after the coconuts are cut open. The information below is direct from their website.<br /><br />""""What makes Nutiva's virgin coconut oil so special? Much of the magic lies in the way the oil is processed. Within several hours of the coconuts being chopped, the meat is cold-pressed, unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing. Nutiva's approach preserves as much of the oil's natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you the best results for any use.""""<br /><br />If you don't care about how it's processed, it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found vegetable and canola oils. If you want to read some scary things, look up the dark information on how those are processed. YUCK! Talk about horrifying.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.<br />-Amy<br /><br />PS. I used to be one of those ""organic? what kind of fruitcake are you? Think you're more special than anybody else?"" people. But I have learned so much in the past year and a half, dealing with my son's allergies and intollerances. There's more to it than ""oh it's more expensive, so it's just making me feel special because I can afford it."" No. There's WAY more to it than that. I urge everybody to talk to people about organic foods. It's a way of life, a healthier way of life. We all deserve to live healthier. If you live healthier, even though it costs more, in the long term you're saving money because you are healthier. So that means less doctor visits, less expensive (and nasty harmful) medications, etc."
1053,1053,1053,1054,5,"I ordered the White Christmas, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Morning blends last year for the holidays and fell in love with the Christmas eve.  It's the smoothest of the bunch and has such a wonderful flavor, I use it for iced teas all year round.  I can honestly say that I never got into tea that much until I tried STASH teas.  I sent the licorice and lemon flavors to my father, and he called me to ask where I'd gotten it, because his neighbor wanted to get some for his wife, too.  Once tried, you will be addicted. Visit the stashtea website for lots of tea related bits and baubles.  These make perfect hostess gifts over the holidays along with a plate of cookies."
1054,1054,1054,1055,5,"This is my very favorite tea of all. I drink it year-round and never get tired of it like I do of others. It's good any time of the day. Not too strong, but still nicely flavorful, with a good balance of minty/spicy/herbal-y."
1055,1055,1055,1056,5,"Christmas Eve tea (which does not actually contain tea) is not just for Christmas Eve. (Although if you are frazzled, it does releave the stress.) Christmas Eve is good any time. I do not know anyone who doesn't like it, and have often given it as gifts. It is especially nice in the winter when mint teas are a little too brisk and do not produce the same level of cozy comfort as Christmas Eve which is a soothing combination of spices and mint. It is almost as comforting as a cup of warm milk, but without the calories."
1056,1056,1056,1057,5,"Riba foods based in Houston, Texas makes this awesome black bean dip. It is pretty much all natural and without the lard that regular refried bean dip has in it. I am not sure why in Dallas TX it's so hard to find - maybe because Riba has SO Many good flavors??? I make the traditional 7-layer dip with this instead of the refried beans, and am thinking about creating a breakfast quesadilla with this and some verde sauce. Try it, it's not too too spicy but is very good!"
1057,1057,1057,1058,3,I was expecting to receive only Starburst. When I received this it was half Skittles which I did not want or need.  I needed only Starburst.  Next time I will just go to the store.
1058,1058,1058,1059,2,"The Good:<br /><br />Walker shortbread cookies are my favorite, I love them.  I bought the highlanders and each set of cookies came individually wrapped with two cookies each.  If this were the end of it, a five star review.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon shipped them in a box that was about the same size as the container they came in from the Walkers cookie company.  After UPS was through with the shipment, my cookies were reduced to crumbs.  I contacted Amazon about this problem without ever receiving a response.  Since I bought these ""Shipped and Sold by Amazon"", I won't be purchasing these cookies from Amazon again."

And the price is nice, too...as well as Amazon.com. I love this place!"
1060,1060,1060,1061,5,"Walker's Highlanders are my favorite purchased cookie, so it was great to find them pre-packaged into 2 biscuits. Keeps them fresh longer and limits my snacking!"

1062,1062,1062,1063,1,"My cookies were in such tiny broken pieces ,they were useless. Upon complaint, a second mailing arrived several weeks later. The cookies were again in crumbs. The cookies were packed in  a box with a pitiful single air bubble. I gave this feedback and expected some effort to improve on the packing. But no, same packaging, same useless cookies.  Having enjoyed these Highlanders in the past, it was both a disappointment and a big waste of money."
1063,1063,1063,1064,5,COULDN'T FIND THESE ANYWHERE BUT ON LINE - IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT BECAUSE THEY ARE TRULLY GREAT TASTING COOKIES.
1064,1064,1064,1065,5,"Yes, these cubes are expensive; in fact, I almost gave them four stars for the expense.  Regardless, these sugar cubes are my favorite sugar product.  I've tried every brown sugar and cane sugar product you can find on Amazon and in your grocery store, and none of them compare to the rich, sweet, unique flavor of the brown sugar cubes by La Perruche.  Because I've tried so many brown sugar products, I believe the difference is the terroir, or the ground/land, where this sugar is grown.  La Perruche sugar cubes are made from African grown sugar; more specifically, sugar grown in Swaziland and/or the Congo.  Also, the cubes are denser than many sugar cubes.  I don't know from a scientific perspective how this is accomplished, but the cubes are not regularly sized, but are large and irregularly shaped, and heavier/sturdier than ""cut"" cubes by other producers.<br /><br />The flavor is a rich, distinct and more molasses-y flavor than other brown sugar cubes, and is somewhat darker as well.  I wish I could describe the flavor better, but it has been several months since I was able to find a somewhat affordable supply.  BTW, now that this product is being sold with free shipping via Amazon Prime, I just purchased several boxes - it is a much better deal as of the date of this review than it was a few months ago.  Recommended!"
1065,1065,1065,1066,5,We love these sugar cubes in the office.  They aren't your grandmother's sugar cube.  They have a rugged appearance (can sugar cubes be considered rugged).  And we combine them with the white sugar cubes from La Perruche.
1066,1066,1066,1067,4,Love this for espressos...the raw sugar cube is not as sweet as the refined sugars and more rich in flavor.
1067,1067,1067,1068,3,"It's a good idea to have raw sugar type cubes, but this was 3x the cost of granulated raw sugar"
1068,1068,1068,1069,5,"Due to my husband's and son's inability to eat gluten, cornstarch is used very frequently in many gluten free recipes.  I am very concerned with the prolific use of GMOs in corn especially and my family's increased consumption of it.  I wanted to find an affordable GMO free cornstarch product to use in all my baking.  Rumford Natural Cornstarch is the one!  I've been using it for months now with great success & satisfaction."
1069,1069,1069,1070,1,"I purchased this product because of its name, ""Rumford NATURALS Corn Starch"" (the word ""Naturals"" appears large and clear on the pictured product label). Also, the Amazon description said it was made from ""Non-Genetically Modified Corn"". The label on the product that I ACTUALLY received does NOT say Rumford NATURALS, but it is still MADE WITH Non-Genetically Modified Corn. I say ""made with"" because this product now contains more than ONE ingredient. Its ingredients are: Cornstarch, Calcium Sulfate*, and ONE of the suggested servings (1 Tblsp) contains 15% of the ""Daily Value"" of CALCIUM. That makes this product potentially a good source for dietary calcium supplementation. ON THE OTHER HAND, for persons who must restrict their calcium intake (example, some persons with kidney stones), it can pose a potential problem, even danger. Amazon provides themselves with a nice ""out"" for this. They list the following: Legal Disclaimer: ""Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product."" BUT, IT IS NOT FAIR FOR AMAZON TO NOT AT LEAST LIST THE CORRECT INGREDIENTS AND PHOTO OF THE PACKAGE SO THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ORDER THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO ""READ LABELS"" AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU HAVE PURCHASED.<br /><br />I WILL NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN:<br /> * because I don't need extra calcium<br /> * because I don't believe that the Calcium Sulfate was added out of interest in the consumer's health<br />  but to make the product cheaper to produce so it can be priced competitively with other brands<br />  and still be touted as having been made from/with Non-Genetically Modified Corn<br /> and just on principal because I can't afford to throw it away and did not want the hassle of returning it.<br /><br />I am very, very displeased with Amazon's incorrect listing of the product, which was brought to their attention when I purchased it in February 2012, and so far nothing has been done.<br /><br />*Although Calcium Sulfate is considered a safe food additive it is basically the same thing as Plaster of Paris. AND, if you use too much of this product (basically the same amount as I had previous used of pure CORN STARCH), the very stiff sediment in the bottom of the cooking container (I make pudding in Pyrex in a microwave and usually stir it only every 30 seconds) will remind you of damp plaster!"
1070,1070,1070,1071,1,Was really bummed to find out that these chocolates had melted before they got to my daughter for her bday.  Seems that they should not be sold online if there is not a way to keep them 'safe'.  :-(
1071,1071,1071,1072,5,"If you love garlic, I recommend this flavored oil.  It is true to its name.  I was not expecting it to be so strong, so if I use it for cooking or dipping bread, I will mix it with some unflavored olive oil in the future."
1072,1072,1072,1073,5,"These things are AWESOME. Perfect size, truly wafer thin, consistent thickness of dark chocolate over minty interior. They are like what would happen if you could run a steamroller over a junior mint. I first tried them when I was living in Germany 16 years ago, and to this day no other mint comes close. And the copycat ones? Disgusting. Go for the original. You won't regret it. Each mint is in its own sleeve, so you can pass them out without ever touching one. Elegant and delicious. Love them!"
1073,1073,1073,1074,5,"Love these mints.  They melt in your mouth and taste better than any others I have tried.  Just wish they weren't so expensive.  You can't eat just one, a couple.  They are addictively delicious."
1074,1074,1074,1075,5,I got it for my girlfriend. Very good stuff. Now everybody in the house eats them. Very hight quality if you are into chocolate and mint.
1075,1075,1075,1076,5,"A friend's favorite candy is ""After Eight"", but they are not available anywhere in my area.  I couldn't find them on-line either.  Amazon.com came through.  These are imported from England and the most delicious peppermint.  These are so thin with a smooth mint cream center and a dark chocolate shell.  If you just want a little taste of mint, this is for you.  Really special with a cup of hot coffee!"
1076,1076,1076,1077,4,"Nature's Recipe is now a division of that mega company Del Monte Foods.<br /><br />The Test<br /><br />The neat thing about this food is that it really does look like the photograph on the bag. It consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in. When the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of Farm Selects unmixed and readily took to it. Since then they've been eating it mixed with their Blue food.<br /><br />I thought Evie and Piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there, but they don't specifically target the vegetables to leave behind.<br /><br />The quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list. Only one ingredient, that animal digest, makes me cringe a little. The girls don't mind it a bit. For goodness alone I can heartily recommend this natural food, but the price on it is relatively high. Rachel Ray's dry dog food, for example, is about half the price of Farm Stands Selects, and Buffalo Blue is about the same price. For a household like ours with three dogs, the Farm Stands Selects is too pricey  to feed the girls exclusively. We'd feel obliged to mix another good, but less expensive food with it. For those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue, I say you can't go wrong with Farm Selects."
1077,1077,1077,1078,5,"You will not find a better loose green tea for the price.  I was able to get free shipping as well since I bought it with something else that totaled over $25.  This is the tea used by many Japanese people.  Do not fall for those high-priced ""organic"" green teas produced by American companies.  They are good...but you are not getting anything better than Hime Ban Cha Tea."
1078,1078,1078,1079,5,"This is the favorite green tea in our household.  Been using it for years.  Was happy to find it here on Amazon, otherwise we had to travel about forty miles to an oriental grocery store to purchase it.  Can't even buy any leaf tea of any kind in regular grocery stores any more.  By the way ""Ban Cha"" in Japan simply means common or everyday tea.  Not ceremonial."
1079,1079,1079,1080,5,"I love this tea!! It is so flavorful yet there is no cut grass or off flavor as with some green teas. It is so mild that even left steeping it does not become bitter.It has a very mellow flavor that my kids enjoy too.It's great without sweeteners.<br /> It is a loose leaf tea and when steeped the leaves unfurl,long and slender. A little tea goes a long way. Enjoy!"
1080,1080,1080,1081,5,"I have been drinking this green tea for sometime and was purchasing it when I was going to Syracuse every summer.  This year I stopped going there and didn't know where I was going to buy my tea until I spotted it on Amazon and purchased it.  I was so pleased  that I could get it, so I am now a happy camper once again."
1081,1081,1081,1082,5,"This is the real deal. Genmai Cha. Loose green tea and roasted brown rice. Not in bags. Originally known as the ""Peoples Tea"" for those who couldn't afford better. Very popular because of its mild flavor. You can drink it all day long (like I do). You won't be disappointed."
1082,1082,1082,1083,5,"Gatorade G2 is the way to go when you want the benefits of Gatorade without quite so much sugar. As I am in a ""pre-diabetes"" state these days, I am drinking this type of Gatorade instead of the regular Gatorade which has noticeably more sugar in it. The really good thing is that this still replenishes carbs and electrolytes after I exercise without putting unnecessary extra sugar into my system.<br /><br />G2 comes in flavors including fruit punch and grape.<br /><br />If you're on the go, the advantage of these bottles of Gatorade is this: because the bottles are smaller you can carry them with you much easier than if you took the regular, larger size bottles of Gatorade G2.<br /><br />I highly recommend this drink if you need extra carbs or electrolytes after exercising; it replenishes them very well without the extra sugar found in regular Gatorade."
1083,1083,1083,1084,1,All my fault. I thought this would be a carton of 3 boxes of cereal.  Instead it was 1 box of cereal for 12.99. Who sells cereal for this price plus $8.00 shipping ? I feel stupid!  Buyer Beware!
1084,1084,1084,1085,1,"This is not jerky, this is processed, hard like a rock, very greasy and stale smelling stripe of something that you can't break into anything smaller than 2 inches long and that certainly is not the size of a training treat! The dogs- 45lb dogs that will eat anything- were not impressed, it was hard to chew, and it sounded like they were crunching rocks, most of them spat it out after a few chews, left it there, this would be the first time they would not eat something in their entire lives, these dogs will work for lettuce. Where is a zero star button?"
1085,1085,1085,1086,2,I ordered both the beef and Turkey flavors. My dogs would not even take these in their mouths. Both flavors were  very dry and had no real aroma to them. Try a small quantity first. i  donated the entire order to the Humane Society.
1086,1086,1086,1087,3,"This does not reflect on the product but my shi-tzus took them and left them laying on the carpet. Normally with chicken or turkey snacks, they go nuts.I donated both containers to the Humane Society. I'd try a smaller quantity for a first order."

1088,1088,1088,1089,5,"My partner is very happy with the tea, and is feeling much better since starting to drink it.<br />She has been drinking it both hot (normal) and iced (chilled) and likes the refreshing nature of it."
1089,1089,1089,1090,5,"This tea won an award in the USA and I know why....""Mandarin Silk Loose Leaf Oolong Tea""  is like the name suggests ""Silk"" silk on your tongue.  A tea that has a warm, relaxing taste that makes you feel wonderful...Well done ""Art of Tea""!"
1090,1090,1090,1091,3,"I originally ordered two teas from Art of Tea - the Silver Needles and the Coconut Creme. When my package came in, they had shipped the Coconut Creme and mistakenly bundled it with this Mandarin Silk tea by accident. I contacted Amazon and they refunded the Silver Needles and told me I could ""dispose of the Mandarin Silk Oolong as I saw fit."" Well, since I'm never one to turn down tea, I chose to dispose of it by, well, drinking it.<br /><br />This isn't a bad tea, first off. I don't have too much experience with oolongs, but I do like the flavor of this. However, I don't taste too much of the mandarin. It almost tastes sort of like a straight green tea, and it has a similar light green/yellow color. I drink it with a little honey.<br /><br />All in all, it's a decent tea. I don't think I'll order it again, but I'll certainly finish off this tin."
1091,1091,1091,1092,5,"These are identical to ""Jay's hot chips"" (are they made by the same company?).  They have a slightly sweet taste, with a nice bit of heat. Definately not overwhelming heat, on a heat scale of 1-5, I would give these about a 2.  Regarding the texture, these are not kettle cooked chips, so they do not have much crunch, they are comparable to regular Lays chips.  For about $1 a bag, they are a great deal."
1092,1092,1092,1093,4,"I first had these Uncle Ray's chips a few years ago while traveling out west. I tracked them down on Amazon and recognized the name. They are just as good as I remember: smoky sweet with just enough kick, and there's adequate seasoning on all of the chips. Each bag also has a little story, courtesy of Uncle Ray, that usually has some moral message or anecdote. They are pretty funny, but not intentionally. My only problem with these chips is their texture. They're a bit thin, and there's not much of a crunchy texture. Otherwise, these are good chips and well worth trying out."
1093,1093,1093,1094,5,"I am from Michigan but have a vacation home in Canada. I have always been a fan of the primarily Canadian product ""ketchup chips"". Uncle Rays is a brand I've seen around there frequently. Since this is such a hard to find product I expected to pay big bucks to buy it online. Imagine my surprise when I found these chips on Amazon for a little over a dollar a bag- CHEAPER than the retail I would pay in Canada. Unbelievably delicious! Ps. The dill pickle chips are really good too :)"
1094,1094,1094,1095,5,Mine came with stickers to sell them for $1.59 but they cost more like $1.25 so if for retail that is not much of a mark up. I bought these for myself so that doesn't really matter and they are cheap. Similar to Lay's but cheaper. Unlike other knockoffs these seemed to taste fresher and the convenient size minimizes stale chips. Great product. Great price.
1095,1095,1095,1096,5,"I'm not a potato chip addict, but sometimes like them as a snack.<br /><br />I chose these because I'd never tried them before.<br /><br />They are delicious, zesty, slightly sweet and spicy.It's like a combination of sweet and tart at once. The oils in these chips are better for health. It is hard to put the bag down.<br /><br />They are made in Detroit Michigan and contain no trans fats, that's good enough for me. Try them."
1096,1096,1096,1097,5,"These are some of my favorite chips on the planet! They are light, crisp, & not too greasy. The flavor is very Dilly. Love that! Great chips. Just hard to find."
1097,1097,1097,1098,5,"These chips are really good. They taste better than other name brands. They're cheaper too!!  They aren't too salty like other brands. The flavors blend really well. Just the right amount of sour cream and onion flavor with a little salt mixed in. Once I start eating them, it's hard to stop!! LOL<br /><br />I will definitely be buying these potato chips rather than another name brand. Not sure if I can state the name brand or not. :)"
1098,1098,1098,1099,3,"4 bags of chips were open when I received the shipment. I am hoping that the chips were<br />blew open during shipment in flight.  No more chips for me through Amazon.  Otherwise,<br />the chips are good to eat and very salty."
1099,1099,1099,1100,5,"Not as thick as kettle chips we have had in the past, definitely more like a potato chip and the college crowd loves it.  Interestingly enough they feel more 'gourmet' when eating these. The flavor is not heavily garlic while you can easily taste the cheese."
1100,1100,1100,1101,1,"We have ordered Uncle Rays BBQ chips many times before. Always been pleased, except this order!  Just NOT the same<br />Seasoning as usual. Generally lacked much for taste! Not sure if they have reduced the seasoning, in their processing? But out of case we bought, we have opened and thrown away 3 bags already, VERY disappointed with this order!"
1101,1101,1101,1102,1,"I have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since I was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in Canada. This is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available. I recently got back from a trip to Montreal, where I ate at least a pack a day. I decided I really wanted some around and was happy when I found these on Amazon. Unfortunately, the flavor is nowhere close to the brands I've tried before. There's a sort of smoky, barbeque sauce thing going on. Not that they're as good as BBQ potato chips (which I love), they just don't taste like ketchup. I tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me, then just threw them all out. Yuck!"
1102,1102,1102,1103,5,"I thought they were very good chips, delicious!  and as soon as i run out, i'll be ordering more very soon."
1103,1103,1103,1104,2,"After reading all the good reviews on these chips I have to admit I was disappointed. Perhaps I just ended up with a bad batch, but I could barely taste the vinegar and there seemed to be far too many burnt (and I mean BLACK) chips in these bags. Hopefully the other flavors are better, but I'm going to stick with other brands from now on."
1104,1104,1104,1105,5,"These are hard to find, but worth the trouble.  Very tasty and very reasonably priced.  Love the product, and received very quickly."
1105,1105,1105,1106,5,"I love uncle ray's potatoe chips. They have alot of spice on each chip.  They taste spicy with a tang of sweet. When I order a box, I pass them out to friends who love them. My husband, my kids and I eat a whole bag at a time.  I limit myself to ordering only twice ayear. The salt content makes me blow up, but I still love them."
1106,1106,1106,1107,4,"I LOVE Old Dutch Ketchup chips but they are no where to be found in the US and pricey on eBay.  I tried Herr's but they were dull - very ketchupy but not the tangy-vinigary ketchup bite that Old Dutch has (makes your mouth hurt  in a good way if you eat too many!).  Uncle Rays are decent - more of a kick - many ""loaded"" chips which I like, still, not the addictive bite I love.  So - if you love Herr's these may be too much for you.  If you love Old Dutch give these a shot.  I am still on my quest for something equal to Old Dutch!!"
1107,1107,1107,1108,5,"I confess, I was originally looking at a different ""name"" brand, but they were out of the salt and vinegar, which is the only flavor I eat.  I had never even heard of Uncle Ray's, let alone tried them, but the price was reasonable and it helped me qualify for free super saver shipping.  I am happy to say I was very pleasantly surprised with these chips.  Somehow or another, even though they just seem to be in a normal box, when I opened that first bag I had a nice mix of big chips and little chips.  The salt and vinegar blend well, so much so that the flavors sometimes sneak up on you-- it sometimes seems that with the first crunch you taste salt and the second crunch gives the vinegar.  In any case, they're terrific.  I was a little reluctant about buying a somewhat large quantity of an unknown product, but I'm very glad I took the chance."
1108,1108,1108,1109,5,"It's difficult to purchase ""no-salt"" potato chips at most retail stores, so I ordered a case of 3 ounce bags of Uncle Rays.  They are great.  Not oily and they taste great.  You get the potato flavor instead of just salt.  I'll be buying these from now on!"
1109,1109,1109,1110,4,"We can rarely find these potato chips where we live, so I decided to find them online to satisfy our cravings. We cannot be happier with the ordering from Amazon! The chips arrived fast and in a box that protected them from crushing. Excellent and will be ordering again!"
1110,1110,1110,1111,1,These had heat and had good enough coating of the seasoning. The first 2 cases were amazing best i had ever. Then they restocked and tried 4-5 cases and they taste either like plain chips or slight hint of seasoning on them. What a shame they seemed to cut back on quality to save money. Bad Uncle Ray!
1111,1111,1111,1112,2,"The flavor combination of the ketchup chips was very good.  However, the coating was applied so heavily that the chips were gritty, and thickly encrusted with it. The flavoring grit coated my lips and mouth with grit and crumbled and fell off all over my clothes.  Messy and unpleasant.  Needs lighter flavor coating."
1112,1112,1112,1113,3,"The Uncle Ray's BBQ Potato Chips are comparable to Lays or most commonly available chips in local markets.  The BBQ spice ia a bit too much; the one pound bags consisted of about half broken chips.  I won't think about buying these again, even with the discounted price and will pay a bit more for a much better kettle fried potato chip."
1113,1113,1113,1114,1,"Bought Uncle Ray's Wavy's 16 oz potato chips because purchased  Uncle Ray's 16 oz barbque potato chips in the past and was very pleased. Oh how wrong we were.  Do not purchase the Wavy's chips!!!!!!!!!!  They are the quality of buying a no name bag of chips from a roadside service station store; broken, brown, very poor quality.  Very, very disappointed.  DO NOT.......DO NOT......DO NOT purchase Uncle Ray's 16 oz Wavy potato chips<br /><br />OCTOBER 03, 2012<br /><br />Bought Uncle Ray's sour cream and onion flavored chips for the 5th shipment with extreme disappointment. The other (4) four shipments were very good which is why we continued to buy this flavor.<br /><br />The additive that when you like an item and start to buy a lot, it will change for the worse is proving to be true for us.  This shipment of chips are awful.  Bags are extremely deflated, so was expecting to be stale; however, was not so - cannot not explain the semi-flat bags.  Chips seem to be the bottom of the barrel flakes.  You know when you try to salt your food and the top comes off, the seasoning on these chips is like that.  It appears that the top came off a full bottle or these are the bottom of the barrel crumbled chips where the seasoning has covered the chips too, too much. .  We just opened (3)three bags just now because the first bags was awful, opened second bag - awful, opened 3rd bag - also was awful.  LEFT WITH 6 MORE ,PROBABLY NOT EDIBLE, BAGS. THE CHIPS REALLY APPEAR TO BE THE NOT SO FRESH, BURNED/BOTTOM OF THE BARREL, GET RID OF LEFTOVERS.  VERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTED.  WILL NOT BUY AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1114,1114,1114,1115,4,"I have now tried both the Ocean Fish and Tuna and the Duck and Chicken variety of this food.  My cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better, but I will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits he's gotten (especially from the ocean fish and tuna) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding.  Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.  (In case you are wondering, it is approximately 4 to 6 whole pea/1.5 pea size potato? bits per 1/4 to 1/2 can.)"
1115,1115,1115,1116,5,Who doesn't like vegetables that are portable and at a great price?  Can't beat the convenience at about 4 cents per package!
1116,1116,1116,1117,5,"Everything AmeriColor that I have purchased works great! I was looking for some lighter tone colors, everything I had was pretty bright. These sheen colors are light with a pretty sheen, it's great! Thank you!"
1117,1117,1117,1118,5,"I love the metallic and sheen colors.  In a photo, the items airbrushed with the silver and gold look real.  The sheen really kicks the color up a notch."
1118,1118,1118,1119,5,ordered these for my daughters wedding cake overnight so that i would get them the next day<br />they came four days after wedding<br />but they are nice
1119,1119,1119,1120,3,"Just in case, if anyone doesn't know what WHITE tea is, as opposed to green or black, let's quote Wikipedia: ""white tea is fast-dried, while green tea is roasted in an oven or pan (while kept moving for even curing). Oolong and black teas are fermented before curing."" What does it mean? For me, it translates into my favorite beverage to start the day with and to keep me going through the day. Objectively and scientifically speaking, white tea is said to have more anti-oxidants and less caffeine so, in my view, it's overall better than coffee or the black or green varieties.<br /><br />This particular product, while it comes in tea bags, it's not exactly your 'supermarket' variety. Unlike the cheap teas, black, green, herbal or white that are delivered crushed inside paper bags, the 'Choice' brand is delivered in pyramid shaped, biodegradable, nylon-like bags that ensure that what you get is actual leaves, not some indistinct crushed powder.<br /><br />This being a white tea, 'delicate' and 'subtle' and the required adjectives to use but they may not apply in this case. I found the added flowers to be a little too strong, bordering to overpowering for my taste. The Lychee and Osmanthus aromas can be an acquired taste - think of sweet, green apples for an equivalent more familiar aroma. If it's not 'love at the first sip', give it some time and you may not only tolerate it but prefer it to other flavors. Or not.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />- organic, fair trade certified White Tea<br />- natural Lychee flavor<br />- organic Osmanthus flavor<br />- contains caffeine<br /><br />The somewhat off-balance added flavors and the premium price are not likely to turn me into a repeat customer. Time will tell but at this time 3 stars (meaning 'it's Okay') seem to be the fair rating."
1120,1120,1120,1121,4,"As soon as I opened the teabag envelope, the smell was truly Divine Nasal Candy :-).  As good as the bag and the lingering scent on the envelope smelled, the tea proved to be rather bitter.  I may have steeped it too long, so will see if the bitterness abates steeping less.  However, as I prefer milk or cream products in flower teas, the bitterness was soon dispelled with a little soy creamer and an enjoyable cup was had.  Lychee is truly a wonderful flavor for tea.  I suspect the flowers added to this lychee tea may contribute to the bitterness in the straight tea.  Will definitely reorder."
1121,1121,1121,1122,5,"If you're looking at Choice tea, you're probably already aware that this extraordinary company was a pioneer in the use of organic, fair trade ingredients for tea.<br /><br />But Choice is also innovative both in design and in creative ingredient combinations. As for design, Lychee White is part of Choice's new line, characterized by an innovative biodegradable pyramid-shaped tea bag which allows for the use of regular loose tea leaves. As for creative ingredient combinations, this healthy white tea is enhanced by the ethereal marriage of natural lychee flavor and sublime organic osmanthus blossoms. The flavor and scent is one to savor and celebrate."
1122,1122,1122,1123,5,"Sent very prompty, tea is delicious, will continue to use this company with great enthusiasm."
1123,1123,1123,1124,5,I loved this tea! It is refreshing and delicious with or without sweetener. A great buy! I would definitely recommend this product!
1124,1124,1124,1125,5,"3 boxes, under $6 each for all cherry - great buy.  I couldn't find all cherry in the store and don't really care for the other flavors."
1125,1125,1125,1126,4,Almost 150 Charms Blow Pops for less the 10 cents each.  These are great for bribing my children and a trip down memory lane.
1126,1126,1126,1127,1,"Be careful!  I ordered a pack of 6, my invoice says pack of 6, but I received only 1 stick."
1127,1127,1127,1128,1,"Even though the item says ""Pack of 6,"" I only received one. I called them up to see where the other 5 were, and they said that Amazon put it incorrectly. Seriously?? They are issuing a refund, but still. I wanted 6, which is what the item says, and instead and only getting the 1. Should we just not trust what's on Amazon now???"
1128,1128,1128,1129,4,this salsa is definitely one for the books!! A perfect blend of the jolokia pepper and seasonings that made this the perfect dip for half-time.. Grown men crying because it's soooo hot is a small price to pay for this awesomeness in a jar... perfect for my cream cheese dip too! A+ across the board.
1129,1129,1129,1130,4,"This salsa was delicious. It was very spicy as I'm sure you've guessed, but was also pretty dang tasty. It was a bit sweeter than I prefer my salsa and given the price I don't think it is something I would eat with any frequency but definately worth the novelty and if sweet and spicy salsas are your thing, you just might end up loving it!"
1130,1130,1130,1131,5,"Nice combination of ingredients so that it is VERY hot, yet still has great flavor. It has a little added sugar, which adds a nice bit of sweetness to the mix. For the hotter salsas, you really can't go wrong with this. This is one of my top four favorites, which include Mrs. Renfros hot salsa, Screaming Sphincter and Pain is Good #37."
1131,1131,1131,1132,5,"I am very acustom to spicy foods and this has a very rich flavor. Half the bottle was devoted to given people my ""not so hot salsa "" reactions amazing . Worth the money! as for me eating it the title says it all"
1132,1132,1132,1133,5,"My cats (7 of them) love this food so I was glad to see Amazon is carrying it again. The local stores do not carry a 15 lb bag, only the 3.5lbs and 12 lbs. This food is sealed very well, and is fresh. I have tried expensive brands and really cheapo brands of cat food, and so far 9 lives agrees very well with my cats. This food does not ""rifle"" through them or cause overly offensive litter pan odors (like cheapo cat food) and their digestive and urinary tracts are all healthy. My cats ages range from 3 years to 18 years old, and believe me, this 9 Lives brand and flavor are something they all like. The price is a really good deal especially for prime as the shipping is free.<br /><br />I also buy the Iams in the orange bag for my cats for a variety and putting some of that in a bowl dry as well as wetted down with water in another bowl is something they really love. Again, no intestinal issues or litter pan issues as they have been eating this combination for several years now.<br /><br />If you do try this, or switch your cat(s) over, be patient as it may take a week or so for your cats digestive system to adjust. In the end, I think you will be very pleased with the quality and price.<br /><br />Also, we used to take in foster cats, and fed them this 9 Lives brand, and they all did very well."
1133,1133,1133,1134,5,my cats favorite cat food he is very pickey and will not eat a lot of different cat foods but he loves this one
1134,1134,1134,1135,5,"I used to buy this at Target but it's cheaper at Amazon.<br /><br />My cat goes crazy when I get out the bag so I know she loves it. Cheap to boot, also!<br /><br />I don't really stress out about which exact ingredients are in cat or dog food. I figure it's all pretty decent so why not save a little money..."
1135,1135,1135,1136,5,"There are 4 kittens that started hanging outside the house and I started feeding them.  Rather than buying the smaller bags, this is a great value for multiple cats.  The kittens love the food and always look forward to eating it.  Shipped right to your door.  Can't go wrong with that!"
1136,1136,1136,1137,4,"I purchase 2 15 pound bags of 9 Lives Daily Essentials a month for my daughter's cats. They love it. She says they often gather around the carton and wait for her to open it. They know what's in there and can't wait for it to be opened. If the cats love it, we love it. Isn't that how it goes?"
1137,1137,1137,1138,5,My cats love this food. For the money it is a great product. I get it every month.  The cats love the flavor.
1138,1138,1138,1139,3,"As the ingredients contained in this food are not the optimal food sources essential to a cat's well being, I don't actually feed my cats this dry food.<br /><br />Corn is the first ingredient, which is a food my cats really don't crave.  There is a meat source as the second ingredient, but unfortunately, it is a by-product.  Although there are a couple of other meat sources listed in the ingredients, the addition of artificial preservatives and coloring make this cat food a less than desirable food staple for any cat.<br /><br />However, the Amazon price is good and with Amazon prime 2-day free shipping directly to work, this is a very convenient food for the shop cats I feed.  While the ingredients aren't the best, feeding it along with canned food, it is a balanced diet and seems to keep the shop cats healthy."
1139,1139,1139,1140,5,"I have 6 feral cats that I trapped, neutered/spayed and released.  They still hang around our property so of course we feed them.  They really like 9 lives and I believe it is good for them.  Being old and my husband handicapped, it is so easy for us to have it delivered right to our door step instead of wrestling with the bags at the store and unloading when we get home.  I am very satisfied with the product and Amazon.  The subscribe and save option is even better as I don't have to remember to order it."
1140,1140,1140,1141,5,My two cats love this cat food more than the kirkland signature brand.  It's also very cheap and affordable cat food at walmart. I would recommend this cat food over meow mix or friskies any day.  Get 9lives dry cat food.  It's one of the better brands out there.
1141,1141,1141,1142,5,One of my kitties is a complete snob when it comes to food and she loves this. Great product to buy.
1142,1142,1142,1143,1,"My cat will NOT eat this food. I don't know why, but it was a waste of money. I was looking for something cheap so I guess you get what you pay for."
1143,1143,1143,1144,5,i love these pop.  these are rather small pops about 1/2 the size of a tootsie pop.  they come in many flavors.  i think this bag is great in the long run.  300 just think Halloween.
1144,1144,1144,1145,5,dum dum lolly pops are the best! they come i lots of kinds and tast really good!
1145,1145,1145,1146,5,"This stuff is great if you're looking for a non-alcoholic vanilla extract...yes this is really a vanilla extract not just a flavor like the essence stuff. I read somewhere on the net that the only reason they can't call it an extract is because it wasn't extracted by alcohol so legally they have to call it a flavor.<br />The smell and color are gorgeous plus its fair trade certified, the texture is a little bit like honey, I think it's the glycerin.<br /><br />Going to buy again for sure."
1146,1146,1146,1147,5,"Not paying attention, I thought this product was simply vanilla extract when I purchased it, tried it in my coffee, and got a shock. Yummy!  I had to go examine the bottle, and realized my yummy mistake.  I wonder what glycerin is, what it's made of...? is it a fat?<br />At any rate, it is delicious!"
1147,1147,1147,1148,2,I like the fact that this vanilla flavor has no alcohol in it so i could add it to my baby's pancakes.  It does not taste the same to me as the regular stuff.  It is rather bland in my opinion.
1148,1148,1148,1149,5,"I prefer the taste of this over the alcohol-based vanilla extracts, particularly in uncooked items and beverages. It has a fairly thick/syrupy consistency."
1149,1149,1149,1150,5,"Raw, Organic, Fair Trade, Tastes Great... What's not to love? My hope is that as more people buy their amazing chocolates that the price will come down a bit."
1150,1150,1150,1151,1,"I just received these bricks today and was very disappointed to find that BOTH of the bricks were broken and unusable as a serving/cooking plate.  They were busted completed in half. They were packaged in one sleeve of small bubble wrap in a shallow box with no other protection or packaging in the box.  I went online to try and return them and they are not eligible for return.  This is the first return I've ever tried to do in over 7 years of purchasing items off of amazon (to the tune of several orders a month!) and yet the one time that I want to return a defective product, I can't do it.  I will be much more careful about what is eligible for returns and what isn't in the future."
1151,1151,1151,1152,5,"Excellent in cereal, or on top icecream sundae. I use them in my ramen noodle hot/sour soup as well.  very very GOOD.  almost a lite peanut flavor.  not too much salt, very lightly seasoned. a must try for anyone wanting a low calorie addition of protien into diet.  even the dog loves them. thinks they are some special treat."
1152,1152,1152,1153,1,"Items in this Gift Basket was delivered to people who called me to say ""could not eat any of it, because everything was old and stale.""  I was sad and disappointed. Time and effort, as well as money to get this, only to find out - terrible."
1153,1153,1153,1154,1,Very disappointed with purchase.  The dates were so dried up where it tasted like leather instead of dates.  Must have been sitting there for a long long time.
1154,1154,1154,1155,2,"I ordered three of the trays (being a date nut) and found that two were old or stale. I admit to not checking the out-of-date on the exterior package, but still - dried out fruit.?! The last tray was fresher, but the experience was soured at that point. I'm disappointed."
1155,1155,1155,1156,1,"Buying this product seems to be almost literally like rolling the dice in a game of craps!<br /><br />My experience with this seems to be similar to the experience of ""Peter R."", unfortunately.<br /><br />The price was excellent.  I ordered mine after the date of "" J. Robert Bois'"" positive experience / review was written but before the date of ""Cindy 2366's"" positive experience / written review.  I bought these & gave them to my Dad, as he *LOVES* dates.  I noticed when I was visiting him, the dried fruit basket was hanging around in his 'fridge a lot longer than any other date basket I had ever ordered for him.<br /><br />Finally I asked him about them.  He said that he did not want to be rude to me or hurt my feelings but....  the dates, well, he was wondering if he should try & eat the seeds in the center & see if they were soft, because the dates themselves were hard as a rock & tasted stale.  I was mortified to say the least...  Then he wanted to know (jokingly) if he had done something to make me mad & I bought these for him as his punishment.  (No, but I had to laugh when he asked about that.)<br />Me personally, I have not tried them.  I will take his word for it!  :)<br /><br />I told him to throw it away or put it out for the squirrels.  After a week of offering the dates,  I picked them up out of his backyard and threw them away.  The squirrels, opossums, & raccoons declined to dine on the dates.<br /><br />It seems to be hit or miss with the ""Broadway Basketeers Irish St. Patrick's Dried Fruit Gift Basket"" purchase.<br /><br />I will not say flat out ""NO!  Do Not Purchase This Item, It is Not Good!""  That is a choice you will have to make on your own.  I just wanted to pass along my experience with the gift basket.<br /><br />Thank Goodness I caught it when it was on special & did not have the full current purchase price invested in the box!  I would have been really sad then!<br /><br />Amazon, as usual, did a fabulous job with the shipping, packaging, and they arrived quickly, in the time frame advertised / promised.<br /><br />Best of luck & I hope others have better experiences than my Dad / I had!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004134H9W"">Broadway Basketeers Irish St. Patrick's Dried Fruit Gift Basket</a>"
1156,1156,1156,1157,5,"Bought this for my mom for her birthday, she was dying to open it so we could all try it. It was nice and fresh and everything tasted great! Wish I had bought one for myself!"
1157,1157,1157,1158,5,"These dates were absolutely delicious. I was a little bit worried because the one product review that it had was only one star. But as I looked at all the other date reviews, the trend seemed to be bad reviews in the Fall timeframe. I had these delivered mid-January and must say they were quite exquisite. Many thanks for a great treat at a large dinner party."
1158,1158,1158,1159,3,This tea is a new flavor of black tea by Tazo. It's better than some other brands but not even close to beIng as good as their old flavor of black tea with citrus (which they took off the market). I don't think this tea is worth sending away for because you can buy it locally in most grocery stores.
1159,1159,1159,1160,4,"Expensive, but worth it, and Ive tried every Iced tea out there. Lipton is pretty good too, but this is the best!! Tetleys sux, and many other Iced teas like Bigelow are terrible, but this is great! Like the coffee shop"

1161,1161,1161,1162,1,This vendor is unscrupulous. She ripped off her cultures from other collectors and shamelessly claims them as her own. She has no conscience and I would highly recommend that you do your purchasing elsewhere.
1162,1162,1162,1163,5,I have used your product for years and find myself in a town where they are sold only in very small bottles.  I am used to buying your product by the half gallon and would like to make my purchases online.  I have tried using other products which pale in comparison to your Original Barbecue Sauce.
1163,1163,1163,1164,5,"If you like soft licorice, these cats aren't for you.<br /><br />A perfect anise-y balance of salty and sweet, these little licorice kitties are perfect! You pop one (or several) in your mouth and let them melt a bit before you embark on your flavorful chewy journey.<br />Hard exterior. Lasts forever if you suck on them. Everlasting licorice Katjes!!<br /><br />Very fresh. Super fast shopping too. Thank you guys!"
1164,1164,1164,1165,3,"After searching for a more constant and less expensive supply of ""real"" licorice over my favorite (more about that later), I decided to try this one based upon other reviews and the description. I have to say that I was disappointed. It is not intense enough and a bit too salty for my preference since all that I noticed was salt and more salt until it got down to the licorice flavor which I would charactize as ""modest"". My all time favorite licorice was discovered years ago while visiting a St. Louis mall has been and remains an excellent choice made by Bissinger's Chocolate Company and they call it French Long Licorice. It is not noticeably salty and packed with flavor without being a sicky-sweet candy. I say that and caution licorice lovers to know their favorite ""type"" of licorice; this is important when reading reviews and purchasing. I was looking for something not American-style junk candy, with actual licorice extract not anise, chewy, lasting, with true strong licorice flavor and no other flavor overtones.<br /><br />As far a Bissinger's is concerned, they do not make this licorice year round nor advertise it on their website or in their catalogs so you have to call their toll free number and ask if it has been in production. It is expensive but well worth it for excellent flavor and lasting ability (I can enjoy one for at least 15 minutes if I don't chew). These are my favorite thing to have when reading a great book and I limit myself to 2 at a sitting for my ""fix""; okay, sometimes 3 if it is a superb book:D.<br />The last time I ordered it they were generous and added a pound of their premium chocolate as a thank-you for being a customer that troubled to find their particular product because I do not live near one of their stores and unless I visit say St. Louis (where it is headquartered) I have to mail-order.Anyway, I prefer my licorice hard and let it soften in my mouth so when I get an order ($56 for 2lbs) I leave it out lightly wrapped for a few days to harden off. That makes it last longer in my mouth and does not affect flavor but that it personal mouth feel preference. It frezes without problems so I will just have to go back to that and pay for my pleasure and stock up :). Licorice-gotta have it!"
1165,1165,1165,1166,5,Very firm small pieces with an intense licorice flavor. I love black licorice and have been trying different gluten free options. I will be ordering more of this one.
1166,1166,1166,1167,2,"I don't know whether it was a fault in the packaging or if they were just past their prime, but they were rock hard and the flavor was not strong enough."
1167,1167,1167,1168,1,"This was a disappointment.  I use other products from this line/manufacturer on a regular basis.  I bought this item as a convenience to carry liquid Stevia in my purse.  The first time I went to use it, the liquid was a dark color...almost black..and I had to throw out the latte I was trying to sweeten.  All the manufacturer's other liquid products are clear, and, in fact, this is titled ""clear liquid"".  It must have been outdated/spoiled. I had already thrown the packing out, so don't know how it was dated.  I tried calling the Amazon supplier, but the call rolled into voice mail.  It's not enough money to spend time following-up, but it was disappointing."
1168,1168,1168,1169,3,Cans are lined w/ material that contains BPA which means the effort to grow the tomatoes organically was a waste of time.<br /><br />12-5-10  I didn't see the liner when I opened a different can from the same case.  I'm scratching my head.
1169,1169,1169,1170,5,"These tomatoes taste like home canned. When summer is over and heirloom tomatoes no longer are available at the farmers market, these serve as an excellent reminder of the past season and a promise of the next. I originally bought these organic tomatoes for my stepfather, whose heart disease dictated a low sodium diet. And they are incredibly low in sodium. But I soon bought them for myself after I tried them just once. When the local organic grocery store and then Sprouts stopped carrying them, I turned to Amazon for a case. They are as much a staple in my pantry as olive oil."
1170,1170,1170,1171,5,"the ingredients are simple and pure and one of the few brands that does not add unnecessary additives.  Generally I like to make my own sauce from scratch, but this is my second choice if I am short on time.  Its taste good and not artificially sweet.  I love the bionaturae products including the tomato paste."
1171,1171,1171,1172,5,"These are the best canned tomatoes I have tasted. They have a fresh flavor, similar to home-canned. This is my second time buying a set. They are a little more acidic/bright, and have a rounder flavor than other tomatoes. Comes with a basil leaf in each can. Note, the 28 oz tins are a better value than the 14 oz ones."
1172,1172,1172,1173,4,"These arent diced, its just mush, But I like the no bpa and would buy again for that reason- but dont expect diced."
1173,1173,1173,1174,5,"Well one of my friends asked for a really big bag of gummy bears, she was very pleased when she opened the box. Than her co-worker really like these gummy bears to."
1174,1174,1174,1175,5,I have been eating these since about 5 years old and are my favorite chips in the world! just dont eat too many of them!
1175,1175,1175,1176,5,"I love these chips and couldn't contain my happiness when I recieved my box!! Love them, if you love spicy foods...get these!!"
1176,1176,1176,1177,1,"I ordered these lollipops for a friends Wizard of Oz themed shower. The arrived packaged well but I noticed the box said they're from ""Oriental Trading Company"".  If I wanted a cheap product that I knew was low quality and from China then I would have bought them directly from their site at $7 for 38 of them!!! However, from the picture these looked well made. The picture is very deceiving and so is the description. They show 16 same-colored lollipops...mine came in a variety of colors. They also gave dimentions that the lollipops were 6""x2"". I noticed they looked a bit small and when I measured they didn't even come to 5"" long, not any of them...even though they're all differnet lengths.  This was very disappointing since I planned to stand them up in a vase of lemon drops. Overall, I'm very disappointed in this product and the seller for not being honest about the product they're providing to consumers."
1177,1177,1177,1178,1,"I purchased these to give to children who come to my place of business.  When they arrived, it says clearly on the back of the individual wrapper ""MADE IN CHINA.""  NO WAY I'm giving these to children if they were manufactured in China, following the whole poisoned pet food debacle.  The fact that these are made in China needs to be highlighted much more clearly."
1178,1178,1178,1179,3,"I ordered 48 lollipops to use as party favors only to be disappointed that the front and back of the candy had writing on it. So I rewrapped them using clear bags purchased from Michaels. Also a few were cracked or broken, so luckily I ordered more than enough. Unwrapped they are so adorable!"
1179,1179,1179,1180,5,I used these and a bunch of other colored lollipops for a friend's birthday and she got a kick out of it.  She had been complaining about feeling old so we threw a kid themed party.  She had a great time.  I don't think it's possible to eat one of these spiral lollipops without feeling like a kid!
1180,1180,1180,1181,5,I used these lollipops for a candy princess costume for my daughter. They came in perfect condition and exactly like the picture shows. They do come in a group of 16...such a great value! I was extremely satisfied!
1181,1181,1181,1182,1,"I purchased these for my candy buffet at my wedding and I'm not impressed at all. I could have saved money by ordering them directly from Oriental Trading Company which is clearly where they came from. they look cheap and they're not as colorful as shown in the picture. the Oriental Trading Company information is on the back of the wrappers on the lollipops. most of the lollipop sticks are bent and two lollipops arrived broken. the box only has 12 lollipops, but in the description it says there's 16. I would have expected that if I knew they were coming from Oriental Trading Company, but that's not in the description, so I feel ripped off."
1182,1182,1182,1183,5,"I had purchased these to go along with a Candyland costume for Halloween.  They shipped quickly and were packaged securely with bubble wrap.  None of the lollipops were broken in transit.<br /><br />It turns out the costume I ordered (from another seller) didn't fit at all and was made of very cheap material so I couldn't even alter it to fit.  Since I had to return the costume, I requested to return these as well.  I was immediately fully refunded without even being asked to ship the lollipops back, so the five stars are so the amazing service.<br /><br />Now I think we'll hand out the lollipops with the rest of our Halloween candy, which I think the kids in our neighborhood will love!"
1183,1183,1183,1184,5,I bought these lollipops for my daughter's 3rd Birthday. They are super cute and the kids loved them. Definitely met my expectations.
1184,1184,1184,1185,5,I got these for my sons 3rd birthday. I got it because I am doing a candy station for his birthday & I wanted to put colorful lollipops as part of the candy station. So this is just perfect for my idea.
1185,1185,1185,1186,1,"These lollipops are not as pictured. They came in assorted colors, some really drab, not the rainbow brights shown in the picture. They are also completely flat rather than being the rolled old fashioned candy style so they look cheap. I need them for a birthday party and I was really disappointed when I received them."
1186,1186,1186,1187,4,"Being the candy-lover that I am, I wanted to buy some cute lollipops that I could pull out of my bag and enjoy whenever I felt like it. For that purpose alone, I'd give them five stars. However- at first lick, the lollipop has a slightly off taste; but this goes away after a minute and is not unbearable or disgusting in any way. I laughed quite a bit at the reviews of outraged individuals because the lollipops are 'Made in China'- I'm not dead/dying/sick. Good enough? As well, the text on the wrapper is fine- I wasn't repulsed by it and I'm not afraid to share. I'd only rewrap them if they were for presentation rather than eating.<br />The colors are not as vivid as in the picture, and the lolipops are not glazed- so they do not have that shiny look that many others have. None of mine came broken, and they were well-wrapped. I'm happy with my purchase and plan on eating them all(minus the few that I share with friends), but I'd try something different next time."
1187,1187,1187,1188,5,"I used this for my daughters candy land birthday party and the kids loved them! They aren't full size, but they are still sooooo cute!!!"
1188,1188,1188,1189,5,Bought these for a birthday and they were perfect--all arrived uncracked and wrapped really well. Super cute and perfect for 4 year olds.
1189,1189,1189,1190,5,"I ordered the lollipops for party favors at my son's 1st birthday party.  The lollipops are 2 inches and I used 1.5 inch ""thank you"" stickers on them.  So cute!  The description states that 16 lollipops are included in the order.  I ordered 2 boxes and only received 12 lollipops in each box.  I contacted the seller's customer service.  I received a response and apology right away.  They promptly corrected the order.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive another full box of 12 and not just the 8 I expected.  The lollipops are wrapped in bubble wrap.  Out of three boxes only one lollipop was cracked.  Not a big deal to me since I did receive an extra box.  Great lollipop at a great price."
1190,1190,1190,1191,1,"I opened this product to find that the lollipops were all broke, I was very disappointed.  They did not package this product in a way that would help keep it from breaking.  You are better off buying them from a store around your area."
1191,1191,1191,1192,5,comical that this is considered a 'toy'.  I bought these as a decoration for a circus themed baby shower and they arrived in perfect condition. I used them in vases surrounded by colored crinkle cut paper and used as centerpieces on the buffet table.  Lots of compliments.  I have kept them and plan to use again for future parties.  these will  not be consumed so no idea how they taste...
1192,1192,1192,1193,4,"Got these as part of a party favor for a rainbow birthday party, so I haven't actually tasted them. The lollipops are cute . . . the wrappers have writing on them, which I wish they didn't (would have been much cuter without the writing). They are a bit smaller than I expected (just slightly larger than a regular lollipop), and a few arrived broken, but really, they were well packaged, and looked cute for the party."
1193,1193,1193,1194,5,"These arrived securely packaged, not even a chip on one lollipop.  They also tasted really good and looked very pretty at my sister's baby shower.  I would buy these again for myself and suggest to future buyers!"
1194,1194,1194,1195,4,"Anyone who has been on a low carb eating program for any period of time will tell you that it gets boring.  We are new to the Dixie Carb Counters line, but I was very pleasantly surprised by the excellent taste.  Some of the other low carb lines (like Atkins) have a terrible aftertaste, or require the user to have a great imagination. (Yes....this is really supposed to be a chocolate bar.)  But the Dixie Carb items are great.  Easy to make, nice portion size, great taste, and no imagination required.  It really is a muffin!  And...no sugar alcohol!  My only issue is that they are a little pricey.  Otherwise perfect!"
1195,1195,1195,1196,4,"I'm going to guess that 'Yuck' didn't mix it up right, because, frankly, these taste surprisingly good considering they're supposed to be lo-carb. They're easy to make, and the non-diabetic in the house thinks they're just as tasty as I do. I do agree that the price is pretty outrageous, though."
1196,1196,1196,1197,1,"This muffin mix is awful,..all you taste is flour and sour cream,.which is used to make these.  It just tastes wierd. I've tried and tried,..<br />there are no good tasting low carb ""treats"",..esp. for diabetics."
1197,1197,1197,1198,5,"I love Salsa and have tried many on the market. I served Dippin Fiesta at a recent Sunday football get together and got rave reviews. Maybe the best Salsa I have ever tasted and served. If you want to taste the best, try this one."
1198,1198,1198,1199,5,"I spent the first five years of my life in Brazil and my American parents both spoke Portuguese fluently and introduced me to Brazilian food and culture. This is one of my favorite foods ever, and the lingering memory I have of Brazil. Fluffy, moist and made out of Tapioca flour, these little rolls are nothing like American cheese bread-- seriously they aren't! Its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven, and they're just as fabulous cold.<br /><br />Yoki is the best maker of the dry mix, and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy, delicious treat or side dish. They never turn out wrong."
1199,1199,1199,1200,5,"I made these recently for a holiday party.  I have never seen anything go so fast!<br /><br />They were very easy to make-- just add a few ingredients, mix, and throw them in the oven.  I will definitely be buying and making these again."
1200,1200,1200,1201,5,"These are not as good at Houston's Samba Grill but they tasted great. The texture is different but in lieu of having these on a daily basis, I have found something that I can make. I would surely recommend these to anyonr."
1201,1201,1201,1202,5,Since being gluten free I've tried all types of GF breads and they are all very expensive. Who knew that the brazilians had the bread game on lock with this inexpensive tapioca version of cheese bread! It's custom which is probably why they are all so skinny! lol But I loved it and will be ordering a whole lot more!
1202,1202,1202,1203,5,My item got to my house on time and I was surprised on how well my package was packed. I recommend this store to anyone;)
1203,1203,1203,1204,3,"These are tiny packets. I bought them thinking they were the regular size and are not. My kids love the product, but this particular package was outrageously expensive for tiny packages. I sent them back."
1204,1204,1204,1205,5,"Despite what some think there is a ton of fillers in here (see the ingredient list on the Omaha site), but.... that is not a bad thing in this case. They are not unhealthy fillers and these are very delicious. Our kids just love them. We serve one ball as a serving as that is the perfect healthy carb portion for a meal. 1 piece has the following nutrition just in case you are wondering:<br /><br />Calories: 120<br /><br />Fat: 4.5<br /><br />Trans Fat: 0<br /><br />Sodium: 270<br /><br />Carbohydrate: 17<br /><br />Protein: 3<br /><br />For our dinners we try to keep our carb side to under 5 fat & 25 carb. This fits perfectly & the taste is superb. Baked in the oven, they come out crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. All with no grease. We now keep these on hand instead of french fries. I know they cost more, but they taste better and they are so much healthier. We wait for one of the sales and buy several boxes at a time."
1205,1205,1205,1206,5,"Perfect year round with just about any meat dish, these Omaha Steaks Twice Baked Potatoes are a gourmet delight. The consistency of the whipped potatoes is smooth and the little bits of bacon, peppers and cheese add to the explosion of flavor.  They cook easily in either the conventional oven, or on the grill when wrapped in foil!  Go ahead, treat yourself!"
1206,1206,1206,1207,1,"For christmas I ordered some coupons from my daughters school for $30.00 off Ohama steaks.  I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.  I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.  Wow Do yourself a favor and spend your money in a good butcher shop of grocery store!!!"
1207,1207,1207,1208,4,"These are actually very tasty.  Pure potatoes with a great texture and no nasty filler ""stuff.""  No bacon, no cheese...just tasty potatoes.  They cook well in either the oven or microwave.  I add a touch of either salt & pepper or fajita seasoning to spice it up.  I rated 4 out of 5 stars because they could be a bit bigger portion.  However, this item is a fairly good value for the money."
1208,1208,1208,1209,3,"These are actually pretty good little potato puffs, and best of all - no CHEESE!  (unless you like that sort of thing, which we don't so it's nice to actually find a potato side dish with no cheese in it).<br /><br />Anyways- - these are surprisingly good and they toast up nicely in the oven in like 10 minutes.  worth it for $10."
1209,1209,1209,1210,4,"They are more potato crockets in the shape of a ball rather than Au Gratin, but nevertheless YUM YUM YUM!"
1210,1210,1210,1211,1,Not happy with the product.  Once they were cooked the potatoes were flat and didn't look any thing like the product picture that was seen.  The shipping cost as much as the potatoes did!
1211,1211,1211,1212,5,I love to order these type of cooked potatoes and they are so great with a steak...
1212,1212,1212,1213,4,I really like this product.  It tasted great and only took a few minutes to make in the microwave.
1213,1213,1213,1214,5,"Very good side dish, easy to make, easy to eat.  As others have said, needs a little spice, but other than that they are delicious!"
1214,1214,1214,1215,5,"excellent - will order again!!  It's nice to be able to order Omaha items from Amazon because Amazon ships SOOO fast, and payments are so convenient."
1215,1215,1215,1216,5,"I was surprised at the size of these potatoes. I have bought them at my local grocery store before and was disappointed that they were so small. These are perfect!! Tasty, cook just right. Love 'em!!"
1216,1216,1216,1217,3,"These potatoes are good.  But i don't know if I'd get them again.  The garlic taste to me was off and strong.  And I LOVE garlic.  Hoping I just got an ""off"" batch."
1217,1217,1217,1218,4,"Excellent and tasty though I thought not enough garlic so I added more. When I order GARLIC I guess I expect more of it.  But perfect if you have guests as it will never offend anyone. Omaha always is sure to do everything to please their customers, a premier company, hard to find anymore."
1218,1218,1218,1219,4,We had these along with Omaha prime rib. Both were great. Two where plenty to fill up. Made them in toaster oven in less then 20 minutes.
1219,1219,1219,1220,4,"I received 4 of these in my first ever Omaha Steaks order that I received today. I wasn't sure what to expect, but so far, I've been pleased. I tore the plastic open, put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350. 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious. The cheese filling was crispy on-top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft. No way would they come out as good if put in the microwave, so I'd say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go. Now, you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what Omaha charges for these alone, but as long as you get a good deal on the Omaha website, these simply make a great addition to any Omaha steaks order. As delicious are they are though, I wouldn't order a box of JUST these off the site due to the added shipping costs. But like I said, as long as they're part of a nicely priced packaged deal, I'll definitely take them. Actually, I probably wouldn't order any packaged deal in the future from Omaha that didn't include these. A big plus, at least for me, is if you check the ingredients list on these, there's no partially hydrogenated oils, so there's no traces of trans fats, which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes. Also no high fructose corn syrup, which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus. If you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example, chances are, the butter used, sour cream, etc. will be full of chemicals, trans fats & high fructose corn syrup. These, not so much. So there is a definite degree of quality with Omahas stuffed baked potatoes. Each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat, which is 42% the DRV, but that's obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon, cheese and sour cream. I was also expecting there to be no fiber, but it turns out there's 3grams of fiber per baked potato half. Another plus. Overall, the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy, being made with quality ingredients."
1220,1220,1220,1221,5,These potatoes are really very good.  My husband and I both *love* them.  And way too easy.  We will be buying more of these.
1221,1221,1221,1222,5,"I got these in the mail today, i know right, sounds so weird to say i got hash browns in the mail, haha.  Come in dry ice cooler and were in box all in their own lil plastic bags.  Just stick them on a baking sheet for 35 min. at 400 degrees.  when you get them out of the oven you smell the cheese and it has nice crunchy outside with creamy potato inside, if you want the best side dish to your steak or other meat, hey could even use for breakfast with some eggs and sausage, your choice, this get a 5/5 for taste, 5/5 for presentation, buy these now, great price too, thanks for your time, and thank you omaha steaks, the best at great prices."
1222,1222,1222,1223,4,"January 3, 2011<br /><br />I purchased these potatoes from Omaha Steaks online last week. I was not sure what to expect ... The au gratin potatoes I had seen and tasted before were sliced potatoes with globbs of gooey cheese sauce, and by the looks of them, this certainly wasn't it ... I opened the box and got out my skillet. The first thing that I noticed is that these things were huge ... like a gigantic tater tot. I browned them on both sides about 10 minutes each. To my surprise, they were very tasty. Texture was light fluffy and the potatoes tasted extra fresh .. not frozen or freezer burned. I liked them alot. I think these are perfect for kids ... none of the flavors were overpowering and great texture ... I give these 4 stars."
1223,1223,1223,1224,5,"So so good!  Delicious, easy to prepare food!  I would definitely order again.  Had a gourmet taste, and took only minutes to get ready.  Yum!!!"
1224,1224,1224,1225,4,I like em but nothing unique about the flavor.  basically saves you from having to make them at home... a little pricey but for a treat what the heck
1225,1225,1225,1226,4,They taste pretty good. I eat one of these with some of the poultry selections from Omaha Steaks. It makes a great meal.
1226,1226,1226,1227,5,These potatoes are pretty good. They can be eaten alone or served with a meal. Really like potatoes and this is an easy choice.
1227,1227,1227,1228,3,"Omaha Steaks 8 (5.75 oz.) Stuffed Baked Potatoes<br /> '''<br />The Stuffed Baked Potatoes were unimpressive and<br />lacking in flavor.<br /><br />I tasted no bacon or chives.<br /><br />However, they do make an attractive addition to a<br />meal."
1228,1228,1228,1229,3,Potatoes were good. Two 12 oz trays will be enough for 4 adults so really not worth the money honestly. $10 for two little trays is a lot even for the ease and quality. Like I said they were good and easy to prepare and thankfully only four of us for x-mas dinner today or I wouldn't have had enough. 24 oz. of potatoes sounds bigger then it is lol. (not Omaha's fault)
1229,1229,1229,1230,5,"I prepare these baked potatoes in a toaster oven. They are the perfect compliment to a hamburger, steak or chicken entree. Try them. You'll like them!"
1230,1230,1230,1231,5,Very good transaction and Omaha food was sent properly.  I already left one feedback.
1231,1231,1231,1232,5,These potatoes are very good along with all their steaks and hamburgers.  I would definately recommend Omaha Steaks to anyone looking for a gourmet dinner at a reasonable price!
1232,1232,1232,1233,5,"I'm a big fan of Outburst Energy Bites, and the peanut ones are probably my favorite. They're reasonably priced and a great snack. Think of peanut M&M's and a coffee all at once. Since they taste so good, it is very tempting to eat the whole box. They claim it's a lot of caffeine, but it doesn't feel like more than a big coffee or a large energy drink, so I usually give in to the temptation!<br /><br />I highly recommend these!"
1233,1233,1233,1234,5,ENERGY BITES F'ING RIP YOUR FACE OFF WITH MOLTEN LAVA ENERGY.<br /><br />INFINITY ENERGY TO THE F'ING MAX.  I ATE A WHOLE BOX ONCE AND THREW A CAR AT A BABY.<br /><br />F'ING RAVE.<br /><br />SERIOUSLY THESE ARE GREAT.
1234,1234,1234,1235,3,a $5000.00 diamond would be cheaper to ship than a $5000.00 car!  I don't buy from any supplier that ships by price.<br />This item is $7.95 then you pay $11.95 for up to $20.00 for shipping? No way I would pay that for one jar.
1235,1235,1235,1236,1,Where's the ingredient list for this product?  Thought all foods were supposed to have it.  Would never buy any food without first knowing what's in it!
1236,1236,1236,1237,5,"I originally found this Roasted Garlic Juice at one of those roadside shops that sell a variety of foodstuffs, plants and ice cream. That was about a year ago and unfortunately, the place is now out of business. I was getting low on it and was glad to find it here on Amazon, as I couldn't find anything even close at any grocery store in a 50-mile radius. Store Managers were saying they never heard of pure garlic juice. I told them if they carried it, they would sell a lot.<br /><br />I have used this product for many dishes and marinades and the flavor can't be beat! It is pungent yet smooth and will bring out the flavor in any meat or dish you can imagine. I prefer the Roasted over the Cold Pressed, but both are great in their own way. It's nice to be able to pour or spray.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you are a garlic lover, buy this!!!!!"
1237,1237,1237,1238,4,"It's a great product- especially if you like garlic! No need for ""slicing & dicing! (Which is a good thing when your right side is ""stroke paralized""!) Just garlic too- not an ""oily & salty product"" Just plain or roasted GARLIC ! And it lasts a long time too!"
1238,1238,1238,1239,5,"I love my garlic spray so much, that i ordered more! I grow garlic, but I don't even bother juicing them anymore, not with this product. There are 150 cloves in every bottle. Thats a lot of yummy garlic..."
1239,1239,1239,1240,5,"I love the taste of real garlic - not the granulated or brined stuff. These are great flavoring agents, especially for popcorn as a liquid in glazes and rubs. Love the choice between roasted and raw, and a little goes a long way. I first bought this product 2 years ago. Despite using one or the other at least once a week, I am only now needing to replace them.<br />Yum!"
1240,1240,1240,1241,5,"I had heard about their prickly pear tea in a forum and decided to try it since I hadn't had any since I was in Arizona.  It was better than I remembered!  I tried it first hot and then used the remainder for ice tea and both were really good.  The company delivered super fast too which was great.  I recommend this tea highly, particularly if you like prickly pear teas."
1241,1241,1241,1242,1,"Loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form.  This tea is black tea with prickly pear ""flavor"". The shipping cost is twice the cost of the tea.  If there is a prickly pear component it is all but undetectable when I drink it. It just tastes like regular black tea.  Very disappointing."
1242,1242,1242,1243,5,"Butternut Mountain Maple Syrup is the real deal. The grade B is wonderful on pancakes, or in coffee- just about on anything you'd like sweetened.<br />Delivery was timely and the product came as expected. I recommend this!"
1243,1243,1243,1244,5,"I just received my shipment and could hardly wait to try this product. We love &quot;slickers&quot; which is what we call them, instead of stickers because they can be removed so easily. My daughter designed signs to be  printed in reverse to use on her car windows. They printed beautifully (we  have 'The Print Shop' program). I am going to have a lot of fun with this  product because there are windows everywhere and other surfaces like tv  screens and computer monitors."
1244,1244,1244,1245,5,This was a really good idea and the final product is outstanding. I use the decals on my car window and everybody asks where i bought the decals i made.  Two thumbs up!
1245,1245,1245,1246,5,"After years of drinking Red Bull, Rockstar, Monster and some others, I have found the holy grail of energy drinks. It kicks in within 2-3 minutes and it lasts an entire work day. After seven hours or so, you gradually come down. There is no anxiety or disphoria when it wears off. You just get very sleepy when you finally rest.<br /><br />Redline Power Rush is the very best product on the market. If it were illegal I would buy it on the black market. 'Nuff said."
1246,1246,1246,1247,5,"The normal 15oz can is too much SPAM for one person.  The 7oz version is perfect for me to make two sandwiches.  I cut the block in half.  Each half I cut into 4 slices.  The 4 slices are perfect to lay on top of a toast.  With some salad green and 2nd toast, it becomes a quick and filling lunch sandwich when I hike or backpack (need sodium to replace electrolyte).  The 2nd half will become my 2nd sandwich if I do overnight backpacking (for dinner)."
1247,1247,1247,1248,5,Our family loves SPAM and Amazon makes it so easy and such a great deal to buy in bulk.  The 7-ounce size is perfect for our use.  Amazing what you can use SPAM for.  Add it to all your favorite recipes in place of other meats!  Super convenient to have it come in automatic shipments without having to give it a second thought!
1248,1248,1248,1249,5,It's a long time since Iv'e eaten Spam but I decided to give it a try. I always had left overs before but with this size can I simply enjoy every bit in one serving.
1249,1249,1249,1250,5,Well worth the price.  Very large chocolate truffles that taste amazing.  Can't wait for Amazon to get them again.  1 January 2012. Just browsed to the truffle page and had a mini heart attack when I saw the price.  They were $12.00 when I purchased them in 2011.
1250,1250,1250,1251,1,"So disappointed with this frosting.  The first time I used this frosting I was disappointed, but a year has gone by and I thought that maybe I had gotten a bad container.  I really should have thought twice about buying it again, but I wanted to give Pillsbury the benefit of the doubt.  Boy was I wrong in doing that.  Both times that I used it, the frosting pretty much 'sagged' off of the cake!  My cakes were definitely cooled.  I had even put the latest one in the freezer to slice into layers.  After thawing it in the fridge, I began to ice it.  Sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake (again)!  This product needs to either be marketed as cupcake frosting, the recipe needs tweaked, or it needs to be pulled off of the shelves all together.  Shame on me for trying it a second time!"
1251,1251,1251,1252,5,Excellent product.  Crab Cakes made with lump style crabmeat has been a family tradition during Christmas holidays for over 40 years.  Local grocery stores do not carry lump style and only offer fancy/minced crab meat which is OK but not as satisfatory as lump style.
1252,1252,1252,1253,3,"I bought this because of the good feedback and bad luck that I have had with canned crab. I was hoping that this product was different than  previous canned crab that I have had. Alas, it is just a little better. Unfortunately, canned crab just seems to be not very good and I have  to stick with fresh expensive crab."
1253,1253,1253,1254,5,THESE TREATS ARE THE ONLY ONES MY 14 YEAR OLD DOG WILL EAT. SHE LOVES THEM.
1254,1254,1254,1255,5,"She will play with it before eating it.  Since she is small it acts like a tiny ball for her.  They are expensive, but less so at Amazon than at a pet store."
1255,1255,1255,1256,5,I have three small dogs and these are one of their favorite treats!  I don't have to worry about them choking and I feel I am giving them a healthy treat!  Please don't ever stop making them Pet N Shape.
1256,1256,1256,1257,5,Terrific with English Triffle.  Beware though the pack of 6; each of the 6 containers makes about a gallon of pudding.
1257,1257,1257,1258,5,"After you've made the customary, authentic English trifle with Bird's custard powder you might not want to go back to the usual grocery-store pudding packages. I DID purchase a large quantity of Bird's custard power, the pack of six, but the packs have a longish shelf life, and I enjoyed sending a surprise pack/container to a friend who is originally from England.<br /><br />At Christmas, I will also include a container of Bird's custard powder to special relatives and friends so they can learn how easy it is to make excellent trifle with this product. For my non-English family and friends, I will include laminated instructions based on my own successes with Bird's custard recipe for trifle.<br /><br />English trifle is so easy to make with the following:  Bird's custard powder, store-bought pound cake, thawed frozen fruit, some sherry wine (or slightly sweetened juice from the thawed frozen fruit) poured over the small slices of cake. For the final touch, add non-dairy whipped ""creme."" Delicious and inexpensive! I highly recommend this product and am so pleased to be able to purchase it through Amazon. And the price for the six  containers is so very reasonable as to almost be unreal. Go for it!"
1258,1258,1258,1259,5,"We found this on our recent trip to England and had to find it as soon as we got home.<br />It's a standard for the Brits, and for us now too.  It's been around FOREVER.<br />You can use it in so many ways; pies, trifle, donuts,<br />cakes, by itself with fresh fruit and whipped cream, or even on french toast!"
1259,1259,1259,1260,5,I am from England and I was raised on this custard. If you like vanilla custard/pudding you will love this. It's rich and creamy and has lots of vanilla taste.  I love that it comes in a big canister and I can make as much as I want to. I would never make a trifle with anything else.
1260,1260,1260,1261,5,"This is a great product, we have made custard with it for years and it always makes great custard. We will purchase this product again. Amazon does a great job of getting us our purchases fast and without damage."
1261,1261,1261,1262,5,life without bird's custard has been hell ! i've tried other varieties-sthg from holland if i recall correctly-just not up to snuff...i ordered 6 to ensure i never run out ! better than ice cream and not half as fattening.
1262,1262,1262,1263,5,I purchased this product because I have previously used it and it is not always easy to locate on store shelves.  I prefer it to other powdered custard(pudding) products for ease of making and taste. It's wonderful in trifles or just about any pudding type dessert you want to make. Amazon gets the product to you almost immediately and at a reasonable price.
1263,1263,1263,1264,5,"Hard to find locally. Great price, especially with the free shipping.  Have enough to share with family and friends."
1264,1264,1264,1265,5,"This is a wonderful and very handy product.  I'm thrilled by all the yummy ways this can be used.  My aunt, who lived in Ireland for 7 years, said they used it all the time and loved it."
1265,1265,1265,1266,5,"I actually use this mix to make vegetable biryani and it works well for this purpose,  with some slight adjustments to the recipe.<br /><br />I do have one caveat about the product, but it's about the recipe given, not the spice mix. I think the amount of ghee it is suggested you use (200 grams) is too much, and you can easily use 100 grams instead. Also, I think it's easier to mix the spices and yogurts first and cover the chicken (or vegetables) with the mix to marinate than to mix it in the pan while frying.<br /><br />To make vegan biryani you can substitute vegetables for chicken, coconut milk for yogurt, and safflower or peanut oil for ghee.<br /><br />Overall this spice mix makes the tastiest biryani I've had outside of a restaurant, and even rivals some of them. And the price makes this an incredible deal--there are 2 bags per package and there are 6 packages, so this makes 12 large batches for ~$13 with free shipping. I will definitely order more when I run out."
1266,1266,1266,1267,4,"I love this tea. It has a mild flavor and no caffeine. The only problem is that the string comes detached from the bag after about a minute in hot water. This doesn't happen once in a while, it happens nearly every time.<br /><br />Triple Leaf Tea, please fix this bag issue. It's frustrating to the point where I may look for a similar tea from another company."
1267,1267,1267,1268,5,"Anytime I have started to get even the slightest sore throat, I drink this and the next morning it's gone. I always bought it at World Market, but they said it has been discontinued. But, thank God for Amazon!"
1268,1268,1268,1269,5,This tea is so helpful for congestion and it tastes great too.  Make sure you let it steep as long as the directions say.  It really seems to help you to feel better.
1269,1269,1269,1270,5,"A friend sent me two boxes of this for Christmas.  I thought it an odd gift, as I can just go out and buy herbal tea.  Shortly thereafter, I was flung into major stress and chaos during an extreme family crisis. I started drinking this tea to help with unexpected stomach pains and it worked!  Not only that, during this time, other family members got physically ill, but I was able to carry on without catching the bug.  Since then, I'm a believer.  I make this as iced tea for daytime and drink a cup at night before bed."
1270,1270,1270,1271,5,"In cold weather, I brew this tea by the pot, keep it simmering, and brew a lemon ginger or ginger lemon tea, by the cup, made with this as the base.  My husband will drink it, and I can't get him to use any other medicinal.  (Hates licorise.)  It helped a great deal last winter."
1271,1271,1271,1272,5,"Have bought this from the folks who prepare it and I must say, this is the absolute best item I have ever tasted. They make this at a farm in Benson, AZ and it tastes like heaven. Highly recommend it for everything...I tend to slice up apples and dip them. Have tried it on toast as well."
1272,1272,1272,1273,5,"I've been feeding liver biscotti for years. I was looking for a healthy treat without additives for my epileptic dog (additives can be a seizure trigger) and liver biscotti filled the bill. The ingredients are top-quality. The bite-size bits are perfect for training and don't muck up your pockets. The bite-size portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds, which is a problem with other treats.  And for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities, there is an anti-allergenic recipe. Enthusiastically recommended!"
1273,1273,1273,1274,4,"This is an excellent training treat for every day.  It's not a ""high value"" treat (used for more challenging training situations) nor is it so bland that it does not serve as an incentive.  It's a good size, though it does make some crumbs.  Plus, ""liver biscotti"" is fun to say!"
1274,1274,1274,1275,5,"My 2 dogs love this treat.  When my oldest (male) was younger, he would sit down, stand up, go down, roll over, etc. and do every trick in his repertoire before I even gave him a command whenever I pulled out a bag of the liver biscotti.  My female also loves this but she's a little less silly.  Also, this has never upset their stomachs nor caused allergic reactions.  I finally had to find a place that sold this in bulk (i.e., 5 lbs. bags) since I was going to the store ALL the time to buy more of these.  I also stuff their Kongs with a combo of these and their regular kibble and some pumpkin and freeze it. I highly recommend this treat."
1275,1275,1275,1276,5,"Five of my five dogs agree - they'd rather munch liver biscotti than almost anything else.  I pull out a treat and they come running.  It cheers 'em up, encourages them to obey, lets 'em know I love 'em, and got me over some really rough training spots with my 90 pound puppy!!!  And in a few instances when I've been slow producing the goodie, they've cornered me and dug in my pocket themselves!  I think it's a hit!"
1276,1276,1276,1277,5,"Our dog loves these treats.  We sprinkle a few into his regular dry dog food, and he gobbles everything up as fast as he can.  We also use them as rewards for good behavior.  Wonderful, nutritious, really good to have on hand at all times."
1277,1277,1277,1278,5,"Lucy loves these treats as does her friend, Daisy - I do not know what else to say to fill up the 210 word minimum."
1278,1278,1278,1279,5,My dog will do anything for these treats. Buying a five pound bag lasts about a year and they are dry so they are easy to put in your pocket and they last forever.
1279,1279,1279,1280,5,"Despite what many say and think about bulldogs, ours are picky about their snacks.  They love the liver biscotti which can be a hand-fed treat or used in a treat ball.  They last longer than most snacks and because our bullies don't often chew their food, these are the perfect size.  I don't feel bad about feeding these either because they are low calorie and without fillers."
1280,1280,1280,1281,5,"Our dog named ""Big Red"" loves your liver biscoti and the closest store was 54 miles round trip. I am not too keen on driving that far so I found your mail service on the internet. Now our 8 pound poodle gets his treats again!"
1281,1281,1281,1282,5,They're perfect training treats for my dogs.  They go to the place where they're stored and stand there until I get a handful for our play games.
1282,1282,1282,1283,5,even my vet approves. these little treats are my dogs favorite. i just get the small ones because i have a small dog.
1283,1283,1283,1284,5,My dogs go crazy over Liver Biscottis. They are nice and crunchy which helps clean their teeth and all the ingredients are wholesome.
1284,1284,1284,1285,5,My dog would have to stop breathing before she would fail to perform for Liver Biscotti. Even my friends with finicky dogs are surprised how their dogs love the stuff.
1285,1285,1285,1286,5,"If there is one thing our dog likes, it is the liver biscotti dog treats.  These make the best rewards and training treats we have used."
1286,1286,1286,1287,5,"As another reviewer mentioned, these treats are CRUNCHY!. I like them for 2 reasons..my dog can't just ""woof them down"", she has to chew them, so they last..and I like that the cruchiness may be good for her teeth. The treats are small, but again, are crunchy...I'm glad I found these. She loves them and I like giving them to her."
1287,1287,1287,1288,5,I have two dogs that absolutely love these treats!  The 5lb bag size that I purchased is very convenient and long lasting.  The vendor that I purchased them from is very thorough; several emails were sent updating me on the status of my order and it's upcoming delivery. The price was extremely reasonable.  The best part is the fact that my pups adore these treats and they are good for them to nibble on throughout the day.  A guilt free doggie reward!
1288,1288,1288,1289,5,Our Portuguese Water Dog has been trained on these bite sized little treats. He loves them and will do anything for them.  Good Dog!
1289,1289,1289,1290,4,"I DON'T MIND PAYING A LOT FOR A QUALITY TREAT FOR MY DOGS AS THESE ARE, BUT I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM IN COMPANIES WHO PRICE GOUGE ON SHIPPING CHARGES.  ITS OBVIOUSLY NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO GET THE AMOUNT OF MONEY (WHICH IS HIGH) FOR THE TREATS THEMSELVES THEY HAVE TO ALSO MAKE MONEY OFF ME FOR SHIPPING CHARGES.  THERE IS NO WAY THAT IT COST THEM $10 TO SHIP A 5LB BAG OF TREATS TO ME.  $6 DOLLARS WOULD BE FAIR AND ACCURATE, THIS IS THE REASON I GAVE IT ONLY 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5"
1290,1290,1290,1291,5,Our four dogs love this stuff! This bite size treat is a perfect size for training. The dogs like the crunch - it's shaped like a small square crouton. There is enough in this huge bag to make little gift bags for friends with dogs.
1291,1291,1291,1292,5,"The ultimate treat for dogs of all sizes.  Our dogs are absolutely crazy for Liver Biscotti.  We love the size of this treat, it makes it very easy to use them as daily treats and not worry that you are over feeding.  The size is also great for using as bait for conformation showing.<br /><br />We love the fact that all natural ingredients with no preservatives are used.  All you have to do is open the bag and smell what's inside.  It smells so good, you might be tempted to try one too.<br /><br />We love the 5 pound bag.  Having multiple dogs, this bag really is a cost saver.  You'll see significant savings over buying the small 8oz bags.<br /><br />It also makes a great gift for your dog loving/owning friends, spread the joy of Liver Biscotti!"
1292,1292,1292,1293,5,"A fantastic product for pet treats,great smell and has freeze-dried liver treats beat by leaps and bounds. Owner of 2 fussy cockers."
1293,1293,1293,1294,1,"This was very pricey for what is essentially a small bag of hard crumbs.<br />Maybe my dog is just spoiled, but she treats these like third class treats- it is definitely on the bottom of the doggie treat hierarchy.  More often than not, she will simply walk away from these.  Glad other people like them, but I will not be buying them again."
1294,1294,1294,1295,5,"OMG these things are delicious!@ I'm not a candy/sweets eater usually.. but ... OhMan! I liked them so much I may have had , two.. oops, now three!"
1295,1295,1295,1296,5,"I was just messing around on amazon when I ran into this add for beer nuts, when I noticed someone had left a review it was pretty funny, being the beer lover that I am, I had to try them,  well they're here now and I cant drink beer without them, they have a story on the back about how the guy got started in the 50's, and soon his beer nuts were in bars around america!  iIcan see why, they're pretty darn good."
1296,1296,1296,1297,5,"i used to eat beer nuts all the time as a kid.  sorta like honey roasted peanuts, but more unique flavor.  if you never tried'em, if you like honey roasted peanuts, you'll love these!"
1297,1297,1297,1298,5,"great product! wish they were still available in bars,pubs,and stores.have given cans to several of my golf buddies and they agree with me. i'm just glad they are still available on line."
1298,1298,1298,1299,5,Some reviewers must have a short memory. I've been eating Beer Nuts since childhood and the ones I ordered tasted like they always have (sweet and salty). Bought them locally until I couldn't find them anymore. Great product and price for 6/12oz cans.
1299,1299,1299,1300,4,"After a second purchase of a 12-oz Beer Nuts Peanuts 6-pack, I can level no complaints. The shipment again arrived without any adverse settling such as clumping inside the cans. Although the flavor may be a bit duller than my abiding childhood memory of them, this may be attributable instead to the diminished taste buds of a middle-ager. Nonetheless, everyone I know who has tried this product likes it.  Either as a stand-alone snack or as an adjunct to a couple of beers, Beer Nuts is a tasty, if understated winner."
1300,1300,1300,1301,5,this is the second time ordering beer nuts....i can not find them anywhere in local stores.  the shipment came (6 cans per order) and 2 cans were damaged.  called amazon customer service and the next day another 6 cans appeared at my door.<br /><br />the nuts are always great (unless can is damaged and nuts are stale) but the customer service was the shining star.  thank you !!  will order again
1301,1301,1301,1302,5,My husband is a Beer Nut lover. Looked in many stores<br />and could only find small bags. Love these large cans.
1302,1302,1302,1303,4,I am 76 years old and I have eaten these nuts for many years.  The ones mailed to me are very tastey.  The only problem is that they were jostled around and a lot of the red skins came off and went to the bottom of the can.  No big deal but it would have been better if they had stayed on the nuts.  I will order from Amazon again.
1303,1303,1303,1304,5,"Not always available at our local stores. I love them. They are especially good watching football games, with you favorite malt beverage. This is a good deal, and super fast delivery, too. The nuts were fresh and tasty, as always."
1304,1304,1304,1305,5,"These are the long time classic.  Not as sweet as honey roasted peanuts, these have just the right balance to go with a nice cold brew.  Amazon's price on these is really great."
1305,1305,1305,1306,2,"I remember well the ""Beer Nuts"" I used to savor. Those were the days of the big 'Redskin' type peanut surrounded with a glaze of honey sweetness punctuated with a salty tang I remember so well. These nuts I now have in the palm of my hand are not reminiscent of ""Beer Nuts"" in any way. Yes, there is a discernible salty taste but the sweetness is more to me imagined than real. Plus, these nuts are simply the common inexpensive 'Spanish peanuts'. In short, I would just ask ""Beer Nuts"" ... 'What happened?'"
1306,1306,1306,1307,1,"I ATE BEER NUTS ALL THROUGH MY CHILDHOOD YEARS AND INTO MY 20'S. AFTER THAT YOU COULDN'T BUY THEM IN UPSTATE NY. WHEN A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE SAID HE WAS LOOKING FOR THEM, I CHECKED OUT THE NET TO FIND THEM ON YOUR SITE.<br />THEY ARE HORRIBLE. WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT. THEY TASTE MORE LIKE SPANISH PEANUTS WITH OUT THE SALT. THE BEER NUTS I REMEMBER WHERE SWEET AND SALTY, JUST LIKE THE LABEL SAYS. THESE PEANUTS ARE BLAND, BLAND, BLAND."
1307,1307,1307,1308,1,"The flavor of the old Beer Nuts is almost entirely gone. The Beer Nuts are now just plain Spanish Peanuts with a slight flavor, hardly noticeable. Extremely disappointing."
1308,1308,1308,1309,1,"It is not the best way to buy Beer Nuts.<br /><br />Perhaps the product had been exposed to high heat and a ""whole lot of shaking"".  Most of the ""coating"" and ""flavoring"" was off of the nuts.  Even though the individual cans are ""sealed"", it is like the nuts had been sitting out in a bowl for a long time on a hot, humid day."
1309,1309,1309,1310,5,"This is the good stuff! I am eating some right now with some sweet basil tomato sauce. This pasta has a neat shape and it cooks up nicely. It's colorful and tasty and is great ""al dente""."
1310,1310,1310,1311,5,"All of the Castellana pastas are absolutely wonderful.  They have a great taste, hold their unique shapes, grab lots of sauce in your dishes, and have a nice ""bite.""  This is a great price for this item!"
1311,1311,1311,1312,5,"*****<br /><br />Oh, I love this pasta! It is thick, chewy, absolutely extraordinary! And made with authentic flavorings to boot! The red are flavored with tomato and red beet powder. The green are flavored with spinach powder and basil powder. The black pastas are flavored with squid ink, the off-white are au naturale. The yellow pasta are flavored with turmeric, the orange with carrot powder. A rainbow of beauty and natural delectable flavor.<br /><br />The pasta are shaped like little cresent moons with a rough exterior to absorb whatever sauce or oil you might use. Because this pasta is so very flavorful, I enjoy it best with a good quality olive oil and some Celtic sea salt. Sometimes I add some tarragon or fresh rosemary, usually not, so I can just savor the pasta alone. It also is excellent with olive oil and fresh grated Parmesan chees on top.<br /><br />With only 1g of fat, 10g of sodium, this can also be a heart-healthy meal. There are 7g of protein and 42g of carbos, no added sugars or preservatives.<br /><br />It is the perfect easy dish to impress company or a date!<br /><br />To be able to buy the best packaged pasta in the whole wide world at HALF PRICE in bulk from Amazon is a wonderful privilege. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />*****"
1312,1312,1312,1313,5,"Yes, it's expensive, but it's worth it!  I have yet to find a marinade that stands up to this one.  Add some crushed garlic, sauteed onions and vegetables of your choice, then mix it all with this sauce and whatever meat you choose (I prefer using the resulting marinade by adding some fresh rosemary and lamb) for two days.  You won't believe the oohs and aahhhs you get at the table...worth every penny!"
1313,1313,1313,1314,5,"It's not a traditional BBQ sauce in terms of flavor, but you could easily use it for that. It's very thick and has a strong hotness (not too hot - but hotter than most spicy BBQ sauce) and it's made from much better ingredients than most BBQ or sweet hot sauces. It tastes very fruity rather than sugary sweet. It would be great on almost anything grilled or stir fried, and it's incredible in pork and beans. Don't let the price scare you away from this outstanding condiment."
1314,1314,1314,1315,5,It's always wonderful to be able to give chocolates as a gift and to receive them.  It's great to know that you can send someone  some chocolates with the guarantee that they don't arrive all melted.  Good Service and Excellent chocolates!
1315,1315,1315,1316,5,We love strawberries dipped in chocolate but locally we could not find the dark chocolate type - so glad we found this at Amazon - it is WONDERFUL!
1316,1316,1316,1317,5,"Best dipping chocolate ever! I dipped strawberries, pretzels marshmallows its wonderful. My whole family loves them. Great to bring out to friends or occasions! Dont forget the wax paper, otherwise it will stick to your plate!"
1317,1317,1317,1318,1,"The current product, ""Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador, sold by SAAQIN"", is of terrible quality. Somehow, reviews for a similar item, produced by ""Alive and Aware"", were associated with this product. The cocoa I received when ordering through this page is made by ""Organic Herbal Essence"". Alive and Aware is delicious; Organic Herbal Essence is not. Another warning: After receiving the 5lb bag of Organic Herbal Essence and hating it, I ordered ""Alive and Aware Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador - 2 Pounds"", shipped by Halaleveryday. I thought for sure I'd get Alive and Aware, given it's in the product title, but Halaleveryday actually shipped me ""Organic Herbal Essence"". Grr."
1318,1318,1318,1319,5,I have tried a couple of different cocao powders but this one is a step above the other ones.  The richness of the bean has a dark smooth flavor within the powder.  It is just a better product
1319,1319,1319,1320,4,"I use a lot of raw cocoa for my power protein drinks.  With the high price of cocoa on the commodity market, this is an excellent price, especially for an organic product.  The cocoa is less ""tasty"" than my regular brand, but does very well for the price.  My main complaint is that the product came in a sealed plastic bag with NO label.  I would like to see an organic label, as well as, the nutrition info for the product."
1320,1320,1320,1321,1,"As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!"
1321,1321,1321,1322,5,"This cocoa powder has a deep, fruity taste- I highly recommend it.  I recently bought a vitamix blender, which means that I now make 5 smoothies a day.  This cocoa powder, plus some almond milk, frozen fruit, yogurt, and a dash of maple syrup, makes an excellent ""milk shake"".  Disclaimer: I like 99.9% of all chocolate, so take this positive review with a grain of salt."
1322,1322,1322,1323,5,"Almost identical to Ghiradeli's great chocolate taste...but raw!organic! The best!!! I also whip it into whipped up sprouted almonds with Strvia and make ball/snacks from it, yummmm"
1323,1323,1323,1324,5,This was my first time ordering raw cacao powder and I was pleasantly surprised!  The item was packed and shipped professionally and I love the resealable bag.  I initially tasted the cacao by dipping my finger in the bag and I didn't taste anything.  I then placed two tablespoons in my homemade vegetable/fruit juice which normally tastes like bananas...  I was pleasantly surprised because it now tasted like a bona fide chocolate shake!  This is one of the best deals you'll find (online) on certified organic raw cacao and it tastes great.  This is one of the healthiest foods in the world and I recommend this seller if you're looking to purchase it.
1324,1324,1324,1325,5,"Raw Cacao Powder differs greatly in taste than processed Cacao Powder. Commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted. Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor. Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isn't. It is a antioxidant super-food which has no equal. The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. As to taste, it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of Mahogany. In foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao. In baking, I believe it goes well with other flavors such as Almond Extract. If you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of Almond extract, your icing will have no equal. In chocolate cake I personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake. The acid helps to unify and amplify flavors. I like making cake with 60% cake flour which is about has about 5% wheat gluten and 40% rice flour. The reason for this should be obvious. The heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough.<br /><br />Raw Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols, such as catechins and procyanidins, and has been shown to inhibit low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models. Human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and decreases LDL levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens."
1325,1325,1325,1326,1,"This product, described as organic raw cacao powder from Peru, is clearly inferior to all other raw cacao powder I have had.  The taste of this product is definitely not as good -- this product has a bitter, muddy, thin taste as compared to the fuller, richer taste of the real thing from other vendors.  As soon as I tasted this product, which is destined for the trash bag, I understood why it was cheaper than organic cacao from other vendors -- it is nowhere near as good.  Spend a few dollars more and get the real thing."
1326,1326,1326,1327,5,"This powder, and this company, are both superb. There was a small problem with the order and they handled it in such a gracious manner that I will be a customer forever."
1327,1327,1327,1328,5,"This is a very tasty cacao powder.  It arrived in an unmarked bag (does not have an organic symbol or product description) but it seems to be the real deal.  Good flavor, similar to or better than name brand powders I have purchased in the past.  Will definitely purchase again."
1328,1328,1328,1329,5,bought as gift for hard to buy for father...he LOVED  bread said it was delicious !!
1329,1329,1329,1330,5,WONDERFUL PRODUCT.<br /><br />ALL THE BREAD MIXES I HAVE TRIED ON AMAZON ARE NOT DISAPPOINTING!!!<br /><br />WILL BE BACK FOR MORE.  THEY WILL MAKE GREAT CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.
1330,1330,1330,1331,5,"I figured there must be bacon out there like bacon used to be - this is it.  If you are of a 'certain age' (over 40 or 50?) you remember the deep smoky flavor of a good bacon; this cannot be found in ""store bacon"" anymore.  Modern bacon is thin, lightly/poorly smoked - even the so-called 'gourmet' bacon.  This is the old fashioned flavor and thickness of bacon the way it was in the ""good old days.""  Arrives nice and cool in an ice pack - cheaper if you buy the 12-pack."
1331,1331,1331,1332,5,"Love this, dont use too much because it is strong, but it tastes great.  Makes even mediocre salmon taste great."
1332,1332,1332,1333,5,"These are thin,crisp, fragrant cookies and are very delicious and tasty. They are excellent with a glass of cold almond milk or hot herbal tea. (my choices) If you like ginger snaps you will love Lars ginger snaps."
1333,1333,1333,1334,5,These ginger cookies are it...I don't have to look anymore ...I have found THE cookie ...I ate the entire box and did not share...so hubby said when I order more I have to get 2 boxes cause he would like to have some..:)
1334,1334,1334,1335,5,"Very good.  Very tasty and authentic flavor!  I ordered these last minute for Christmas, not knowing if they were going to arrive on time.  They arrived at my house on Christmas Eve."
1335,1335,1335,1336,5,"Didn't have time to make these this year so I thought I would buy them. I never buy cookies, but these I would buy again. My son loved them. The only thing I had to do was dip them in white chocolate.<br />Thanks"
1336,1336,1336,1337,2,"Ya know, when you're on a gluten-free diet, you YEARN for those forbidden treats - like licorice! (and malted milk!) Realizing that true licorice on this challenging diet is in the past and not likely to ever be repeated in the near future, we need to alter our expectations for this treat.<br /><br />I had tried this company's raspberry laces and strawberry laces - pretty good, although not easy to chew (think bubblegum).  Not REAL licorice you understand, but pretty doggone good as an alternative.<br /><br />So I thought I try these too - how bad could they be?  I found them pleasant to chew - not tough at all.  But the taste?  Nasty and medicinal cough syrup with an aftertaste that is truly awful.<br /><br />So I'm stuck with 11 packs.<br /><br />See if you can't find a source where you can buy just ONE pack to try out.  Your tastes may be different than mine, and you might enjoy them."
1337,1337,1337,1338,5,"After finding out two of our family members have celiac disease, we had to give up licorice and cherry nibs.  Candy Tree's Organic Cherry Bites have no sugar and truly rival the cherry nibs with gluten.  After a year of not having the ""real thing"" my husband believes Candy Tree's are actually better."
1338,1338,1338,1339,5,This licorice has very good taste.  My daughter is on a gluten free diet and she loves these cherry bites.
1339,1339,1339,1340,3,Maybe these a better when they're very fresh.  You could ruin dental work if not careful chewing these.  They taste great.
1340,1340,1340,1341,4,"Wow--this was the first licorice I'd had in two years after being diagnosed with Celiac disease.  That was one of the hardest things to give up!  These are nice--not exactly like the real thing, but close enough.  There are many companies that call their product ""licorice,"" but they are merely rip-offs of ""Dots"" candy: i.e. nothing like real licorice--very gooey and stick to your teeth.  These are quite firm, more like older licorice, but still a great chew.  It satisfied me and my craving for ""real"" licorice."
1341,1341,1341,1342,4,"Gluten Free foods tend to be extremely expensive when compared to ""regular"" foods. This licorice follows that trend. For the times when you'd like to treat yourself, Candy Tree Organic Licorice is a tasty and safe treat for Gluten Intolerant people. Amazon seems to have the best prices on it too."
1342,1342,1342,1343,5,"This dressing became an instant favorite of mine.  It's fat free without losing the flavor.  Alot of other dresings lose alot of flavor in their fat free versions, and that only makes you have to use twice as much.  Wish Bone is now my only choice for Ranch dressing.  My husband doesn't usually go for fat free or diet anything, but I put this on our salads and he didnt even know!"
1343,1343,1343,1344,5,"If I had not purchased this salad dressing myself, I never would have guessed it was fat free. Served it with fresh vegetables during Thanksgiving pre-dinner, and it was a definite hit with the guests too."
1344,1344,1344,1345,5,"Like the flavor and it's thick, unlike some fat free dressings that are really runny."

1346,1346,1346,1347,5,The price is pretty good given that local stores sell one bottle for almost $4. Don't know why the price on this has gone up though.
1347,1347,1347,1348,5,My doc has strictly limited me on what I can and cannot eat. I can use this salad dressing and was pleased to find it in bulk at a great price. Good taste.
1348,1348,1348,1349,1,"I bought this for my husband since he loves Ranch. He uses ranch dressing with everything. Before I bought it, I read a review that said it taste good inspite of the fat-free... Well, my husband had it and says it's aweful. I guess ""to each his own"" everyone's tastebuds are not alike.  Someone else may like it, so I am not going to discourage anyone from trying it. However, I had to cancel my subscription because the only one that likes Ranch in the family, doesn't like this one. I guess he needs the fat:)"
1349,1349,1349,1350,5,WANT TO TASTE SOMETHING DIFFERENT?  THEN YOU ARE COMING TO THE RIGHT PLACE.  I JUST LOVE THE SMOOTHNESS  AND FLAVOR OF THE RANCH DRESSINGNOW GET ON YOUR HORSES (OR MULES) AND ORDER SOME TODAY.
1350,1350,1350,1351,5,"This is a very smooth tea from Argo Tea.  I was so excited when they came to NYC, and I bought a bag of this tea to make at home.  It has an almondy/chocolatey flavor (but not overpowering).  It's a great tea for everyone, including people just starting to drink tea.  I love it in a Latte (I just microwave some milk and use that instead of water)."
1351,1351,1351,1352,5,"If you like jasmine tea, This is a great tea! Its lite not, overly medicine tasting like jasmine tea can be. Its also fun to watch the tea leaves unfurl... I steep it so many times that until I lost count.. haha. Just Great ."
1352,1352,1352,1353,5,We received a box of these at work and the whole package was gone moments after opening it up!  Great biscuits and now I am ordering a couple boxes for a few gifts for people I can't figure out what to get...
1353,1353,1353,1354,3,"I sent this product to my brother in law, so I have never seen the product and know nothing about it.  All I heard from him was that he was not impressed.  Other than that, I can say that it was delivered.  I ordered two of these going to different addresses and we got immediate feedback on the first one, but until we spoke to my brother in law, we had no idea if the product had even been shipped.  Would I order again?  Probably not...<br /><br />Thanks anyway,<br />Curt U"
1354,1354,1354,1355,5,"Of all the flavors of tic tacs, these are my favorite.  Great wild cherry flavor. Love them!! Too bad they aren't more readily available to purchase locally."
1355,1355,1355,1356,5,"These little buggers are tough to find so I was happy to get a big pack at a good price online.  My daughter is content with these as a reward for doing something well and at 2 calories a piece, not all that unhealthy."
1356,1356,1356,1357,5,Definitely would reorder these again.  I think it would be better if they were offered in a bigger pack.  My kids love these.  Great little Valentine's Day gifts.  Great stocking stuffers.
1357,1357,1357,1358,5,"I bought them for a friend because she loves the cherry ones and they're hard to find. I kept half for myself. I admit, gone in no time."
1358,1358,1358,1359,5,"Everyone knows what a Tic Tac is, but let me tell you something; if you like orange tic tac's, you're going to LOVE wild cherry tic tacs!  Very cherry flavored with just enough of a mix of sweet and sour.  Do yourself a favor and try some."
1359,1359,1359,1360,5,I love these Wild Cherry Tic Tacs and they are impossible to find in stores.  I am so glad that I can get them from Amazon and the price is excellent!  They are a great low calorie treat and I will keep buying them from Amazon.  Highly recommend this purchase!
1360,1360,1360,1361,4,I low orange tictacs and after reading reviews I decided to try these and there almost just as good. Orange is still my favorite but cherry is pretty close
1361,1361,1361,1362,5,"These are one of my favorite flavors of tic tacs.  The flavor is a true sour cherry and quite intense.  You really get a lot of flavor out of one 2-calorie treat, which can satisfy for quite a while!"
1362,1362,1362,1363,5,great thanks for the great service i don't know what else to say i have said all i have tu say.
1363,1363,1363,1364,4,"Since husband quit smoking many many yrs ago, he took up the tic-tac habit with cinnamon tic-tacs.  they no longer make cinnamon so he has tried the wild cherry and they are OK."
1364,1364,1364,1365,5,Very nice product<br />full of quality items - not the cheap candies like other baskets
1365,1365,1365,1366,5,Were just what my wife wanted and she loves them. Next she will get the other type of bar by the same vendor.
1366,1366,1366,1367,5,"I love sorghum flour.  It's mild in flavor and smell, it's easily mixed into flour blends for gluten free baking too.  It's one of my favorites along with millet, sweet rice, coconut and almond."
1367,1367,1367,1368,5,"I buy most of my flours from Bob's Red Mill in the 4-pack boxes, if only because having all the bags and boxes the same size makes it easier to store them.  It's good flour, and the bag's a good size for baking for a small family - also a good shape that will stand up on the counter while you scoop flour out of it."
1368,1368,1368,1369,5,My sister is alergic to wheat so I make her a lot of Gluten Free foods.  I searched local stores and could not find Sorghum Flour.  So I looked on Amazon and finally found it.  It was all packed wonderfully and arrived perfectly fine and I'm already using it.
1369,1369,1369,1370,5,"I love baking with The Bob's Red Mill 'Sweet' White Sorghum Flour. I use it in many things but I tend to lean toward sweeter treats such as Cakes and Muffins. I make a crumble topping with this flour that my family and guests beg for! I would highly recommend this flour to any baker, even more for the gluten-intolerant ones. I use normal recipes and just replace the wheat flour. It always turns out fantastic!"
1370,1370,1370,1371,5,I am a big fan of Sorghum flour for my baked goods. It gives everything a bit of sponge (especially cakes) and adds an extra bit of sweet to the baking. I highly recommend this for baking flour mixes - you may not want to add it to savory recipes though because of the light sweet flavor.
1371,1371,1371,1372,4,"Spectrum Naturals Walnut Oil, refined, is a very mild oil. I can't detect any walnut smell or taste any walnut flavor at all. Maybe that's what you want in some cases, though I was hoping for a more nutty flavor like raw walnuts.<br /><br />It does have the advantage of having higher Omega 3 content than most oils. Also most oils that are high in Omega 3 (like fish oil and flax oil) have a strong taste which you probably don't want on your salad.<br /><br />Unlike some of Spectrum's oils, it is not organic."
1372,1372,1372,1373,5,Great product!<br /><br />The Stevia powder will not raise your blood glucose level and it is all natural.<br /><br />Use very sparingly since it is much sweeter than sugar.<br /><br />Tastes more natural than artifical sweeteners and is healthy to use since it is an organic natural sweetener.
1373,1373,1373,1374,5,"I have recently been on a low carb diet, as I find that I can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave, honey, and dates. These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is ""store fat!"" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.<br /><br />My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the ""during taste"" either.<br /><br />Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)<br /><br />Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!"
1374,1374,1374,1375,3,"I have mixed feelings about NuNaturals Nustevia White Stevia with Maltodextrin Powder and will probably not purchase it again.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great tasting stevia extract and very easy to use, but it is just 6.4 percent stevia and 93.6 percent maltodextrin filler.  In other words only 6 pennies of each dollar you spend on this stuff is buying you high quality stevia extract powder.  In my opinion, this is unnecessarily dilute; however, it does make it exceptionally easy to measure.  If the labeling said 6.4% stevia extract, I would have passed on this from the beginning as I can get 70% dry stevia extract of the same quality for much less money per serving of stevia. If this is your first time buying stevia, go for it as it's easy to use and tastes great.  If you're accustomed to buying and using concentrated stevia extracts, you will be probably be disappointed by the low concentration of this product's mixture.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- 5-star taste<br />- Easy to measure<br />- Perfect for first-time stevia users<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Cons<br />- Only 6.4% stevia<br />- Not cost-competitive with 70% or pure dry stevia extracts<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Overall, a good product but not the best value.  I would given it 4 stars if the product labeling didn't try to hide the fact that it's just not very potent.  For about 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of this product, you can buy concentrated stevia powders and cut them yourself with a low-cost filler like maltodextrin and come out ahead (or just use them full strength, which is often easier once you get used to the sweetening power of pure stevia).<br /><br />In case you're wondering where I got the 6.4% (by mass) value from, this is how I calculated it.  On a precise scale, I found the density of this product to be 2.5 grams per teaspoon.  The label says it contains 40mg per 1/4 tsp.  Thus, 1 tsp has 160mg stevia extract in 2500mg mixed powder.  The concentration (mass) comes to 64mg stevia per gram of product or 6.4 percent by weight.  Pretty weak stuff, but still much sweeter than cane sugar."
1375,1375,1375,1376,5,"I used to use agave nectar and honey. Even though I picked organic, there was still more sugar than desired after I put in my recipes. I actually got Tinea Versicolor due to the sugars in those products.<br /><br />But this product is great. I use it in my protein shakes, smoothies, and baking recipes (muffins, breads), and it's awesome.<br /><br />I make a chocolate milkshake and this stuff really rounds off the edges:<br />- Cottage Cheese<br />- Chocolate Protein Powder<br />- Cacao powder<br />- Almond Milk<br />- Nustevia powder<br /><br />Just need maybe 1/4 cup of each ingredient and 1 cup of almond milk and it takes just like a sugary chocolate milk shake."
1376,1376,1376,1377,5,This is the best tasting stevia powder I've tried. Most other powders have a weird after taste but this one doesn't. I recently bought a 5lb bag of it online and I'm making my way through it.
1377,1377,1377,1378,5,"Cutting sugar out of our diet,we went to splenda. Then finding that it was also unhealthy and baking with it made foods flat and dry. We went to stevia no calorie powder, after much research proved that stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no bad health effects. The trick to using stevia is to use tiny amounts and then taste it and add a bit more at a time to suit your taste. I also found that using a stevia that has an 80% ratio is the best tasting and this is the best that I have found. Because of using VERY SMALL amounts this jar lasts for months. This is also the best price ANYWHERE! Swanson is a trusted vendor as is Amazon."
1378,1378,1378,1379,5,"I am hooked on Stevia. Not only is it all natural but it tastes great and is truly a guilt free sweetner.<br /><br />Of all the brands I have tried NuNaturals is the best; it dissolves easily in ice tea and it does not have any bitter taste.<br /><br />I keep the packets in my car and my backpack for when I eat out, I use the stevia baking blend to replace sugar in all my muffins and cookies, and this is large 12 oz jar the best size for use at home. I keep a 1/4 tsp measuring spoon in the jar to spoon it out.<br /><br />I have given up all artificial sweetners. I no longer drink diet coke (and wont until they make it with stevia instead of splenda).<br /><br />If you have not used stevia before I urge you to try it. If you have used other brands and did not like them try NuStevia and you will be impressed."
1379,1379,1379,1380,5,This has been the best tasting Stevia I have tried.  I also think this is a better value than some of the others.  I really like not having to open all the packets when I make a gallon of Tea.
1380,1380,1380,1381,5,"If you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea, Stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea. You can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the Stevia powder.<br /><br />Unlike artificial sweeteners, Stevia is never bitter and won't leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth. The packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods.<br /><br />By using a low calorie (0 Calories) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs, you will be ahead of the game. Every single time you use one packet of Stevia, you are using less sugar and you won't even miss it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
1381,1381,1381,1382,1,"This was my favorite stevia product and I had it on subscribe and save until I queried customer service about NuNaturals GMO use.  Yes, NuNaturals uses GMO products.  SO, I've canceled my subscribe and save order and am now using <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL3U0"">Stevita Stevia Clear Liquid Extract, 3.3-Ounce Container (Pack of 3)</a>."
1382,1382,1382,1383,3,Maybe my tastebuds are different but I bought this at a local healthfood store and I'm not completely sold on it.  I tried it in my tea and it did leave me w/ an aftertaste...just like most sweetners. *shrugs*
1383,1383,1383,1384,5,"I hated Stevia and it's licorice taste until I tried Nustevia.  Since that day, I have almost completely eliminated sugar in my drinks.  I like that it is a plant based product and not bio-engineered.  No after-taste and you need very little to make anything taste sweet."
1384,1384,1384,1385,5,"I don't like using artificial sweeteners because of the chemicals and because they don't taste good. I am a caregiver for my diabetic dad, and once I discovered this product I was hooked, except that it is hard to find where I live. When I found it at Amazon I put it on auto ship so I don't run out.  The price has gone up a lot since I first found it on Amazon, however, it still costs more in stores if and when I can find it there. I make limeade with this which I keep on hand at all times. In a gallon container of water I add 1 cup of lime juice and 2tbsp. of stevia powder. It is refreshing and almost no calories and no chemical aftertaste.  My dad uses the stevia in his coffee and his oatmeal. I haven't tried cooking with it although I know they make one designed for baking, which I'll possibly try this winter."
1385,1385,1385,1386,4,"I bought the NuNaturals White Stevia with Maltodextrin several months ago as I'm trying to cut back on sugar and artificial sweeteners. The first morning I tried it in my coffee and hated it. It tastes just as bitter as Equal or Sweet n Low. I decided to give it another  try that same day in my lemonade and it was absolutely delicious. I've also tried it in hot tea and it is bitter but wonderful in iced tea. So, I think hot drinks bring out the bitterness in stevia. All in all I'm glad I bought this and also a box of the packets which are very convenient on the go. I have tried many different brands of stevia but, so far this is the only one I have not thrown out. I also tried Truvia. Not a fan. It makes your coffee or tea taste like licorice!"
1386,1386,1386,1387,5,"If you are trying to get off sugar, this is the product for you. I has a great sweet taste without spiking your insulin, and no bitter aftertaste.  Great for diabetics and anyone trying to eat healthy.  I love this product."
1387,1387,1387,1388,5,"I have tried various brands of stevia, but I always come back to NuNaturals.  I buy the 12 ounce container because I use it to sweeten everything.  If you have a sweet tooth as I do but don't need the added pounds, then this is the ticket for you.  I drink a lot of tea, and this is my sweetener.  A lot of other stevia brands leave a bitter after taste, but this is the best that I have found to resolve that problem.  Highly recommended."
1388,1388,1388,1389,5,If you need to cut down on sugar this is the way to go! I love Stevia in my iced tea and it's great on your cereal also. Great stuff!!
1389,1389,1389,1390,5,"I started using NuStevia several years ago.  Back then I had to purchase it from a health food store.  Thanks to Amazon I can now order and have it within a few days.  I never run out!  As for the product, it's the best.  I've tried several Stevia products but they have an after taste.  Not with NuStevia.  Please try if you haven't."
1390,1390,1390,1391,5,"I was looking for a healthier alternative to Splenda and Equal, NuStevia taste great and this container lasts a long time."
1391,1391,1391,1392,5,"Stevia is pretty much the only natural zero-calorie sweetener there is, but most of the time the powdered stevia is so bitter!  Not Nustevia!  Nustevia has absolutely NO bitterness, and tastes EXACTLY like real sugar!  It's amazing!  Add it to plain yogurt, you have an amazing guilt-free dessert, breakfast, side dish, snack.  Add it to tea, coffee, recipes, anything!  It is a truly magical product, and it is cheaper in the 12 oz container on Amazon than anywhere else!  They also sell it at GNC, but it is $10 for 4 oz.  Also, for drinks, I highly recommend the extremely potent liquid stevia, as sometimes the powdered version takes a while to dissolve in iced beverages (it eventually does dissolve, though)."
1392,1392,1392,1393,4,"After years of using synthetic sweeteners like Equal and Sweet N Low, I realized their long-term effects and wanted to find a good alternative. NuStevia was a lucky discovery. It has virtually no bitter aftertase, it's all natural and I've been using it exclusively for more than a year now. It works in both hot and cold beverages and comes in bulk and in packets for portability.I haven't used it for baking and probably won't because the chemistry of most recipes depends on sugar or something similar to get a good effect. However, for daily use in beverages, this product is very good."
1393,1393,1393,1394,5,"I was quite skeptical about stevia at first, but tried it with another brand and thought there wasn't much difference in taste and I felt better about using a more natural product than the other artificial sweeteners out there. I then started looking at getting a bulk container and happened upon this product. I now have purchased this same product 4 times and am quite pleased. The product is a bit more concentrated and we are using less of the product in our drinks and cooking than other competitors.<br /><br />The deliveries are always quick and we have not had any issues at all with the product or packaging."
1394,1394,1394,1395,5,"We love this and use it as a sugar substitute in just about everything (beverages, desserts, cooking). It is not at all bitter, even in hot drinks like coffee. For baking, there are good substitution charts online that tell you how much stevia to use per cup of sugar ([...]). If you need to replace the ""bulk"" of sugar in a recipe, you also have to add homemade apple fiber to make it work ([...]). My kids don't notice the switch and I feel good about using it because it's all natural."
1395,1395,1395,1396,5,"I am so happy I discovered this product. I had tried several other brands in extract and powder form and NuNaturals is by far the best. Virtually NO aftertaste, quick dissolving and convenient. It is also very economical at 1.5 cents a serving. I use a 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon and it sweetens my coffee or tea perfectly. Do yourself a flavor and get this stevia powder - you'll be happy you did!"
1396,1396,1396,1397,5,"I discovered this product a couple of years ago and really liked the taste in coffee , tea and on fruit and oatmeal.  It was a lot less expensive in the packets then, but I've switched to the large 12 oz. container and the price is very good. I don't use sugar and this helps me have the ""sweet"" and not the increased blood sugar-YEAH!!"
1397,1397,1397,1398,5,I love this stevia! I have tried MANY different kinds over the years and this one is my FAVE! Goes great in my coffee and tea. I have this one on auto ship and get one a month (makes it pretty cheap too!)
1398,1398,1398,1399,5,"I have tried every brand of stevia on the market and this is, hands down, the very best out there.  I use Nu-Naturals NuStevia for all sweetening purposes.  It can be hard to find even in health food stores and the ones that carry it usually charge a premium.  I was delighted to find it on amazon.com for a very reasonable price, even less when obtained through a standing order."
1399,1399,1399,1400,5,"this stevia is the best tasting we've ever tried. it also mixes into beverages more thoroughly than some others.the service from this buyer was prompt, the product arrived on time and in excellent condition. would order from them again, and recommend them to others.Linda blyth"
1400,1400,1400,1401,5,"I ordered this after having much success with their liquid products. It is not bitter at all and has a very fresh/clean taste to it.  I have baked with it, used it on the stove, and in my oatmeal and hot cocoa.  When I run out, I'll be ordering more!"
1401,1401,1401,1402,5,"NuNaturals Stevia is the only sweetener that I use in my beverages and cooking. I have tried other brands and this one is the best! It hasn't any odd taste, and tastes better than sugar to me. I buy the large 12 ounce container and it lasts me for months! I only wish they would put this in more products sold at the grocery stores. There is a soda that has stevia in it that I purchase at a health food store called Virgil's Zero and it comes in different flavors...it is great and I don't have to be concerned about the sugar content that is in traditional sodas. This product is great and I think is the best of stevia products on the market."
1402,1402,1402,1403,5,"I find that this jar product works better for people without as much dexterity in their hands; vs using/opening sweetener packets.  This product works well both in cold & hot things like homemade lemonade & in coffee.  Easy to open lid. Product dissolves more easily in cold liquids, than many other types of stevia."
1403,1403,1403,1404,5,"I used to buy this product in this size at a health food store in Florida for 27 dollars. Where I moved to in NY I could not find it in the stores so I looked online. With shipping costs, it still cost under 20 dollars.<br /><br />I use this product in tea and coffee and I like it better than real sugar. I don't find it bitter at all even when I accidently put a little too much in ice tea. Sometimes I forget it's not real sugar when it's in ice tea. I especially like that it has no other additives for texture or taste. I have used it in baking simple pound cakes and cookies and they were good."
1404,1404,1404,1405,4,"NuStevia's White Stevia powder is amazing!  I have been on a low-carb diet for the last year and have lost 27 lbs, and NuStevia products were a big help with the success of my diet.  I love sweet things, and without them I don't think I'd have been able to stay on the low-carb diet.  I have been unable to eat sugar for a long, long while.  I had previously switched to natural sweeteners like honey and agave, but when I discovered they were not on the low-carb diet I'd switched to, I had to find something else to use as a substitute.  NuStevia products are what I chose.  I tried several other types of stevia, but NuStevia products seem to be the best so far.  The bitter aftertaste associated with most stevia products is almost completely absent from NuStevia products.<br />NuStevia white stevia powder is super sweet, so you'll have to use it sparingly, and one bottle lasts a very long time.<br />I'm very happy with the product and will be buying it again and again."
1405,1405,1405,1406,5,"The first time I tried this product  was 2 years ago at the Venetian spa restaurant in Las Vegas  having  a cup of tea with some friends. We all remarked how delicious and tasty it made our tea.  We've been using it ever since. A little goes a long way and I use it anytime I would ordinarily use a sweetener.  Since the artificial sweeteners are so unsafe and unhealthy and I have a sweet tooth, I felt this was a safe alternative. Not only is it safer, but there's no aftertaste and doesn't raise your blood sugar level. This particular stevia has absolutely no bitter taste to it. I've tried others before and since and there's no comparison."
1406,1406,1406,1407,5,"Very happy with the product.... in a taste test, for the price, it ranks very high.  Delivery was prompt and as expected."
1407,1407,1407,1408,5,"Love this on a toasted bagel with cream cheese and scallions or even dill, great way to enjoy caviar and not break the bank."
1408,1408,1408,1409,5,"Roland Red lumpfish Caviar is excellent.The price is good and affordable,it makes a good presentation for company, and tastes very good. I purchased many items from Amazon, even large ticket items, and I am very satisfied with the products and service."
1409,1409,1409,1410,1,"I bought this 4 pack to have some inexpensive caviar to use for garnish over the holidays. The other night I decided to go ahead and use one for some dip. It was so bad I couldn't believe it. It wasn't spoiled, it just had an odd flavor with a terrible aftertaste. It didn't even taste like caviar. I threw the jar away."
1410,1410,1410,1411,3,"This stuff isn't bad at all. But you know how you can just eat spoon after spoon of really good caviar without toast points or crackers or anything? This roe is more for sprinkling over fish dishes, morning eggs or a caesar salad. All in all, for the price, it's pretty good,"
1411,1411,1411,1412,3,"I use red lumpfish caviar in a couple of dishes, and this brand is as good as any I've found, though the red coloring is perhaps a little much!"
1412,1412,1412,1413,1,I ordered this for gifts around Christmas time. I actually was hoping to use it for our Christmas day meal. Two out of the four jars I ordered were rotten and inedible. I never did get to try it and I was very annoyed and disappointed!
1413,1413,1413,1414,2,"This stuff sounded perfect...way too much red dye and no taste according to me and my 3 friends who tried it...kind of salty.  Basically, I would stay away from it.  I am tempted to toss it out, but paid too much to feel right about it..."
1414,1414,1414,1415,5,"Because they brought bagels to America without which we never could get maximum level of enjoyment out of this delightful low cost caviar.  Caviar for breakfast!  We use the small soft plain bagels cut in two upon which we smooth a bit of cream cheese then a nice ring of caviar in the center of which is colorful and delicious cut up hard cooked egg then add a perfect cup of coffee.  This is is best done on a week end so it can be savored ever so slowly--no stress involved--pure luxury.  Yes, Yes, Yes, yes, yes."
1415,1415,1415,1416,5,"Not knowing what to expect I decided to take a chance since it wasn't that expensive.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the caviar.  I put this stuff on just about anything I could and it was amazing.  I don't know too much about caviar, but for this price I don't think anybody can complain."
1416,1416,1416,1417,5,This is a joy to serve on my mini potato pancakes  with sour cream and then a teaspoon of this caviar on top. Soooooo tasty and pretty for Christmas. Thanks for offering it.
1417,1417,1417,1418,2,Caviar taste awful. Maybe it's because I bought from a cheaper brand or maybe because cavier is just bad no matter who you buy it from or how much you paid for it? Why do people like to waste money on these things?
1418,1418,1418,1419,5,"All of the Roland products are top quality.  Roland's caviar is the real deal, unlike some other brands that are really made from seaweed!"
1419,1419,1419,1420,5,if u have not tried this u r missing the best thing u could cook for your family.I give this 10 stars.
1420,1420,1420,1421,5,"Cooked in healthy coconut oil that's why it stays crunchy! Will not give you side effects of vegetable oil - oxidized cholesterol, transfats, rancidity, and free radicals when you eat foods fried in canola soybean or corn oil."
1421,1421,1421,1422,3,"Thought these were the larger sized ones you see in stores but I was mistaken.  These pops are about 7"" inches long and a little less than 1"" inch wide.  Flavors are comparable to Flavor-Ice, not necessarily better.  My wife and I enjoy these throughout the year instead of ice cream, but we can only find them in our local grocery store during the summer months.  Glad we can get them via Amazon! These were on sale for $5.48 per box of 100 with free shipping, so I think we got a good value.  Without the sale pricing, I'm not sure if we'd choose these over another brand, but if they do go on sale again, we would probably buy them again.  Not bad, just a little small...  Eat two!  ;-)"
1422,1422,1422,1423,4,These are a cheap alternative for summer when everyone wants a cold treat. Superior flavor and size than the Fla-Vor-Ice case.
1423,1423,1423,1424,4,"We first tasted this coffee in the hotel coffee shop in Costa Rica while on vacation.  We bought a few bags and brought them back home with us.  Costa Rica grows arabica coffee beans, fantastic.  We enjoy good coffee and it is best in the morning. It's strong, flavorful, full bodied, and not bitter.  In our 12 cup drip coffee maker, we use two rounded scoops (about 5 tbs).  When we finished the last of the coffee, we looked on Amazon and found the exact brand we had purchased in Costa Rica.  We bought four bags and will be getting more."
1424,1424,1424,1425,5,"Forget Starbucks, Peets or anything else. This is the real deal. Like a good vintage wine, Britt coffee is truly gourmet with no after taste! I am really fussy about coffee, and generally avoid it, but after a trip to Costa Rica fell in love with the beverage again! You have to use a French Press to get the full favor so throw away those other coffee making contraptions, your beans deserve the best, your taste buds deserve the best too. No I don't work for Britt and did not get paid to say this!!!!!  But if you guys at Britt read this send me a sample or two!!"
1425,1425,1425,1426,5,"This  coffee is the smoothest dark roast coffee I have ever tasted,and it was a pleasure to sip this full bodied coffee before breakfast and after dinner."
1426,1426,1426,1427,5,"I love this coffee! Like the other reviewers, I took a trip to Costa Rica and was immediately addicted to this bold, flavorful coffee. I am a cover lover and have tried many different brands only to find that Britt is hands-down the best I've ever had. I brought back one bag from Costa Rica and have started ordering my supply because I can't go back to other bland store-bought coffees. Definitely worth a try! You won't be disappointed."
1427,1427,1427,1428,5,This coffee is delicious. It is full bodied and leaves a great almost chocolaty after taste. My dad told me about it after a trip to Costa Rica.
1428,1428,1428,1429,5,"My husband and I took a vacation to Costa Rica and had a wonderful time.  The whole time we were there we drank there Britt Dark Roast and loved the taste.  There was no bitter after taste, plus I normally drink decaf and noticed with the Britt regular dark roast it didn't bother me at all!!! I don't have to order decaf anymore and can enjoy the regular. I now order it on line and find it to be the best tasting coffee I've ever had.<br />Thanks for growing the best coffee beans in the world!!!"
1429,1429,1429,1430,5,Great tasting coffiee!! One of the best I've ever had! The problem here is the high shipping costs.
1430,1430,1430,1431,5,My husband and I fell in love with Cafe Britt coffee while we were in Costa Rica.  Upon our return we were delighted to see that we could order it through amazon.com!  The coffee is easy to drink - not bitter or harsh and is a great way to start your day.  Highly recommended.
1431,1431,1431,1432,4,"I used to use this coffee after we visited Costa Rica and gave some to my aunt.  She thinks it is the best coffee there is, so I gave her some for Christmas.  It is excellent."
1432,1432,1432,1433,5,"I first tried Britt dark roast when I was In Costa Rica.  It has a lot of rich flavor, but it is not bitter at all.  I've bought<br />it by the case ever since.  It's really no more expensive than those ""gourmet"" brands you find at your local store.  This is<br />simply the best coffee I've ever had, and I've tried many supposedly special ones over the years."
1433,1433,1433,1434,1,"I would never have ordered this had I known I was only going to be sent 12, and one of them was open and leaking powdered spice out. I complained to Amazon, and I know from experience that they always have awesome customer service. Since I just got my package today and just opened it now, I have to wait a bit to hear back from them on this issue...will keep you updated. I just wanted you guys to know that even though it states 144 packets, it is NOT. Must be a misprint? Double check with Amazon before you order this. What sounds like an awesome deal is a meh deal if you are getting only 12 of them."

1439,1439,1439,1440,3,"Are you familiar with the Hormel Compleats line?  If so, put this one in the middle of the pack.  It's not as good as the meatloaf or the meatballs/noodles in cream sauce.  It's better than the horribly taste-free chicken/dressing.  About even with the turkey.  Is that all I've tried?  I forget; but you get the point.  It's medium-Compleat.<br /><br />Are you just thinking about trying a Hormel Compleat for the first time?  OK, then just remember these reviews on Amazon -- particularly food reviews -- are all simply opinions of customers, no scientific analysis intended (I hope).<br /><br />Compleats are quick, easy (except for pulling the plastic off the top) and generally edible.  There's not a whole lot more to say about them.  I eat them because I'm an old guy living alone and too often I'm just lazy.  These do come in handy for a quick light meal.  ""Light"" depending on your appetite and the size of your tummy.<br /><br />This is a good one to lead off with if you're just now getting into Compleats.  Just note that, in my opinion, it's middle of the road for the line.  Not a lot of flavor; but goes down OK."
1440,1440,1440,1441,3,"I've tried several of the Compleats line, including this one, and they all have one thing in common: the picture on the box looks like a lot of food with a moderate amount of sauce on it, but the box actually contains a moderate amount of food with a lot of sauce on it.<br /><br />The Chicken and Rice flavor has some shredded chicken with rice, carrots and peas and a whole lot of chickeny flavored sauce. It's very salty but not lacking in chicken flavor. The texture of all of the ingredients is decent, neither too firm nor too mushy, except for the ratio of sauce to solid food being too saucy. Overall, I'd say it's fine in a pinch - these shelf-stable meals are easier to find than most - but if you have other options available, these are only fair-to-middlin'."
1441,1441,1441,1442,4,"These radiation-treated dinners that don't need freezing are a great convenience.  I've tried quite a few of the Hormel Compleats and this is one of my favorites.  Home cookin', it ain't, and it's a bit too salty, but for a satisfying meal in 90 seconds, it's hard to beat.  The only reason I've given this flavorful, decently chicken-filled dish 4 stars instead of 5 is because the rice is white.  We all know by now that whole grains are healthier, so, until these companies start making their dishes with whole wheat pasta and brown rice, I'll mark them down."
1442,1442,1442,1443,5,I subscribe to several Hormel Compleats. This is definitely the best flavored dinner I have tried.  I am planning to double my subscription.
1443,1443,1443,1444,3,"Like the majority of other meals in the Hormel line, this one is excessively salty. That alone is tolerable though if only the meal wasn't swimming in sauce. This ends up being more like a soup than a rice meal which is an utter shame because everything else is fairly nice and the enormous amount of sauce ruins it.<br /><br />But it's very quick and easy to make and fills you up so even a blah meal like this fits the bill. It's not my favorite of this type of meals but I wouldn't turn it down for lunch one hungry afternoon."
1444,1444,1444,1445,1,"Me and my wife have tried a wide range of the Hormel compleats, and this is by far the worst tasting one of the bunch. I could complain about the lack of ""Chicken"" but the horrid taste even<br />overshadows that minor drawback. I know its a cheap meal,  but I do expect something at least a little edible.  If you are looking to the Compleats then go with something at least worth you money, pick up the far superior tasting Spaghetti or Turkey dinners, and feed this thing to the family dog."
1445,1445,1445,1446,4,Not so sure about this product. Chicken and Rice is not really what there is. Sure there is some chicken and some rice but mostly gravy. All in all I still like it.
1446,1446,1446,1447,3,"Not bad, but like others say a bit too salty. I do notice a strange after taste, tho. I like Boyardee's better. And won't buy this again."
1447,1447,1447,1448,2,"This is a starchy soup rather than the meal portrayed on the outside.  There is very little taste and very little chicken.  It is mostly rice in a weak chicken stock thickened with potato and corn starch.<br /><br />It is not repulsively bad, if you want a light, convenient snack.<br /><br />The Chef Boyardee microwavable meals are tastier and more substantial, and also more convenient because you just have to pull off the lid, which comes away easily.  With these Hormel Compleats, you have to pierce the top first, and then peel it off afterwards, which is not so easy, especially as it is hot."
1448,1448,1448,1449,5,"These dinners are as close to perfect as can be found here in the mountains.  Quick, easy and delicious!"
1449,1449,1449,1450,5,"I'm not so sure why the other guy didn't like this so much, I LOVE IT!!  In fact, it might just be one of my favorite foods around.  It's tried and true, rarely cooks wrong, and always good to warm the belly and soul.  I only but this flavor, it's so good, why deviate from it?  I have tried other brands before, bit Maruchan makes the best ramen noodles in all of time."
1450,1450,1450,1451,3,"This is ramen, a cheap, easy, and fast noodle meal that is pretty cheap. Its got its pros and cons, but mostly its pretty alright. The chicken flavor is good. Some people find it too salty, I like it as is. The price here on Amazon is comparable to some groceries when its not on sale, higher than others. Still, if you're like me and want to avoid the stores as much as possible, maybe paying a $1 more for 24 isn't such a big deal. Nutritionally its pretty meh. You could do a lot better. But its also a versatile base- you can always add lots of veggies, meat, other spices, pretty much anything to this to dress it up and make it a better meal option. We keep it in the house for quick lunches when no one wants to cook a meal just for themselves."
1451,1451,1451,1452,5,"Im on a quest to try all the Ramen Flavors. Ramen is a good lunch for me, being easy to make, cheap and versital. The Chicken flavor is one I remember but I havent had it in a long time, its one of the only flavors sold in stores where I live. I made some recently. Its better than I remember, salty but good. This is one of the more americanized flavors. I recommend NOT adding 2 cups of water. I added a bit more than 1 1/4 cup. and it was perfect. 1 1/4- 1 1/3 or 1 1/2 seems to be the perfect amount. I like eating it as a soup so I dont pour out the water. You can add things to Ramen like meat, eggs, or vegetarian protein and frozen veggies to make it a more filling meal or eat it plain. Or dont use the seasoning packet and add your own seasonings. Whatever you like. This is a great product, I recommend if you want easy, cheap lunches."
1452,1452,1452,1453,5,"This is a classic ramen choice.  Our kids, 3-6 love this.  When we're RVing, we have a case of this on hand.  A bowl, some water, and 2:30 in the microwave, and we've got our instant meal. We break up the noodles while still sealed in the package.  This helps the kids not make a mess when trying to eat them. They don't seem to tire of these; and we're not overly offended by the nature of the just-add-water-product. We each had our ramen-eating-college-days. These also make a great item to have on hand in a desk drawer for the days you forget your lunch, etc. at work.  Just make sure you have a pack of paper (not styro-save the enviro) bowls and some fork/spoons in that drawer, too."
1453,1453,1453,1454,5,"If you want a hot meal with no effort that is delious...this is the way. While cooking noodles...microwave left over meat/hot dog/boloni(sp?). Also, microwave a spoon or two of vegetable...left over/frozen/canned. After noodles cook/add season packet...pour over meat/veg...after a minute pour some of the liquid out...you have a wonderful meal with less sodium because you poured it out! College kids live off this meal because it is CHEAP/quick and can all be done in microwave if need be. You can get a case of Libby's carot/peas from AMAZON for about$11! Since you are using only a spoon or two...lasts a long time!"
1454,1454,1454,1455,4,A bit dry but still good. They may be perfectly all right; I just thought the noodles were hard and dry.<br />I'm still enjoying them.
1455,1455,1455,1456,2,"the taste isn't good, at least isn't good for Japanese and Chinese.<br />Its taste is basically sort of American Japanese taste.<br />Plus the price isn't competitive.<br /><br />I'd suggest Asians never buy it."
1456,1456,1456,1457,4,"I ordered this 13-pack sampler, and I have to say that I really do like the flavor of the Donut Shop Classics pods.  They are mellow, smooth, and have virtually no bitterness.  I just can't believe how fresh they manage to keep their pods.  I give them four stars because I prefer freshly roasted and ground, but to date, when I'm in a hurry in the mornings, which is most mornings, I reach for a pod of Donut Shop Classics."
1457,1457,1457,1458,5,"With this spice mix, you can recreate the taste of your favorite restaurant stews.  It is potent, so do not use too much. It smells heavenly. Perfect for both meat and bean stews."
1458,1458,1458,1459,4,If you like garlic this is for you. I've been making this as a dip with Greek yogurt and reduced fat mayonnaise. I usually add chopped spinach to it and serve it with crudites and chips. I have gotten rave reviews from my friends. My only complaint is that it consists of dried vegetables and a powder and it is difficult to make sure they are equally distributed when measuring it out.
1459,1459,1459,1460,5,"I've been eating the McDougall Right Foods for a few years now, and this is by far the best.  It takes exactly the way the name suggests.  It tastes great with cooked vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower, and it is very easy to make.  The only problem I have with it is that the noodles aren't thick enough for me, but I think one time I let them sit in the microwave a little longer and they became thick.  Other than that, I'd recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy and who enjoys noodles and peanut flavor."
1460,1460,1460,1461,5,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:38 Mins<br /><br /></span>skip the Pad Thai. go for this.<br />edit: this soup has moved up to the #6 spot when I typed in Dr. McDougall today. I'm glad, because I want to order this for a while, and don't want this soup to be seen as unprofitable by Right Foods (Dr. McDougall)."
1461,1461,1461,1462,5,I love the McDougall Asian Entr&eacute;es and although I haven't tried all of them this one is amazing. It has a really peanutty flavor that you wouldn't expect in a product containing only 3 grams of fat per serving. I would imagine these would make a great dinner added to a pound of mixed stir-fry vegetables...I am buying a case now to test just that! The peanut flavor is strong enough that I bet it'd distribute among a fair amount of vegetables or tofu when added so you wouldn't get very saucy noodles and dry veggies.<br /><br />I recommend this product. The best-tasting peanut noodle you'll be able to find for only 3 grams of fat.
1462,1462,1462,1463,5,This is a very tasty item. My wife doesn't eat meat and had to stay<br />in a hotel for 4 weeks during a training she attended. I had this shipped<br />to her and she raved about the great flavor and wanted more!
1463,1463,1463,1464,4,"Sure, I could have gone on a food crusade at the local grocery to find a similar product. But I don't think I would have found a product as good and tasty as Dr. McDougall. The noodles are quick and easy to prepare and above all else tasty enough to satisfy my appetite. I was surprised that there were enough peanuts in every bite just like at a Thai food restaurant. Overall, I'm pleased with my order and the quality of the product."
1464,1464,1464,1465,4,These are super tastey! I would definitely recommend. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I wish they were bigger! :D
1465,1465,1465,1466,5,"Super tasty quick meal.  It's a bit small, but perfect for a lunch on the go.  Definitely not going to help you with any dinner hunger pangs though.<br /><br />The sodium is a little higher than I'd like, but I really can't beat it for economic and efficient lunchfood."
1466,1466,1466,1467,3,"I like the concept, and I like Asian food, but the ""roasted peanut noodle"" variety of this McDougall's entree doesn't have enough peanut flavor for me.  Sauce is rather thin, too, and the flavor's fine--just not sure I could identify it as peanut.  I'll try a different variety next time, I think."
1467,1467,1467,1468,3,"Tastes great. Price is okay. Received in timely manner, but two of the soup packages were bent. Hope the price comes down."
1468,1468,1468,1469,5,"There are many workdays when I only have a few minutes for lunch or (all too often) dinner. On these days, Dr. McDougall's products are lifesavers! I keep some fresh, washed veggies in my office fridge and can have a great meal ready in 5 minutes. Just microwave this one, for instance, while cutting up some broccoli, peppers, a carrot, and whatever else I have around (I also added half of a slim yellow squash the other day, cut in little ""twigs"" - delicous!) By the time you're through cutting, you'll have finished with cooking the soup and the soup's ""standing"" time will be almost over. (It needs a few minutes to thicken up.) Take a tablespoon of the broth and a tablespoon of water, add the veggies and the liquid to a big bowl, toss the veggies in the liquid, and microwave for about 1 minute 30 seconds. When through, dump the soup and noodles on top and you have a delicious, healthy meal. The men in my office come sniffing around when the aroma of the soup comes out of the microwave -- several are now also fans, despite being initially worried by the fact that the meal is vegan. When I am organized enough to remember to wash and bring it in, I add a spring onion on top (I just use an office scissors to cut it.) If you can afford the calories, a few drops of toasted sesame oil is a nice addition, as well, as is tamari. YUMMY!"
1469,1469,1469,1470,3,"For a 220 calorie dish that can sit in your desk drawer indefinitely, this really isn't bad. It's certainly better than Chef Bouyardee or Easy Mac or actual Cup of Noodles. I've only ever had one other Dr. McDougall's product which was the Tortilla Soup and I much preferred it. I found this one to be a bit bland. It was pretty much just dried Cup of Noodles type noodles with some peanutty powder and a few green onions. I think the peanut flavor could have been more pronounced and I wasn't crazy about the texture of the noodles. I guess I was hoping for a bit more than ramen with peanut sauce.<br /><br />I only gave this three stars because I thought it was a bit of a let down. I liked it but I didn't love it as much as I should have given my love of peanut sauce. I would maybe buy it again at a grocery store if it was on sale but I certainly don't see myself buying them in bulk from amazon. My go-to Desk Drawer food is still Annie Chun's Udon Noodle Soup Bowl. The calorie count is pretty similar (I think Annie Chun's is like 280 or so) but the texture of the noodles is far superior because they use the vacuum sealed pre-cooked noodles. However, if you're not in the mood for soup, these peanut noodles may be a better way to go after all."
1470,1470,1470,1471,3,"first time I've tried this item, it's just ok, the broth is tasty but the noodles are pretty bland to me"
1471,1471,1471,1472,2,The noodles for this product are what make me gag.  I am not a fan of this meal at all and I &lt;3 Asian food.  For those looking for a delicious snack who are not already 100% vegan - I would either A) go try 1 first or B) skip buying this package as it is not delicious.
1472,1472,1472,1473,1,"I read the reviews for this product and had high hopes for a healthy, decent tasting cup of noodles. Needless to say I found this not to be true. First, the consistency is gross and second, the taste is awful. Maybe I am just not accustomed to eating crap. Think twice before ordering this product. I wish I did."
1473,1473,1473,1474,5,"These papers are great, they leave a delicious strawberry taste on your lips. Even the glue tastes good."
1474,1474,1474,1475,5,"These smell so good and are cute and a great size, with a bend in the middle to help roll, and holds together really well with tasty glue. Definitely recommend. Smell like strawberry bubble gum, doesn't really affect flavor too much, but better than plain ones and very sweet. Box says ""printed with soy ink"" so it's clean and I don't have to worry about ridiculous chemicals for the graphics."
1475,1475,1475,1476,5,These rolling papers are great they taste amazing and they burn slow and also prevent tar from running down the paper
1476,1476,1476,1477,5,"Love this soup.  I have been eating this soup for a long time. I have tried several different soups with these same types of ingredients, and this one is the best by far.  However, I will not order it from Amazon again.  I ordered a case, two different times, and the first time 6 of the 12 cans were dented.  The second order, the postal worker delivered it to me in a plastic trash bag because 2 cans were busted open, the other 10 cans, were dented with the labels coming off of them because of getting wet from the soup that had leaked from the busted cans.  It was a huge mess to clean up.  They need to package items better.  Amazon did issue a full refund, but after having 2 out of 2 shipments being damaged, I am not willing to order soup, or any other food items from them."
1477,1477,1477,1478,1,"This coffee supposedly is premium, it tastes watery--very thin.  Not good at all.  Maybe old??<br />Not sure, it was a waste, and I'm using it line the bottom of my sitting shoes and trash cans and rained-on luggage, to absorb the smells.  So I used it, but not to drink.  Do not buy."
1478,1478,1478,1479,5,"Excellent. Very nice, rich and creamy with the pistachio nut in the middle. mmmm.....  Delish!!!"
1479,1479,1479,1480,5,"If you want a good quick cooked sauce without excess acidity these are the ones to use. The real San Marzano, beware of imitators!"
1480,1480,1480,1481,5,"Long ago I discovered that San Marzano tomatoes were unparalleled for flavor when it comes to making sauces. I tried many brands, and have done many side by side tasting comparisons, and Cento San Marzano tomatoes have consistently won out. These tomatoes have a deep and rich flavor, and a nice acid to sugar balance (though you may need to enhance this when making a sauce). It's pretty obvious when you pull these tomatoes out of the can that they were picked at their ripest, due to their deep red color and soft texture. Many tomatoes advertise themselves as San Marzanos, but since SM is a type of tomato, they could have been grown anywhere. Not these. These are SM tomatoes grown in the San Marzano region of Italy, in volcanic soils perfect for growing tomatoes. I have no affiliation with Cento, I just love a perfect tomato sauce. Use these tomatoes, be sure to not cook the sauce for more than 15 minutes, and you'll see what I mean. Even using fresh, locally grown, in-season tomatoes I haven't been able to get the depth of flavor that I do with the Centos."
1481,1481,1481,1482,5,"I wanted to make authentic italian margherita pizza at home so I ordered this and Caputo ""00"" flour.  These tomatoes are amazing,  and taste just liek the tomatoes at our favorite Italian pizza restaurant.  The label says there is basil in it but i did not detect visually or in taste any basil.  This stuff is jsut awesome.  I ordered another 8 cans.  Shipping kills though."
1482,1482,1482,1483,3,"My sister and I did a blind taste test with these to see if the price was worth it, and we couldn't tell the difference between these and the two other brands I had on hand. I wouldn't buy them again."
1483,1483,1483,1484,5,"As I was growing up my mother always made apple sauce cake for every birthday and special occasion.  After I was diagnosed with celiac I began trying to make a cake that was like the one my mother made.  After 6 years I gave up trying.  Then I saw this mix in the store 2 years ago and got very excited with the prospects.  When I make the cake I tweak the mix recipe a little. I add to the dry mix 1/4 cup coco, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 raisins. I use 3 large eggs, 3/4 cup apple sauce, 1/3 cup of oil and 1/3 cup water instead of what is listed on the bag.  This cake and the chocolate cake mix also made by Namaste are our family's favorites.  This includes my husband and children who are not celiac and are VERY picky eaters!"
1484,1484,1484,1485,5,"I served this wonderful cake at a Christmas party at my house.  As the only celiac in the crowd, I decided to wait until the others had tried it, before revealing that it was gluten free.  Everyone raved over the great taste!  The package included directions for making the mix into a carrot cake, which is how I served it.  My own two boys said it was the best cake I had ever made, including the traditional wheat flour cakes I sometimes make for the rest of my family.  It was moist, spicy, and rich.  It reminded me of the cakes my grandmother made when I was growing up, and she was a terrific cook.  I highly recommend this one!"
1485,1485,1485,1486,5,"This product arrived with the sanitary seal in place and in good condition.  After nearly 10 months in Iraq, being able to shake pepper out of this thing and smell it in the air is heaven compared to the tiny little pepper packets they give us that have little to no taste.  I really do love the smell of this pepper and it tastes great.  You may be better off buying it in the grocery store and not paying for shipping if you can manage that, though =)"
1486,1486,1486,1487,5,"Not wanting to pay $9 per pound at the local mall for black jelly beans, I came to my favorite online store, Amazon. With free shipping I could not beat the price. I went from paying $9 per pound to $3.50 per pound. I was afraid that maybe the good deal meant that they were stale but to my suprise they were fresh and delicious. I bought them for my mother for Mother's Day because she did not get a chance to buy any for Easter. With 10 pounds, I had plenty to share with my friends too."
1487,1487,1487,1488,5,These jelly beans are wonderful.  They are smaller than regular jelly beans but that doesn't take away the flavor.  I would recommand these to anyone.
1488,1488,1488,1489,5,"Licorice Jelly Beans use to be my absolute favorite in the jelly bean flavors (I no longer eat sugar).  These were bought as a gift, so I did get to try a few just to see how they  are.  I've had many over the years before giving up on sugar and honestly have never had any with this good a flavor!  Also their customer service is excellent! I needed to contact them and they were very responsive and also willing to do just about anything to make sure even ONE customer is happy - something lacking in most companies these days.<br />To compare - I tried a couple Jelly Belly licorice ones and to me they had a fruit flavor that was just wrong - not enough of a licorice taste.  Gimbal's is less expensive this way and superior in every aspect of a licorice jelly bean.  This is a LARGE quantity!! Keep that in mind when purchasing - either have a lot of jelly bean lovers in your life, or a large family or collection of friends to share with - unless of course your sweet tooth won't stop and then, just savor them all yourself ;-)<br />Enjoy!"

1497,1497,1497,1498,5,"MY QUESTION FOLLOWED BY THEIR REPLY - VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!<br /><br />Hey guys,<br />So we are trying to feed a new born as much breast milk as we can, however there is not enough to meet his nutritional needs.<br />So a formula is in order as a supplement. With that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the FDA Infant Formula Guidelines, that it should be safe, (and opinions on the Internet seem to feel the same way). However, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. He was also concerned about using the DHA/ARA supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!<br /><br />THEIR ANSWER<br /><br />Dear Dave,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Nature's One®.  Firstly, you are correct in that our Baby's Only Organic® formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the FDA's Infant Formula Act. No dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. Please follow label mixing instructions.<br /><br />Regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in Baby's Only Organic® formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. The American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Panel for Nutrient Levels in Infant Formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 Calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 Calories. Phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. The Expert Panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. Baby's Only Organic® falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 Calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5.<br />Reference: Committee on Nutrition, Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009, pages 1245-1246.<br /><br />The balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in both Baby's Only Organic® formula and Enfamil NextStep is 1:5. Thus, Baby's Only Organic® formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus.<br /><br />Regarding our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA/ARA supplement, The DHA utilized in our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA & ARA supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. You are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. Additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. Because we use the phospholipids (not protein) from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue.<br /><br />If your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your child's healthcare provider.<br /><br />DHA is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. Dietary ARA is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. As your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. Other natural sources of DHA would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. Unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. But, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids (nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their cold-pressed oils). By including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needs<br /><br />Most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare.<br /><br />Proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. Egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. These protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin.<br /><br />However, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. The literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as Bird-egg syndrome. This is a very rare syndrome.<br /><br />Egg allergy can also be seasonal. Oak pollen, short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season.<br /><br />The estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1.6% by 2.5 years of age. (1) Again, egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy. Most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age.<br /><br /> (1) Eggesbo M, Botten G, Halvorsen R, Magnus P, ""The prevalence of allergy to egg: a population-based study in young children,"" Allergy 56; 5:403<br /><br />I hope this information is helpful to you.

1498,1498,1498,1499,5,"HANDS DOWN the best formula on the market.  Sadly, my breast milk dried up so I had to fine a formula.  My poor son has so many GI, stomach, gas, crying, reflux, etc issues.  We were on Alimentum for over a month.  We even tried the ready to eat b/c I heard it was corn free.  I also tried the hypoallergenic version by Enfamel.  Nothing made him better.<br /><br />After researching DHA/ARA...I found some scary things.  Basically, it is made by using chemicals.  There are some babies that have had a horrible reaction to this b/c of the toxins.  You can google it.  Anyway, I found this organic formula that didn't have it in it (you can buy DHA/ARA seperate made from eggs organically and no chemicals).  I was nervous...b/c my son had so many issues...I didn't want to make it worse.  But I tried it!  Seriously, it has changed my son's life!  He is a completely different baby!  I no longer even give him acid reflux meds anymore...I mean of course it is still there...but that is how much better it is.  My son has been on this since he was 6 weeks.  I know it says toddler, but if you go to their site it is FDA approved for infants.  They say toddler b/c they fully support breast feeding for the first year.  It has the same cals, fats, nutrients, vit, minerals pretty much as the other leading brands...it's just organic...no DHA/ARA..and they don't use corn syrup.  Seriously, try this formula!"
1499,1499,1499,1500,5,"I can't believe I am the first to review this great product.<br /><br />We have been using <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM4JLC"">Earth's Best Organic Infant Formula with Iron, 25.75-Ounce Canister</a> (which is also a great product) up until our little started showing signs of lactose intolerance. After consulting with the pediatrician, we started searching for a suitable alternative.<br /><br />Whilst Soy formulas are being offered as the ""lactose free"" alternative by many, our first preference was ""non-soy"" alternative. We also wanted a natural & organic product, free of those nasty chemicals and ingredients. After a considerable amount of research and shopping around, we found this was the best choice out in the market that was both lactose free and natural/organic.<br /><br />Our little one also took to this formula very well and doing a lot better on this formula."
1500,1500,1500,1501,5,You can find this 6-pack for $40 dollars less at diapers.com.  No reason they should be charging this much.
1501,1501,1501,1502,5,"Our 9 month old originally was spitting up a lot. We had him 1st on Similac regular, then went to Similac Sensitive and finally to Similac Soy.  The soy did the trick. He was on similiac soy for the past 6 months. When the Similac recall went through, my wife became disgusted with Similac and suggested we try a new brand. I was reluctant but did so anyway.  We reminded ourselves that as babies get older, they become less fussy, less gassy and maybe they don't need SOY anymore if that's what they were used to. So I went to my local Whole Foods store and bought the Lactose Free Baby's only formula. AN instant hit !!!!! My son loves it ! Seriousely. He gobbles it down...all 6 oz in once shot. Before with the similac soy, he would have to take a break in between.  My wife actually tasted the milk and said it is delicious compared to similac soy.  Well, if adults like it, I am sure babies would too !  I am very happy thus far with our choice. We were going to get Natures Best, but read that the way they extract their DHA is not ideal. Glad I realized that.  So far so good ! We always thought that our baby would be stuck with SOY formula...thank's to the similac recall and some good old fashioned parent intuition, we realized that is NOT the case.  I am happy about that since SOY can cause some hormonal problems.....babies and adults alike.  Thank you Baby's only for making an excellent product !"
1502,1502,1502,1503,5,"When my daughter was an infant, she was allergic to something in my breastmilk and was put on Neocate which worked wonders for her allergic colitis.  For my son, we were therefore very careful when it came time to picking out a formula to supplement breastmilk.  His stomach does react when I have accidentally had more dairy than I can tolerate so my pediatrician recommended a lactose free formula, especially given our Asian background.  I wanted something organic, not soy, lactose free, and with as clean of a label as possible and this formula fulfills all of those criteria.  My son didn't like it at first, but now he switches easily between breastmillk and formula.  He has not been gassy nor spit up on it.  I really wish Amazon stocked it."
1503,1503,1503,1504,5,"I love pasta, but it does not love me.  I just don't seem to be able to digest it.  But this pasta, not only tastes great, it is so easy to digest.  And, as an added bonus, it is healthy & low in calories.  I have now tried every version of this pasta & they are all amazing.  Some reviewers complained that the pasta is too firm, but that is not the case.  You simply need to cook it a bit longer than regular pasta & then it is light as a feather. Because of how wonderful it tastes & because it is so light, you would think that you were eating homemade pasta.  Almost hard to beleive that this stuff comes out of a box! :-)"
1504,1504,1504,1505,5,"I eat this pasta every day, without guilt. I love this pasta. I maintain my desired weight without any problem. You have to cook this pasta a little longer than normal pasta, but it is every bit as good."
1505,1505,1505,1506,5,"Each box is 8oz and usually I make 8oz mixed with some lean protein for a meal for both my husband and I, and if we have leftovers, it's rare.  This time however, I had half of it leftover only b/c we felt full and couldn't eat anymore.  I wonder if this is b/c of the high amt of fiber. Whatever, this morning my hubby tells me he's down 3 lbs. too.  I'm jealous. Also, I've been on an eating binge almost 2 weeks, always feeling unsatiated. Last night I had no strong urges to eat snacks.  I ate an apple more out of habit to eat something than b/c I was truly hungry. I won't say this is the outcome for everyone, but I thought I'd share.  I'm using the leftover pasta in my bean soup tonight. I'd like to eventually try the different varieties of shapes of pasta now, too."
1506,1506,1506,1507,5,I love this stuff and only get it through Amazon.  It arrived on time and good condition and I enjoy it.
1507,1507,1507,1508,5,"Just a quick note... a very good friend of mine who also battles weight issues and love pasta turned me on to this product.  We bought a box at Whole Foods and I was impressed by the taste but especially by the low calories and high fiber content.  Amazingly it's about 40% cheaper at Amazon than at Whole Foods, and being an Amazon Prime customer saved me on shipping.<br />I'll be back for more soon.  I love quality and a bargain."
1508,1508,1508,1509,5,"Love this pasta.  I mix this with regular pasta for a meal, half and half.  Love the lower calories and the fiber content."
1509,1509,1509,1510,5,"My husband and I have been on a low carb diet for two years and I miss pasta most of all. We've tried other low carb pastas and weren't crazy about them, but we loved Fiber Gourmet. The taste is midway between white and whole wheat pasta. Unlike other low carb pastas, we didn't experience any side effects in terms of digestive issues (if you know what I mean). I can't wait to try other products from Fiber Gourmet."
1510,1510,1510,1511,5,"Love this pasta.  Does cook up a little firm, cooked it a bit longer. Had it with pesto very good.  My husband could not tell the difference so I know it is good.  He is very fussy."
1511,1511,1511,1512,5,"Wow ... this pasta tastes just like the real thing unlike the brands labeled as whole wheat pasta. I tried them many times and simply could not get the same pasta-eating experience.  I eat half the box at a time, which is about 4 ozs, and it's so filling I can't eat more if I wanted. It keeps me satiated all night. I don't even get the urge to snack. This is like a miracle to me.  Even my children who are the absolute pickiest eaters in the world love this pasta and will eat it in substitute for the ""real"" (and unhealthy) alternative. The other reviews are absolutely correct in that you should cook it 2 - 5 minutes longer than you would cook other pasta or even what the box says.  I'm not sure if Amazon will like this comment, but it is much cheaper on the Fiber Gourmet web site at about double the amount for the same price on the day I am writing this review."
1512,1512,1512,1513,5,I am on a low carb diet and have lost 25 pounds.  I was so tired of eating meat all the time but too nervous to splurge on pasta until I came across this product on Amazon.  I cook it a minute or two longer than the directions and top it with full fat Greek yogurt and parm cheese and one serving is so filling and yummy.  Definitely cures my cravings and am now on subscribe and save.  My hubby and son love it too!
1513,1513,1513,1514,5,I don't know how they do it but this product is too good to be true.  Half the calories of regular pasta!! Wow.
1514,1514,1514,1515,5,Great product.  Recommended by Dr. Oz.  We love pasta but not the calories.  This is much better than whole wheat.
1515,1515,1515,1516,5,I brought a box with me to visit my daughter and family.<br />We all enjoyedjthe fiber gourmet light penne  very much.
1516,1516,1516,1517,3,It is a good tasting product.It does not raise my blood sugar as much as regular pasta but you still can't eat a whole box and expect your glucose levels will be normal.
1517,1517,1517,1518,5,"First of all, it is wonderful to have these pods delivered to my door free of charge.  On auto delivery, they are cheaper than the cheapest Senseo pods that I have found (Target/Walmart).  But check out the weight of coffee per Senseo pod vs. this particular Baronet coffee pod.  Not all Baronet pods are this weight, however, so check out the products carefully.  I guess I had better mention that the coffee flavor is great!  One order is for three boxes of these pods."
1518,1518,1518,1519,1,This coffee is absolutely horrendous.  I cannot believe it has any favorable reviews and agree with the other reviewer who believes positive reviews were written by employees.  I cannot stress enough how bad this coffee is.  It doesn't even taste like coffee.  The best way to describe it is a cup of chemicals.  I am really bummed I cannot returned this.  A complete waste of money.  It all went in the garbage.
1519,1519,1519,1520,5,"These pods are so much better than the Senseo pods!  At 10 grams, these pods are packed with more coffee than the Senseo pods, making for a better, stronger, more flavorful cup of coffee.  I use these in my Melitta One-One.  Also love that each pod is individually packaged, so they stay fresh.  They come in a stand-up box dispenser which is nice too.  I can't understand the other reviewer here who didn't like the coffee - I love this decaf!  It really is the best pod I've found.  Also the value here can't be beat.  Comes 3 boxes in each order, so in each order you get 54 pods!  And Baronet has so many flavors.  Do check on the other Baronet flavors, though, because all the Baronet pods are not 10 grams, and all the pods don't come individually packaged.  Stick to the 10 gram, individually packaged pods, you won't be disappointed.  I get three different Baronet coffee pod flavors, all on auto-delivery.  Highly recommend.  Yum."
1520,1520,1520,1521,1,"The flavor of these pods is horrid.  I ordered them only because Senseo was out of stock for so long, and I needed some decaf pods, and these had received a couple good reviews (which I now suspect were written by Baronet employees).  I have never tasted such awful coffee before. A big ""YUK"" for Baronet."
1521,1521,1521,1522,4,"I am enjoying this coffee but the vanilla is a little overpowering.  The strength of the coffee itself is very good.  I can use one packet to make 2- 4 oz. cups with the Senseo coffee maker so it definitely saves me money.  Plus, it is just so easy to make coffee and clean up in the morning!"
1522,1522,1522,1523,5,"I had been using <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBH9YE"">Senseo Decaffeinated Coffee, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 6)</a> in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043XYLAA"">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup Stay or Go POD Brewer</a>. Although the Senseo coffee is very good, I wanted some variety. This is what I found and its excellent. The vanilla flavor is rich and most importantly, leaves no after taste. I drink tall cups, 16 oz, so what I am doing is using 1 of each type. The vanilla is strong enough that it still tastes great. The Senseo decaf is a little cheaper, so I do that as a cost saving measure. I also signed up for Subscribe and Save to further reduce cost.  If you like vanilla coffee and have a pod brewer, I am confident you will love this coffee."
1523,1523,1523,1524,5,So many different flavors to choose from.  I ordered this brand for the first time and the taste is wonderful.  It was the only decaf french vanilla I could find.  I have decided to switch from my old brand to this one.
1524,1524,1524,1525,5,"This by far the best pudding mix, you don't see this on the store shelves.. Everyone seems to just buy milk chocolate pudding.. and I guess most don't like to cook pudding on the stove, it is best when pudding is cooked cooked.. Instant pudding does not equal this..  Carl"
1525,1525,1525,1526,5,We've been searching everywhere locally for this putting.  I was so elated to find it on Amazon.  This is the only pudding my mother made her chocolate pies with and now the tradition continues.  Thank you so much Amazon!!!

1527,1527,1527,1528,5,"My honey has a serious sweet tooth, which I accommodate by preparing him a weekly dessert. Martha White's Muffin Mix is very convenient to prepare because it only requires one-half cup of milk, which I toss into my cuisinart; and wah-la six beautiful muffins with virtually no prep time. They are moist, delicious, and economic."
1528,1528,1528,1529,5,i followed the easy instructions and these turned out delicious. i ate them all. there were only 6 of them. i mixed 1/2 cup of milk into the dry mix and slowly mixed it together. i poured the mix into my sprayed cast iron 6 cup muffin pan. i cooked them in my small convection oven and they cooked up nicely. they were moist on the inside. the mixes were very fresh smelling and had a freshness date well into 2013. the pouch is a nice tough plastic one and will keep the mix fresh. it is very easy to open also.
1529,1529,1529,1530,5,"WE LOVE LOVE LOVE these muffins. They are moist and delicious !! We like them best the day you bake them. The 2nd day they do dry out a bit but are wonderful if you pop them in the toaster oven for a few min to warm them up, then they are good as new. Our only complaint is that they are DIFFICULT to find !! BUT DEF Worth every penny !!"
1530,1530,1530,1531,4,"This was my first time purhcasing muffin mix as well as baking muffins.  To me the muffins came out a little dry, but tasted great and the people I shared them with said they were good too.  I will, more than likely, purchase Marth White Muffin Mix in the future.  The muffin mix came at an excellent price and I can't complain.<br />Thank you Amazon.com for having most everything under the sun for sale."
1531,1531,1531,1532,1,"I tried the Martha White Turtle Fudge Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe and these are the worst cookies I have ever made. Either there is someone on the staff of Martha White who has a lopsided sense of humor OR their taste buds have taken a permanent vacation. I wasted my time, a lot of money on chocolate and pecans,and my effort.Martha White either needs to tweek this recipe or take it off the website so no other unsuspecting housewife will waste her money and time on these worthless cookies. My husband picked up one on his way through the kitchen and within two seconds he came back in and threw it in the garbage."
1532,1532,1532,1533,5,"I brought 2 bottles.  One I carry in my pocket and the other for home.  I fell in love with this while on vacation in Belize.  Just a couple drops does the trick.  Packs a ton of flavor, but not too hot that it overpowers your food."
1533,1533,1533,1534,4,"Good product and decent shipping. However, the price was $15.95 and I later found the same item in a local store for $6.95. What a gouge."
1534,1534,1534,1535,3,"Not bad for a prepackaged and quickie meal. If you're looking for authentic Thai, this will give you only half the flavor, so the name that it is only a taste of Thai is quite accurate. Cartons are fancy, but big for the amount they hold. It is definitely enough for a meal, but if you're looking for a full takeout carton of food to eat, you had better grab two. It is tasty enough for a meal, but if you can get yourself to an authentic Asian supermarket, I guarantee you will find much tastier options that are also quick and easy to make with more substance and flavor and at a much lower price (ie 6 boxes of noodles for $6) - and I'm not talking about Cup O' Noodles or things you find at American supermarkets. But overall, my husband and I, being the noodle-mongers that we are, did enjoy these as something new for the palate. However, we will probably opt to order Thai takeout for fresh noodles next time we have a craving."
1535,1535,1535,1536,3,It's like eating a large box of paste.  I enjoy the flavor but I usually cook them and then mix with something else I'm eating as it's a no-go straight out of the box!
1536,1536,1536,1537,2,"I simply don't like it. It is easy to prepare, but when I eat it, I feel that i am eatting a lot of artificial ingredients. I cannot even finish one fourth of it....."
1537,1537,1537,1538,3,"Overall, this was good, but not great.  The ginger sauce seemed like it need an extra something to get it a fourth star.  I think I was expecting a little more ginger taste.  I'd buy it again, especially if I can find a good way to punch it up just a little more.  I may try that egg tip!"
1538,1538,1538,1539,4,"The Taste of Thai Coconut Ginger Noodles are really yummy! The coconut and ginger flavors are very mild.<br /><br />Each recloseable, Chinese-takeout-shaped box conveniently serves as a microwaveable container. One box makes enough for me to have 2 very filling lunches or for my whole family to share as a side dish. (The kids always lunge at the opportunity to have these!)<br /><br />The only negative thing I can say is that I wish there weren't so many separate little seasoning packets to mix in (3, plus the noodles); a single combined spice packet would be easier. (Of course, one benefit of multiple packets is the ability to leave out a certain spice if you're not fond of it, but I like them all!)"
1539,1539,1539,1540,2,"We enjoy A Taste of Tai's Peanut Noodles... they rock.  That peanutty flavor...mmm... so we decided to try these... um, Ginger, not so much. Nothing really distinguishes these from any other noodle flavor, and the ginger is a bit overpowering.<br /><br />Take this review in stride though, if you're a Ginger lover (and I'm not talking Gilligan's Island here), then these may be right up your alley.  Just a bit outside for me, though (if I may mix my metaphors)."
1540,1540,1540,1541,4,"Provided you use clean (preferably purified) water to cook this, it can be a great tasting hold over to a main meal. Far superior to most instant noodle packages out there and for the most part, gluten and meat free (except for the shrimp flavor).<br /><br />While some people have remarked on the ""over-sized"" packaging, this actually allows for a good and thorough mixing of the flavor packets and noodles with little chance of spillage.<br /><br />While the coconut ginger variety tastes good, it may be a bit too subtle for those looking for an actual ""taste of THAI."" I'd recommend the Thai Peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced Thai flavor and highly recommend The A Taste Of Thai Peanut Salad Dressing (added to salads, meats or the Peanut Noodles) for a very spicy Thai experience.<br /><br />Overall for the taste and quantity, the subscribe and save offer provides the best deal. Comparatively speaking in terms of price, Wal-Mart offers most of these noodles a few cents cheaper (compared to the subscription price) but do not seem to carry the Coconut Ginger Variety. At least not at the store near me.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this brand of instant noodles yet, I think you'll be in for a treat."
1541,1541,1541,1542,5,I really like this soup.  It is mild and I don't like anything that is to hot.  IT is just right.  Has a good flavor and is something I can take to work and pop in the microwave. I would buy it again and again.
1542,1542,1542,1543,5,"This is quick, easy and portable, and I think it tastes great! It's my favorite flavor."
1543,1543,1543,1544,3,I bought these at walmart for less then $2.00 dollars a box.There over  $2.80 a box @Amazon for (box of six).Then you need to add another $7.00 dollars to your order to get free shipping ....I would not buy these again could be better if you added chicken or an egg like other reviewers mentioned. My box does say gluten free so maybe there are 2 versions.
1544,1544,1544,1545,3,"A year or so ago, I use to buy these quite often because they were gluten-free.  Last month I decided to order some again and this product no longer says ""gluten-free"" on the packaging and contains wheat.  I didn't want them to go to waste, so I ate one anyway.  I became very sick.  I do enjoy this product but will not be purchasing again because of the wheat.  Just a warning for those of you who also have issues with wheat/gluten."
1545,1545,1545,1546,2,"Thanks for the egg tip, it works very well and really helps this product.  Nevertheless, I ended up giving away three of the six containers because I was not thrilled with the nutritional information."
1546,1546,1546,1547,4,"It's very tasty and very easy to make.  If you're in need of a very quick, filling meal and it needs to be gluten free, this works out great.  Try the Thai Peanut one, too."
1547,1547,1547,1548,5,"We ordered a pack of these and ate through them very quickly! My husband and I both like taking them to work for lunch. Here's my recipe, so that I get more protein: I slip a fresh unbroken egg into the box before I leave home in the morning, then I add the egg to the water before I cook it at lunchtime."
1548,1548,1548,1549,4,Very tasty gluten-free option.  My kids loved it as it wasn't too spicy.
1549,1549,1549,1550,4,The Thai Coconut Ginger Noodles are quick and easy to prepare. You will be rewarded with delicious noodles to enjoy by yourself or share as a side dish with another noodle enjoyer.
1550,1550,1550,1551,5,I liked this so much that I re-ordered and will keep<br /><br />re-ordering.
1551,1551,1551,1552,2,"I had recently tried a similar product from Trader Joe's and, not having a TJ's around me presently, I decided to try this more readily-available variation.  I didn't really like this thing too much.  For starters, there is too much packaging for my liking.  Too many things to throw away.  And I agree with a previous reviewer that they're kind of big cartons for how much they hold.  Inside the container are 4 packages - one for noodles, and three for various seasonings.  Then you have to add water.  They give you a fill line, but it's kind of awkward.  Then microwave for 3 minutes.  Then stir, then microwave again for one minute.  The one from Trader Joe's only has two packets - one for noodles, one for sauce - and no water involved.  Just microwave for 2 minutes and you're done.  And those are a lot tastier.  I didn't like the texture of this thing (everything clumped together too much) and it really didn't have much taste, especially considering the three different packets of seasoning I put in.  Time to try a couple of the other brands of these things..."
1552,1552,1552,1553,1,I bought these for my son to take to work for lunch. Apparently his co-workers found the smell so offensive they asked him not to eat it at work again. Maybe it was a bad batch...
1553,1553,1553,1554,3,"I don't plan on reordering it, but it was definitely edible and filling since I added chicken."
1554,1554,1554,1555,1,"I tried these as I love Thai food, ginger and coconut. That was my problem, as this mess does not even vaguely resemble Thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste. Plus, the noodles stick together, even when prepared as suggested, and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them.<br /><br />Also, the nutrition label is misleading. I am dieting and read labels very carefully. This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz (half a cup). I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package. Not so, one package is actually two servings, or over 500 calories. This is far more than any other pre-packaged noodle meal I have seen.<br /><br />The excessive calorie content might have been OK had the product tasted good, but it doesn't. I would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess."
1555,1555,1555,1556,5,"This is a great and delicious way to eat Thia food at home.  Just ""melt"" the entire packet (if you like it spicy) into two cans of coconut milk in a pan.  Then add your favorite meat and veggies.  I usually use chicken strips and a bag of frozen asian veggies."
1556,1556,1556,1557,5,"While the restaurants always do it best, these curry pastes are pretty tasty. It's easy to use,  fast, and you can add the meat and veggies of your choice. For those of you scared of something spicy, you might use a little less, but for most, it's just right, and for those that like it spicier, you can add a little crushed red pepper. Since the coconut milk has to be added separately, you can also control the fat content--you can go light or go with the much yummier, creamy stuff. I find the green curry is a little sweeter than the red and panang curries, and is maybe a little less spicy."
1557,1557,1557,1558,5,Much hotter than your normal green curry. One pack makes many servings.
1558,1558,1558,1559,4,"Used to use another brand (that changed), in a jar, but this is so much better! Has a very pleasing hot spicy taste with a hint of lemon/lime and a good amount of heat. It is a little too salty though, if you like to use a fair amount to ""spice it up"". We wish it had a lower sodium content. While, made from scratch with fresh ingredients is always better; this is the next best thing! Really good with chicken, beef, pork, tofu and veggie dishes. Quick and easy to make good-for-you meals. We don't like the packaging and wish it were in a jar, but other than that and the sodium content, we like it. Will buy again!"
1559,1559,1559,1560,5,"Second order.  Very good, hot which I like but best to sample as per your preferences."
1560,1560,1560,1561,5,"I was really impressed with this.  There are many flavors, and quite a bit of heat.  With this and your favorite brand of cocunut milk you can make some great Thai curries at home."
1561,1561,1561,1562,5,"Different flavors for different people.  Not everyone is going to like this just as others, like me, will love this coffee.<br /><br />It's totally subjective.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars.  I enjoy this coffee a lot and the price is very reasonable, in my opinion.  It matches my local big box grocery store."
1562,1562,1562,1563,5,"I was at a 5 star hotel and was served this tea during a meeting.  It was fantastic.  I asked the server if they could get me the name of the company, but they were unable.  Thank goodness for Amazon I was able to find it.  It's the best I have had in many years.  It arrived on time and very securely packed."
1563,1563,1563,1564,5,"I totally love this tea.  It brews to a beautiful reddish color.  It is very aromatic and beautiful to look at.  It could be potpourri.  I love the sachets it comes in - very elegant.  I just bought my third canister of it this morning.  I have everyone at my office and my friends loving it, too!  Best with honey pearls also sold by White Lion Tea.  And it's organic!"
1564,1564,1564,1565,5,This stuff rocks!!! I've had it at two different spas and I just love it. It's tart and really unusual. A real treat.
1565,1565,1565,1566,5,This is my husband's new favorite tea! I'm not huge on hibiscus but this does taste good. I'm sure we'll be buying more.
1566,1566,1566,1567,5,Nice tea. I can steep up too 3 times. It has a strong cranberry flavor. Probably would be good as a cold tea. I recommend if you LOVE cranberry.
1567,1567,1567,1568,5,"I found this tea 5 years ago, while staying at a Spa Resort in Washington.<br /><br />I absolutely love it! It's herbal, and helps me to relax with its very flavorful taste and color. Great for colds, as well as clearing the sinus. Soothing, beautiful, and delicious!<br /><br />I have ordered this tea every year, from Amazon.com, because the price is amazing, and well worth it. Likewise, I've given it to others as a gift, when I can afford to.<br /><br />This tea is wonderful with honey, sugar, sweetener, or just by itself! A must purchase for every household. Also great for on-the-road, for tea drinkers."
1568,1568,1568,1569,5,"Love it, love it, love it!  Both me and my 10 year old drink this herbal tea quite often.  Very tasty!"
1569,1569,1569,1570,5,This is very good tea in an elegant sachet. A little pricier than some but produces a wonderful flavor whether you're drinking it hot or cold.
1570,1570,1570,1571,1,Found this product for sale on vacation in North Carolina and loved it... great maple flavor!! Walmart sold it for 3.99$ for the 24oz pack. Wish i would have bought some more while I was there because i'm not paying 15$ for what Walmart can sell for 4$. That is just robbery... very disappointed in @#@zon for their insanely high price... If price was reasonable would love to buy more and rate much higher!!
1571,1571,1571,1572,2,"I had high hopes when I ordered this tea, as years ago in San Francisco I used to buy a lovely rose black in Chinatown which was my favorite tea ever. Unfortunately, this blend lacks body and is very high in caffeine. I prefer the opposite, a full-bodied tea I can brew strong without sending my blood pressure through the roof.  But for someone who wants a light tasting tea with a powerful caffeine punch, this might be a good choice."
1572,1572,1572,1573,5,"My doggie really likes Newman's Organic better than some other dog foods pet and big-box stores sell. My budget doesn't like Newman's Organic as much as Harmony Farms. It's the compromise that keeps the doggie AND my budget happy.  Because he eats it heartily, I don't worry that he's getting enough high quality food.  Otherwise he won't eat his food and he'll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void.<br /><br />There's no barfing, digestion problems or accidents. High Quality food means good digestion, a shiny coat, high energy, bright eyes and a good attitude WITHOUT tons of additional elixers, treats or vet bills. A definite cost effective WIN:WIN for doggie AND me.<br /><br />I've had great results with Newman's Dog Food that I orderd through Amazon BUT there's 5 pounds LESS for about the same price.<br /><br />Psst I'm not an organic fanatic, it's the nutritional value that counts for my fur baby and human kids!<br /><br />Update 3/26/2011: Noticed this has jumped to almost THIRTY BUCKS, will opt for Newman's Organic when the costs per pound are the same...my dog likes BOTH Harmony and Newman, my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase :)<br /><br />Update 5/17/2012: Last batch Of Harmony Farms I ordered had a rancid oil smell when I opened the bag and the pooch wouldn't eat it as readily as he has in the past. He wouldn't eat for a day and started checking out the trash. I subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods, cooked brown rice etc as mix-ins to ""encourage"" him to make it through this pricey bag. Not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home, BUT the Texas heat can make anything stale/rancid/yucky quickly. I probably should have called Customer Service but felt the replacement would have the same issue due to the HOT weather here. Definitely exploring hot weather alternatives."
1573,1573,1573,1574,5,"A few years back, prompted by the death of one of our dogs due to an inoperable brain tumor, I switched my dogs to foods without corn.  I was convinced, right or wrong, that my animal died needlessly because of an over usage of steriods prescribed to cure her constant ear infections.  I believe, again right or wrong, that the recurring ear infections were caused by an allergy to corn...which turned out to be the main ingredient in her food!  Sorry, I'll get off my soapbox and address the issue at hand...I found this food by accident.  The only type the store had was the weight loss formula.  Turns out my dogs love it!  I haven't seen them so spunky and full of energy.  I've got a coon hound and two jack russells (mine are not the ""bounce off the wall kind"", mine are mellow, laid back kinda dudes!)  They gobble this stuff up and seem to stay full...no more begging in the kitchen than normal! Everyone's skin seems smoother, eyes are brighter, heck, I think I'll go have a bowl!  All I can say, is if you are looking for a good quality dog food, this is the one for you.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
1574,1574,1574,1575,5,"I have a 2 year old Portuguese Water Dog who always seemed to have a sensitive stomach, and a 15 year old Shepherd X dog who was beginning to lose weight, she slept almost all the time, and she was getting very fussy about what she'd eat. (I believe that with a dogs sense of smell they KNOW exactly what is in their food; however they have no choice but to eat what we feed them...just Google what is in most commercial dog foods, and you'll see why your dog may not be thrilled to eat it up...if a dog can detect cancer in a person, they can detect all sorts of other things that aren't supposed to be eaten.) Anyway...I used to feed Purina lamb and rice to my dogs, but I was finding my young Porty was having trouble with it, and my 15 yr old would eat a few bits and then leave her dish. So, I started making their food, and came up with a wonderfully nutritious and tasty recipe. The dogs loved my homemade dog food, and my 15 yr old began putting on weight again, but I didn't always have time to make their food. And, homemade dog food is kind of hard on the wallet. So, I started to research all the natural dog foods out there, compare costs etc. I arrived on Harmony Farms, and guess what...my dogs LOVE it just as much as they love my home made dog food. My young Porty no longer has stomach troubles and she looks great; my 15 yr old finishes her meals and looks for more. Both have shiny coats and energy. No one can believe my old girl is 15 years old. I have told my friends about Harmony Farms dog food, and when they've switched over, they've reported similar positive results. My brother-in-law's dog had always been a very fussy eater, and had skin problems with a thinning coat. When they started to feed her Harmony Farms, she became an eager eater, more happy and outgoing, and her skin and coat condition has completely cleared up (...I'm thinking she had an allergy to whatever was in her other food, which I think was Iams). Other friends have commented on how happy their dogs are at meal time now...and they had all been feeding their dogs premium, top of the line dogs foods AND paying top of the line prices. Harmony Farms products are very reasonably priced. Not the cheapest dog food on the shelf, but, in my opinion, you are buying the best quality food on the market, so it's an incredibly GOOD DEAL! It may also mean you make fewer trips to the veterinarian's office. I and my friends are so happy we have found this food for our dogs. :)"
1575,1575,1575,1576,5,"My co-worker that does animal rescue brought in a 'Whole Dog Journal' recently and I was astounded at the feature article for that month which covered dog foods, I had been feeding my dog Beneful which is basically just junk food.  I switched her off immediately, hunted around on Amazon to find an all natural food and this fit the bill, shipping was free which was awesome and my dog LOVES the food, I worried about that b/c I've switched her before and she's been uninterested and I've had to top with gravy, etc.<br /><br />Do your research, it will blow your mind what your pets are eating in regular grocery store dog food, it's typically a high ratio of corn which is a filler.  If you want your pet to live a long and healthy life what they're ingesting should be high up on your list.  I'm glad to have the knowledge now and I really wish I'd looked more into this with my two other dogs years and years ago."
1576,1576,1576,1577,5,"No more heavy grocery bags for me -- I've just ordered my first bag of Harmony Farms dog food -- and it was delivered to my door by UPS.  The food is excellent quality -- I bought this product based on its healthy ingredients; the dogs love it and I love Amazon for making it so easy to buy!<br /><br />July 2010 - one of my dogs has had bouts of inflammatory bowel disease:  previously she had to have special food from my vet (Royal Canaan Duck & Potato for the past 4+years) -- She has tolerated, even thrived on, the Harmony Farms food w/o any problems. Each bag of Harmony Farms is about $20 cheaper than the Royal Canaan.  Hard to fight.  I am a believer.<br /><br />The canned food is great, too.<br /><br />September 2011 -- my dog who has had inflammatory bowel disease in the past (verified by surgery) has never felt better -- she is a wire and has the energy of a 2 yr old dog (she is 7); she is not on any daily medication.  This HEALTHY WEIGHT FORMULA has helped her to thrive.  Enough protein, not too much fat seem to do the trick. I highly recommend it."
1577,1577,1577,1578,2,I was giving my shihtzu the Fromm Adult Gold dog food. She didn't seem to want to eat it though so I thought I would try something different. I found the Harmony Farms and thought I'd give it a try. She actually liked it. It's cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients. I couldn't believe how she gobbled this up. BUT after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach. Took her off and the rash went away completely in 2 days. Her hair also wasn't as soft. This kibble did not do well for her.
1578,1578,1578,1579,5,"I was using Castor and Pollux from Amazon for my dog and I decided to try something different.  My dog dug into this dog food right away!  It has helped to maintain her rough coat so that it is softer and smoother.  And this food really helps keep her weight at a healthy level.<br /><br />I catch my cat sneaking over to my dog's food bowl and eating this food, too.  I have to look into getting her some Harmony Farms!  I can do this because Harmony Farms is really good quality food that is affordable."
1579,1579,1579,1580,5,"I just ordered this, came today and thought I would just try it, well to my amazement,My little Daisy ate it and wanted more.My little Dog is just 8 yrs but has trouble with Flare-ups with her pancreas, I have to avoid fats and corn with her and she needs more fiber. I have been making her dog food ,but she missed eating the dry,I wondered if it was small enough for her to chew , but it was."
1580,1580,1580,1581,5,Had been feeding my 3 hounds Purina One (which they liked) and thought I'd try this since it's not much more and I liked the ingredients. They LOVE it and I plan to order more in the future!
1581,1581,1581,1582,5,"Everyone should know this is a healthier dog food than walmart brands, like purina, iams, or god forbid moist & meaty. Ingredients like ground flax seed, peas, whole carrots, whole sweet potatoes, apples, blueberries and probiotics and the lack of sweeteners, by-products, and low-quality corn show this to be true.<br /><br />I just did a taste test with this harmonic farms and my dogs old iams ProActive Health and decided to make the results known. I let him smell both thoroughly without letting him eat at first, and placed the two piles a bit apart. He immediately went for the harmonic farms, finished it and didn't even look at the iams before coming back to me wagging his tail hoping for more.<br /><br />Dogadvisor.com made me aware of my past mistakes in dog food choices and I was hoping to god he would not shy away from the healthy organic stuff like I do. To my great welcome surprise, he didn't! I guess he's a hippie at heart. I on the other hand, will take my nachos bell grande."
1582,1582,1582,1583,5,"Our ten year old doxie...Annie NEVER, that's right, NEVER would eat ANY dry food UNTIL....Harmony Farms Healthy & Holistic Chicken & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food that we bought from you! Every day we are in shock when she finishes each and every nugget of this dry dog food! Amazon...you are truly amazing and we are so grateful that we bought this 17.5 pound bag of Harmony Farms Dog food from you...we'll be ordering again and again from you as soon as we head towards the end of the current bag.  Wow! So happy about this..."
1583,1583,1583,1584,5,"Harmony Farms produces EXCELLENT dog food products!  Our 8 month soft-coated wheaten terrier is sensitive to gluten, corn meal and other products generally found in the popular  brands.  We were preparing to take him to the vet at about 4 months old b/c he had great difficulty eliminating -- to the point of whining as he would attempt to go.  After more research on the breed we purchased Harmony Farms at a local store -- it was expensive but quickly resolved our puppy's digestive issues.  After 5-8 days on only Harmony Farms products our puppy was happy and healthy!<br /><br />I was so happy to find Harmony Farms on Amazon!  It is more economical AND delivered right to our door.  Our puppy, Connor, eats only Harmony Farms dog food and treats and is a much happier puppy now. Definitely recommend it for soft-coated wheaten terriers and other breeds that have difficulty digesting the popular brands."
1584,1584,1584,1585,5,Wish I would have known a long time ago what a difference this dog food makes. My 6 year old Jack Russell has always had the worst shedding problem and I recently read that excessive is a sign of poor nutrition (was feeding her P*urina dog chow). She's only been on this dog food for two weeks and I can noticeably tell a difference in the shedding! She loves the taste and I love the price for such a good quality dog food.
1585,1585,1585,1586,5,"When I purchased the Harmony Farms Healthy Weight Formula, I had a Mini Dachshund and Jack Russel Terrier.  Both of them love it.  I have added a Shih Tzu to my pack and she loves it, also.  I would highly recommend it to others.  The kibble is just the right size for small dogs."
1586,1586,1586,1587,5,"The main ingredients in this dog food are so much better than the ingredients in the common grocery store brands, and it tends to be less expensive than specialty brands.  My dog's coat looks shiny and he seems much healthier since we switched to this food about a year ago.  The other nice thing is that Target sells this brand, so if you ever find yourself at the end of the bag and you haven't ordered more in time, you can stop by Target."
1587,1587,1587,1588,5,"I am very pleased with this dog food. My sheltie has a good coat and good movements with Harmony Farms. Does much better with this food than others. He is a very picky eater, so I do add chicken and he will eat. We will stick with Harmony Farms. I also like the bag, it helps keep the food fresh."
1588,1588,1588,1589,5,"My dog loves this food, and she has maintained her healthy weight for many years.  The vet is very happy with her general health, coat, and teeth.  Having the 16lb bag sent directly to my home without any shipping charges is terrific!  The 16 lb. size is not available in my area."
1589,1589,1589,1590,5,"While on a family camping trip with Josh our 8yr old Golden, we ran out of dog food. Stopped at a Wegman's market in Erie PA to shop for a quality food. Settled on the Harmony Farm's chicken. Josh liked it right away.<br />We've been mixing it with his normal food (Canidae).<br />He's very healthy and playful, his coat is shiny. He's a happy pup."
1590,1590,1590,1591,5,"My dog loves, loves  this dog food.I had to say love twice, because this dog food is one of his dog's favorite."
1591,1591,1591,1592,5,"I have purchased this product once before from Amazon.  It was delivered promptly and in tact.  This is the only food our dog will eat and we used to purchase it at PetSmart in New York but in Arizona, it is no where to be found.  This food is holistic and has no unnatural products at all.  We try to give our dog good quality dog food and this was it.  So now we go through Amazon and our dog is quite happy.  Bought a double amount to receive free shipping.  It was a very good deal."
1592,1592,1592,1593,5,"I have a nearly 1 year old golden retriever/standard poodle mix, and a 6 year old german shepherd. The doodle gets the chicken and  brown rice (just switched her a few weeks ago from Nutro Max) and the shepherd gets the healthy weight. I have tried several different foods for the doodle, and many of them caused problems like diarrhea and stinky, stinky farts. With this, while switching from the Nutro Max, she had none of those problems. In fact, I only took 5 days to switch her instead of 2 or so weeks, and she didn't have any digestive problems. Both dogs seem to like it and it is definitely cost effective... several dollars cheaper at my local Wegman's and there are always coupons in the paper. This is a very high quality food for the price, and I like that it's available at the grocery store as I live in a small town. I highly recommend this food and hope to feed it exclusively for as long as my doggies shall live!"
1593,1593,1593,1594,5,My dogs have been eating this brand for a few years now and having found it available through Amazon I am able to save money per pound and trips to the store. It arrives promptly and is the same quality as always. Harmony Farms is much easier to digest and healthier than most commercial foods. LOVE IT!
1594,1594,1594,1595,4,"I purchased this because of the good reviews and the great ingredients. No doubt about the quality of the food and my 5 month old dachuhund puppy loves it. But I realized this doesn't have DHA that helps to develop cognitive brain function. Also the kibble might be little big for a puppy. So I believe it's a great food for an adult dog, but I wouldn't recommend it for a puppy."
1595,1595,1595,1596,5,"This dog food satisfies both of my dogs and they have had no digestion problems or skin issues , as they have had with other brands.  They both have maintained healthy weights and glossy coats on this food. I have been very pleased with the automated delivery service."
1596,1596,1596,1597,5,"Since I live in a rural area sometimes I'd drive to town just for dog food...needless to say that was expensive.  For $26 w/free-shipping the Harmony Farms is cheaper than the purchasing the lower quality ""name-brands"" - my dog likes the food and his skin is not as dry & flaky. I love getting it shipped directly and that my dog is eating something healthy.  Very thankful it's something I can afford as well.  Only wish Amazon offered a 'subscription service' for this item like they do on others."
1597,1597,1597,1598,5,"I am always pleased with the variety of shopping items, that I find on Amazon.com.<br />I have never been disatified with my purchases through Amazon.com.<br />When searchomg for things, even dog food, I automatically go to Amazon.com<br />before any other site. Rarely do I chose another site.  Amazon.com<br />really rocks.  Thanks for being there!<br />J.Meadows, Syracuse, NY"
1598,1598,1598,1599,5,I just switched my 11 and a half year old Boxer to this food and it is awesome! She switched over no problems with no weaning off her old food. It has cut her gas down and has been so easy on her stomach. It also tastes so good to her that she will eat it without wet food mixed in. I wish I had found this food 11 years ago. It is great and we will switch our Boxer puppy to it when it is time. Also...very affordable:)
1599,1599,1599,1600,5,"In my opinion, this is the best food for dogs.  My boyfriend is an avid researcher, and he concluded this is the bet food for dogs on all accounts - taste (the dogs love it), health-wise (it has healthy fats, and the first and main ingredient is meat as opposed to ingredients such as corn) and digestion-wise (the dogs get diarrhea when they eat human food or any other dog food).  We have two dogs we adopted from a shelter, and while at first, one of our dogs would not eat the food (he had worms though, so who knows what junk he was eating before), he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon, he came to love it.  Now they jump when it's dinner time!  Our dogs are happy, very healthy, have shiny coats, and a large part of this is due to this fantastic dog food.  We get it on Subscribe and Save and we usually go through 1 bag p/ month - for reference, we have one 15lb Bichon and one Alaskan husky."
1600,1600,1600,1601,5,"I have 2 husky/shepherd mixes. The first is 13 months and has a finicky stomach - if he eats too fast, drinks too fast, or eats anything out of his routine, he would bring it back up. He also wouldn't eat more than a few nibbles at a time. The 2nd is 7 months old and came to us with severe diarrhea (vet's food didn't fix it either). He would eat anything and everything if we let him. Within a day of both dogs being on Harmony Farms (No fasting, just a quick switch), both dogs digestive issues are gone. My oldest (the finicky eater) is healthily eating his meals without pause or hesitation. My youngest has solid, regular bathroom breaks and has been able to relax his water intake as a result. They're both more relaxed.<br />We purchase at our local grocery store (Hannaford here in NY) for about $1.31/lb. For the price, ingredients, and results - you can't beat it."
1601,1601,1601,1602,1,I read the reviews on this and thought id get some for my dog and pup.<br />They will not touch it. Even if I mix it with home cooked food.<br /><br />They like the dollar store dog food better than this.<br /><br />Amazon let me down on even allowing this dog food to be sold under their name.
1602,1602,1602,1603,5,"These chips are wonderful.  My kids and I all loved the salt and pepper.<br />Each .8 oz bag was 100 calories, lots of chips for the calorie count."
1603,1603,1603,1604,5,"Great packaging, and item is just as described. Will purchase this item again. They were shipped very fast, and efficient."
1604,1604,1604,1605,5,"Just to give a little background - I ordered these because they were a great deal for a box of single serving chips and I thought I would give them a try.  The variety of flavors in this package was great and I enjoy most of them.  These chips leave a lot less mess than your average bags of potato chips and there are very few crumbs in the bag.  It is apparent these are not prepared like normal chips and the result is a differently textured chip.  It will be a personal taste as to whether or not you will like the taste and texture, but, I would highly recommend trying these out."
1605,1605,1605,1606,5,Got this item on a one-day-only sale on Amazon.  Love having the single-serving portion as I am following WW plan.  Only 3 points plus per serving.  Tasty and on the same line as the Special K crackers.  The variety is nice to have and the box will last for awhile.  Cheddar and BBQ are my favorites.  Try them...
1606,1606,1606,1607,5,"I discovered Pop Chips awhile back and fell in love with the BBQ flavor- whole lotta flavor and satisfying snack or chip alternative. Hubby is a teacher, so he gets lunches made most days with healthier and tastier options than what is offered at school.<br /><br />Since I mix up his sandwiches offerings from week to week, I thought the variety pack would be different for him. He gets his crunchy fun and doesn't realize the Pop Chips aren't as bad for you than the reduced fat kettle chips he was getting. Score! Plain are fine, vinegar pack a tart punch and he really likes the salt and pepper flavor. Single serve size does leave you wanting more if consuming solo, but gives a good amount when enjoying with a sandwich."
1607,1607,1607,1608,4,I really liked these chips as did my entire family. I wish you could pick and choose the flavors in the variety pack. I would love to try the sweet potato and chili lime and leave the salt and pepper behind.
1608,1608,1608,1609,3,These popchips were something I wanted to try because they were baked. The barbeque ones were okay but the rest of them were terrible.
1609,1609,1609,1610,4,"I like these Pop Chips a lot, but not all the flavors.  This variety pack makes a good sampler of the various flavors and then you can purchase the flavors you like.  These chips have strong flavor and are not greasy.  They are fairly filling and make a great snack.  They're pretty noisy (like most chips) so don't take 'em to the local theater!<br /><br />These came well packed and they are in stay fresh packaging.  I can attest that they do keep well for a pretty long time as I found a bag that had gotten pushed behind some other things, and after several months it still tasted fine.  ;)<br /><br />These are a pretty good size for a quick snack.  Quality has been consistent over several different batches.  I really like the texture and crunch, and love the lack of greasiness."
1610,1610,1610,1611,5,"These tastes good. If it's not fried, not bad for you, and tastes good, then why not eat them? Of course, not a lot at once, but these are great healthier snacks."
1611,1611,1611,1612,2,"I bought two bags of PopChips at Whole Foods (Original and Barbeque)and loved them.  When I went to Amazon to order lots more, I liked the idea of single serving bags rather than the larger ones, which I'd consume too quickly.  I knew I was taking a risk but when the order came, I really disliked about half of the flavors in the assortment.  In addition, only the Original and Barbeque nutritional values calculated at 2 pts; the others were all 3.  I still like PopChips but will only buy bags of the flavors I know I will enjoy eating and not have to choke down.  I recommend that you try a bag of each flavor before you spring for a volume order."
1612,1612,1612,1613,5,"I had only tried the barbeque and sea salt and vinegar flavors that were available at my local Target in 3oz. bags.  I am so glad that I bought this variety pack! Not only did I discover other flavors that I enjoy, but it's single serving size so it's better for portion control.  I love popchips, and I find them way more satisfying than ordinary potato chips!"
1613,1613,1613,1614,5,I like these chips a lot! Now i have a whole 24 pack ! this is how i get my chips on while i Fish!
1614,1614,1614,1615,5,A while ago I got a bag of the BBQ at a store to go with my lunch and I loved these so when I was searching amazon and found these on subscribe and save I knew that this was something that I had to have for my lunches. I love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet I have not found a flavor I did not like. Being from England I am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as I would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors I can't complain. I also love the fact that 5% fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack. My only issue now is that I have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as I do. I have now had to go to a box a month but even then I am not sure I can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can.
1615,1615,1615,1616,4,"Good flavorful chips - too bad the selection does not include jalape&ntilde;o or paramsan garlic. Packaging is difficult to open, but they fresh."
1616,1616,1616,1617,5,"These are a great alternative to traditional greasy potato chips.  Great for people that are dieting but still craving a salty, crunchy snack.  They are light and crunchy and they taste really good. I was afraid they were going to be like the rice cakes and soy chips but they really taste good.  The original flavor reminds me a lot of the Munchos chips.  The original flavor and salt/vinegar are my favorite but they are all good.  My least favorite is the cheddar just because it is an overwhelming cheddar flavor (I don't like cheddar) but most people really like it. I have purchased these several times now and I will continue to do so.  I  highly recommend this product for anyone!"
1617,1617,1617,1618,4,"For all of you potato chips lovers who are trying to eat healthy, these chips are a great alternative!  No they are not like fried, but the flavor along with the calorie/fat benefits make this a great choice! I liked having the variety pack for the opportunity to see which flavors I would like. As it turns out, I like them all! But I do have my favorites (like BBQ, salt & vinegar, and plain) so being able to buy them singlularly is an added plus.  I have already placed two orders since my initial purchase!"
1618,1618,1618,1619,5,"I got these for my gf as she isn't supposed to eat any gluten.  All of the flavors taste great and they seem to be much healthier than regular potato chips.  If you are looking for a gluten-free snack, I highly recommend Popchips!"
1619,1619,1619,1620,4,"I like all the varieties except the salt and pepper.  They taste too much like black pepper and nothing else.  The others are very goodl<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVFDOO"">Popchips 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a>"
1620,1620,1620,1621,5,"The products are wonderful and fresh!!  Everything reported about the chips is on target, and I would recommend them to others.  Amazon's services are fantastic!!"
1621,1621,1621,1622,5,I really enjoy these low calorie chips.  They have a good flavor with a good crunch and are crisp.<br /><br />I was wondering if when ordering a case of these chips one could order their favorites and not the whole 6 flavors?  Say just 2 flavors if desired??<br /><br />Its a great product. don't stop manufacturing them.
1622,1622,1622,1623,5,"These are really good tasting chips, they aren't too unhealthy so you can eat a fair amount. Love the flavoring."
1623,1623,1623,1624,5,"I have been trying to find healthy snacks that taste good and boy have I found a great choice in PopChips!  These are a great healthier alternative for regular potato chips.  I love Special K cracker chips, but they only come in big bags.  I saw these and they are packaged the way I like (individual serving bags), so I gave them a try.  Now, I will never be without them!  They are sooooo good and there are a lot of chips in each bag.  Finally a good-tasting, healthier potato chip that I can enjoy!"
1624,1624,1624,1625,5,"I wasn't sure about these chips, but thought I would give them a try. These are tasty, crispy chips - and only 100 calories a bag! I like all the flavors included in the variety pack. I definitely will buy again."
1625,1625,1625,1626,5,"These chips are very tasty,  Its a nice size serving and only 100 calories.  Good grab and go snack for busy Moms"
1626,1626,1626,1627,3,"I agree with many of these reviews.  The product tastes good - not fantastic but good.  I don't like real, greasy potato chips and prefer Baked Lays.  However if you do enjoy real, greasy potato chips, please see the review referencing Pringles and Steven Baldwin.  very funny.<br />Do buy these if you like an ocassional salty snack but don't want to devour a large bag of fat-filled chips.  Don't buy these if you are looking for a healthy alternative to chips - eat a banana or apple instead (and not those apple chips or banana chips because they are high in sugar).<br />If you do get the big box - just put it some place inconvenient like the basement where you will have to exert some energy in order to get them - and if you do, BONUS! you just exerted energy and maybe earned a chip or two."
1627,1627,1627,1628,4,"The PopChips were great and they were fresh when they arrived. For the price, I wish there were more bags of chips for my bucks."
1628,1628,1628,1629,5,Aboulutely love Popchips!I first tried these healthy chips at a marathon i did in California. I like this variety pack because i got to try alot of the flavors ive never had.
1629,1629,1629,1630,5,This product was everything and more according to the advertisement.  I was totally satisfied with my purchase.  I recommend to everyone to purchase these chips from this site.
1630,1630,1630,1631,5,Popchips is a new product for me--ordered after seeing an ad in Weight Watchers magazine.  Loved the product.  Packing was perfect.  Shipping went fine.  No complaints with this order at all.  Probably will order again soon!
1631,1631,1631,1632,5,"I have to watch my calories, but I tend to not be very successful if the food I eat is tasteless.  I have enjoyed all six flavors of these Popchips and feel great eating them at 100 calories per bag.  My favorites are Sour Cream & Onion and the Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors.  In fact, they're so good I just want to keep eating them; and have to resist opening a second bag, because that really defeats the purpose!  I like the variety pack and it's not a bad value."
1632,1632,1632,1633,4,The product is exactly what it is portrayed to be. Tasty (not yummy) but good. I received the product promptly. I ordered 2 cases and will eat every package.
1633,1633,1633,1634,5,"I love these chips, they taste so good I am on a low cal diet and they are perfect. The individual bags keep you honest. Thank you PopChips"
1634,1634,1634,1635,5,These are delicious.  My husband and I just love them.  Especially the BBQ and Salt and Vinegar flavors.  I like the individual packages.  It's a wonderful bargain when you get free shipping!
1635,1635,1635,1636,4,"I'm a crunchaholic! I have to have something during the day to crunch! All other chips are so high in fat or sodium that it makes it very difficult to be eating healthy and still get my crunch on. PopChips is the answer and the individual bags are a great way to control your calories too! I highly recommend them all, but the salt and pepper are my least favorite!"
1636,1636,1636,1637,5,These are the best snacks for me as I am a lap band patient.  They fill u up just enough and the small bags are perfect size
1637,1637,1637,1638,3,"Yum! I had tried the original and the Bar-b-q and really liked them so decided to get the variety pack. For whatever reason the 24 pack is cheaper then the 12. The flavored ones do contain a yeast extract which is similar to MSG and gave my grandmother a bad headache. So if you know anyone that has a sensitivity to MSG, do not give them these.  These are tasty and a nice substitute for a greasy potato chip but they are not filling. You are better off eating a granola bar."
1638,1638,1638,1639,5,A dream for those on Weight Watchers who love potato chips. The individual serving bags of Pop Chips are only 3 points and taste delicious.
1639,1639,1639,1640,5,These are a Great size and healthy.  They satisfy the craving for something crisp and are reasonable calorie wise.
1640,1640,1640,1641,5,These chips are GREAT substitute for the usual high calorie ones offered!  I keep them on hand to aid in my weight loss venture.
1641,1641,1641,1642,2,I bought these and tried each flavor. I could not even finish any bag but the barbecue. I really liked the barbecue but all the other flavors were gross. And the texture is really like fingernails on a chalk board to me. HOw is this the #1 best-selling item? Amazed. Anywho to each his own! Godbless and enjoy. But if you are like me and enjoy barbecue just get the barbecue kind!
1642,1642,1642,1643,5,"I can't believe these are actually decent for you.  They taste awesome!  I love these chips, they have great crunch and a great amount of flavor.  I am addicted to these and so is my boyfriend (who hates anything that's healthy).  I recommend these to all my friends.  I'm on the auto refill program but keep having to reorder early since my bf keeps eating them all."
1643,1643,1643,1644,5,"I am on weight watchers and these chips are only 3 points and they taste GREAT.  I like every kind,  I use the plain chips to dip with my salsa.  I would recomend these chips to everyone weight watchers or not."
1644,1644,1644,1645,5,This is a great product. I was a chip-a-holic and knew I needed to cut back on them. Then I was introduced to pop-chips.I have found my alternative. These chips are great! Low in fats but high in flavor. I purchsed a mixed case with multiple flavors and was not disappointed with any of them. Consider this product for your alternative to the high fat chips available everywhere. I am sure these will catch on and become a big hit.
1645,1645,1645,1646,5,"Saw these in Whole Foods and thought they looked interesting. Didn't care for them instantly, but by the time the first bag as gone (I have a husband and kids), I was hooked. Wanted to try other flavors and this is a great way to do it. Personally, I like the plain and also the salt/pepper. My kids love all of them though and, while these aren't fruit/veggies, I feel better about giving these to them as opposed to standard chips."
1646,1646,1646,1647,5,"We received our assorted single serve packs today. This is the first time we ordered Popchips. They taste so good. We are already down by 5 packets between adults and kids.<br />Please bear in mind that these chips will in no way compete with ""regular"" fried potato chips. The low calories per bag is very much a part of why they deserve 5 stars. I'm sure we will be ordering more. Yay to finding a new healthier snack alternative."
1647,1647,1647,1648,5,"I wa hesitant about ordering this product simply because I never ordered snacks of the internet,  so after finally decided to order it. It arrived within 3 days! the flavor is awesome! just like what I hoped for! if you like health food or like potato chips but hate thinking about how oily they are after eating them then this product is for you! if you are happy with the regular potato chips and doesn't care about the the oil and calories then stay where you are! those chips have so much flavor! they kinda remind me of rice crackers but with flavor! I have lived in the U.K. for a while and one thing I have always missed is the crisps that I used to eat in U.K. those popchips reminded me of the taste of the crisps! I will be order those again!"
1648,1648,1648,1649,5,"I am a huge fan of Pop Chips. They had them at my grocery store, but their supply was dwindling, so I was afraid they weren't planning to order more. I purchased two cases (48 individual bags) of Pop Chips. They are all excellent. Purchasing them in the Variety Pack gave me access to flavors they didn't have at the grocery store (salt and vinegar, cheddar, salt and pepper). I've enjoyed all the flavors! (Barbecue is still my favorite, though.) I also got a better deal buying them online."
1649,1649,1649,1650,5,"I have this on a monthly reoccurring purchase making the per unit price even lower that list.  That being said, Pop Chips are very tasty and the variety pack comes with 6 different flavors.<br /><br />My favorite flavors are Salt & Vinegar by far.<br /><br />The calorie count makes this snack a very guilt free affair!"
1650,1650,1650,1651,3,Definitely better than Pirate Booty and slightly better than Baked chips. Very tasty but you feel as if you're almost eat something with the same texture as cereal. It's a small payoff to enjoy chips (albeit faux chips). The Vinegar and S/P ones are NASTY!
1651,1651,1651,1652,4,"I bought the 6-flavor variety pack.  They are pretty good... nice thing is that I'm not 100% sure if I'm crazy about the texture so by the end of an 0.8 oz bag I don't really want anymore.  However in my quest for different snack foods I found the ""Food Should Taste Good"" line of cracker chips.  My money will be spent on those rather than pop chips.  However I think that people should give these a try as well."
1652,1652,1652,1653,5,The BBQ chips are great.  We liked them better than regular chips.  They have a nice crunch.  Hate Kettle chips which are so hard that they are like eating shards of glass.<br /><br />We will definitely be buying more of the Popchips.
1653,1653,1653,1654,5,These really are good I gave some to other people and they liked them too. The plain flavored ones take well to using them as scoops for your own dip or salsa. When eating the BBq flavored ones brings back memories of yester years when I would eat BBq pork skins while riding in the back of the truck on the range. I think the pepper ones could use more pepper but they are all still good and make a good snack or side dish to lunch at 100 Cal per pack.
1654,1654,1654,1655,5,"To those of you, and there's a lot of us, who are constantly watching our weight and calorie intake,these chips are A-1 in my book.<br /><br />First of all, the flavors are incredible, very tastey and enjoyable.  The single serve bags are just the right amount, and a very nice portion might I add, and the calorie intake is only 100 calories for the entire single serve bag.<br /><br />I'm so happy I tried them, I bought the variety pack of single serves and I can't say enough good things about them.<br /><br />They're crispy and crunchy and the flavors aren't to salty, just right.<br /><br />So to those of you who enjoy a nice crunchy savory snack, you can't go wrong with POPCHIPS!!!  I'm hooked, now I just have to make sure I limit myself to only 1 - 2 bags a day!!!<br /><br />They really are good and the nutritional information isn't bad at all.<br /><br />So WOO HOO for those of us who can't sit down with a big old bag of Herrs or Utz and just can't seem to stop ourselves from putting our hand back into the bag over and over and over again, don't get me wrong I'm not bashing on Herr's or Utz, I love them both, however they're much higher in calorie than the POPCHIPS.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favor and give them a try, you truely can't go wrong, even my friends/family, who don't have to watch their calorie intake, enjoy them as well, so that's saying something.<br /><br />Hope to read other reviews of happy calorie counting snackers!!!!!<br /><br />Keep on Munching, the Healthy way with ""POPCHIPS"" snacks."
1655,1655,1655,1656,5,"Found these while looking for good, cheap, low-calorie snack packs to buy in bulk for my office.  After my first shipment, I decided to have two boxes shipped to the office monthly via subscribe & save.  My next shipment arrives in two days. I'm so excited!<br /><br />Gotta have my pop chips..."
1656,1656,1656,1657,5,My husband and I both really like the popchips.  They are a great substitute for regular potato chips and we both find them very satisfying.
1657,1657,1657,1658,5,"I read a reference to these on Jillian Michaels's website, checked out the Popchips web page, and liked everything I read. But the proof is in the tasting, of course. They arrived today and the consensus here in this house is that Popchips are incredible. They taste SINFULLY good, crunchy and just yummy. I love sea salt and vinegar chips in general, and truly LOVED the popchips version. Anyone on Weight Watchers plus will be happy to know that a single serving bag is only 3 measly points. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!"
1658,1658,1658,1659,5,What a great way to help with dieting and keeping on track.  These are very tasty and crunchy - great with sandwiches or salad or even by themselves.
1659,1659,1659,1660,5,"My whole family loves these ""chips"".  I am following the Weight Watchers plan and the whole bag is only 3 points, there is quite a few in the bag totally worth it!!!"
1660,1660,1660,1661,5,"i am trying to eat healthy and could not really find any good tasting low fat snacks. my friend told  me about pop chips that she bought from amazon. she said she loved them and i should give them a try, i said what the heck if she likes them they must be good. and what do you know i loved them and i have a bag almost everyday for a snack"
1661,1661,1661,1662,5,"The only complaint I have with pop chips is that I can't get all of the flavors at the stores where I live!!! My husband and I both LOVE pop chips, his favorite is the salt and pepper and mine is the sour cream and onion.  Pop chips are a perfect mix between a chip and a rice cake!!!! We cannot say enough good things about them!"
1662,1662,1662,1663,5,"I LOVE PopChips.  They have a great crunch without the greasy feel and taste.  They are very similar to munchos--very light and fluffy.  If you are looking for something to satisfy your salty craving, these are a great way without having to feel so guilty about consuming an enormous amount of calories."
1663,1663,1663,1664,4,The original flavor would work fine with any dip and are okay on their own<br />The salt and pepper flavor is AWESOME.  Really tasty and a great snack for only 100 calories<br />The sour cream and onion is a little chemicall-y but decent.<br />The barbeque is good but not tasty enough.  The flavor doesn't go as well with the texture.<br /><br />Haven't yet tried the other two flavors.  Will update as I do.<br /><br />If you haven't tried popchips they are sort of a cross between pringles and rice cakes.  Less like styrofoam than rice cakes and made with the same potato flakes kind of texture as pringles without as much fat.<br /><br />So far I have this on subscribe and save and will keep that subscription active.  These definitely beat a 150 - 300 calorie bag of potato chips as a snack.
1664,1664,1664,1665,5,"I bought these when they were on a Gold Box deal...thinking that it would be a nice inexpensive toss in for a month of lunches...and then I'd never buy them again.<br /><br />Not so...<br /><br />They're actually really tasty!  Exceptionally crunchy!  And the flavor is similar to kettle cooked chips.  Definitely going on subscribe and save for a while.<br /><br />I don't think they're any more salty than standard potato chips...but they're by no means ""low salt."""
1665,1665,1665,1666,5,"Popchips are a great guilt-free way to add some crunchy satisfaction to your diet without added excess fat and sugar. They are clean, light, deliciously satisfying and are available in a variety of flavors.They would make a great lunch box addition. Popchips will be on hand in our home from now on!"
1666,1666,1666,1667,5,I received my box of assorted Popchips a few days ago to support my Weight Watcher meal plan.  I absolutely love them and find that they fit in with my plan.  Without hesitation I recommend all varieties of these chips.  What a great idea!!!
1667,1667,1667,1668,2,"Very tasty chips( ORIGINAL AND OTHER FLAVORS ),but ones with salt flavor way too salty.Not sure who likes so much salt in chips.."
1668,1668,1668,1669,5,"What a great snack!  I love these crispy, crunchy, treats.  Packaged in a single serve bag, I buy these by the pack of 24 assorted flavors so I have them on hand whenever I feel the urge to snack.<br />Unfortunately my family has discovered how good they are so they are now going faster than I had anticipated.  Time to order some more!  All the different flavors are seasoned just right--not too salty or spicy.  I love Popchips!"
1669,1669,1669,1670,5,"These chips are awesome. The light airy texture makes them a pleasant snack. I am dieting and thesse fit in reall nice. Gives me that salty, crunchy yummy taste that keeps my points low for the day. I love them. I have recommended them to all my diet buddies and they love them. I haven't tried all the flavors yet, only those in the variety pack but trust me I will be tracking them all down and hopefully find my favorite. That may be difficult they are all so good!!!"
1670,1670,1670,1671,4,"I tried these in Colorado and came home to find out they only sell them on the west coast. Amazon didn't sell the ones I wanted. I put it on a wish list as a gift for a loved one. Within a week of their birthday, Amazon e-mailed me that it was available. Great chips but, took longer to ship then expected. Just in the nick of time for the birthday. When you want something real bad, Amazon usually comes through."
1671,1671,1671,1672,5,We absolutely loved the chips and after ordering them from Amazon we were able to find them in Target.  They have a really good flavor and we would eat them even if we weren't trying to loose weight.  Recommended by weight watchers.
1672,1672,1672,1673,5,"Popchips are absolutely delicious, and getting the variety pack is great.  Everyone in my family has a favorite flavor.  Highly recommend these as they feed your chip craving, but are not nearly as bad for you as chips."
1673,1673,1673,1674,4,I really like the flavors and the fact that the chips are low in fat.  I especially like the bbq and salt and vinegar.  I don't care for the salt and pepper.  I wish I could get a multipack and choose the flavors I want.
1674,1674,1674,1675,5,We have played this with three adults.  fun game that does not take too long to play.  makes you think and plan only to have someone else mess up your plans.
1675,1675,1675,1676,5,That's all I can say. Yum at a great price! I can't find these sizes anywhere in my local grocery so this is just awesome.
1676,1676,1676,1677,5,"Great low cal snack... satisfies the crunchy, snacky, salty cravings without high calories.  All flavors are good;  The cheddar is a little too seasoned for my taste."
1677,1677,1677,1678,5,"I have a free sampling of these chips and I can see me swapping them for my regular chip cravings. They remind me of Munchos, but are less greasy. Try them."
1678,1678,1678,1679,5,If you haven't discovered Pop Chips yet - you don't know what you are missing.  Low calorie and high in flavor.  Great for the kids lunches. I need the single servings or I will eat the whole big bag.
1679,1679,1679,1680,5,"I am so happy to try and enjoy pop-chips. They were recommended on calorie count.com, products like this are not available at local grocers. Caloriecount.com mentioned the snacks were available from Amazon.com which we all know is easy to order and accept delivery to your door. The pop chips are delicious, they come in many flavors. I have ordered them twice and shared them with friends. We love the single serving 100 calorie packs. The treats are tasty and delicious. I am on an email list to alert me when the jalepemo flavored pop chips become available. Thanks Amazon! I am planning to order them again for snacks on a family vacation. The variety will make this a fun treat and when compared to other 100 calorie treats this product gets a 10/10 rating from our family."
1680,1680,1680,1681,5,"These have become a wonderful alternative to those afternoon cravings for salt, and or sugar.  They have texture and flavor, and a bag hits the spot.  I would highly recommend these if you are looking for an alternative to the junk from candy machines."
1681,1681,1681,1682,5,"I LOVE Popchips!!  These are the BEST.  Individual serving bags, flavors are great, taste is excellent.  My daughter and grandson love the barbeque.  I have found that buying them through Amazon is cheaper and Amazon offers the bigger bags also.  I have to watch that because I could eat the whole bag."
1682,1682,1682,1683,5,"I am a chip fanatic, when I heard of these, I HAD to give them a try! They are very tasteful esp. the bbq one's.  I have yet to try the other flavors but I am sure they will not disappoint.  I watch my weight/health so these are perfect, just becareful because they are addicting!"
1683,1683,1683,1684,4,"Good Variety of the flavors, makes it helpful to sample for your choice of type you prefer. Also good for packed lunches or as a portioned snack."
1684,1684,1684,1685,5,This is a great snack to have instead of potato chips. Lower in calories but still delicious. Will be ordering them again.
1685,1685,1685,1686,5,"I was very pleased with the popchips.  MY first order was before the chips hit the stores.  The taste is delightful.  No greasy taste. In fact the variety in flavors will keep your palate very excited!  Amazing how it is made.  Calorie count is great too! I went further to send the chips to my family they too were very pleased with them.  My third order I placed for a gathering of 12 friends.  They too, could not get over the variety of flavors and how they were made. I feel the product itself won over more prospective customers. Try it yourself, I know you will be very pleased.<br /><br />Trish Kowalski"
1686,1686,1686,1687,5,I love Popchips. They are delicious and I can't believe one bag is only 100 calories. The flavors are great although I am not a fan of salt and pepper. I would highy recommend as a way to try the different flavors. I am sure you will love them too.
1687,1687,1687,1688,5,"I hate healthy anything!<br /><br />But I am overweight, so I need an alternative to my normal routine of Doritos potato chips. The only reason I tried these chips is because of the other reviews, so I am contributing my 5 stars toward the product.<br /><br />From just looking at it, I was expecting it to taste more like rice cake... but I was pleasantly surprise. The chips tastes great, very crisp... I don't really know how to explain it.<br /><br />All the flavors are great. My favorite is the BBQ. The Original is a bit too salty, but still very tasty.<br /><br />Highly recommended! At least give it a try before disregarding it for being a healthier snack."
1688,1688,1688,1689,5,"I'm trying to eat healthier and one of the things I really love is chips and salty snacks of all kinds!  These Popchips really do the trick of satisfying my craving. Though I don't really care for the pepper flavor, I like all of the others.  I will buy these again."
1689,1689,1689,1690,4,I found these chips on vacation in Oregon.  The store was a kind of natural yet upscale type of grocery store.  I had never seen them before.  They are different than regular chips-no oily taste but very flavorful.  I didn't know if I could get them in CA so I ordered a case!
1690,1690,1690,1691,5,"These taste great and are a healthier alternative. My favorite was the sea salt and vinegar. I probably won't order the other flavors again since I have a favorite, and don't eat potato chips all that often. But the variety pack was great to get to try them all."
1691,1691,1691,1692,5,"These are great - my entire family loves them.  It is a great addition to my son's school lunch - and I have the satisfaction of knowing it is a better alternative then the normal ""chip"" out on the market.  Great flavor - BBQ and Sourcream & Onion are our favorites!  Love the single serve bags - wish you could buy them at the store - but for now I will continue to purchase on Amazon...  because of the great service and varieties!"
1692,1692,1692,1693,5,These chips are flavorful without all the fat of fried. I love love the bbq flavor.  I also like how the chips don't crumble in the bag.
1693,1693,1693,1694,4,These are great little snack packs - flavorful chips and fairly low fat and low cal.
1694,1694,1694,1695,4,"I tried this chips in a hotel that I stayed at, and loved them! I ordered them for the office and everyone enjoyed them. I'm on my second order!"
1695,1695,1695,1696,5,Popchips are very good.  The varity received lets you try the diferent flavors.  I only wish I could find them locally.
1696,1696,1696,1697,5,"These are the best chips invented for those who are trying to watch their calorie intake.  You get a lot of chips for minimal calories, and they taste great!!"
1697,1697,1697,1698,5,"Great selection of chips & very fresh. If you are are looking for a healthy alternative to fried potato chips & don't like the fake taste of baked, these are just the most amazing chips you can eat. I bought 2 cases & every time I'm at Target or our Super Box Store I make sure to pick them up!!"
1698,1698,1698,1699,5,"I agree with reviewers who enjoy this alternative to the regular salty snack options.  The texture of the chips is great and they're very flavorful!  I can certainly taste the sodium but if this isn't a problem for you, I would recommend trying them.  It's a snack I look forward to having a chance to enjoy.  Everyone has their favorite flavor (i'm no exception -BBQ FTW!) so I recommend trying the variety pack first.  I thought I'd have at least one or two flavors we'd 'hate', but no.<br /><br />My initial purchase of an alternative snack was Stacy's Pita Chips in Parmesan Garlic & Herb.  Nothing against them, but they lacked the flavor punch I was looking for.  These Popchips are exactly right.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend these chips for anyone who likes a salty, flavorful snack!"
1699,1699,1699,1700,5,"I loved these chips. They were exactly what I had been looking for. They are not fried/greasy or baked/dry they were great-tasting, satisfying, and healthy alternative to regular potato chips. You can feel good about eating these chips. Can't say enough, you'll have to try them for yourself! I am ordering more now!"
1700,1700,1700,1701,4,"Although I can not say that these are the same thing as potato chips, they are a good alternative and very tasty. The flavors are much like the potato chips you would get at the store; it is the texture that is different. They are less oil (a good thing) and lighter than potato chips almost like a rice cake except much thinner and crisper. All of the flavors are good except for the cheese one. I didn't care for it although my two-year-old likes it.<br /><br />All-in-all, for the calories, you can't beat it, and for long term weight maintenance and health, these are great and delicious as well. Amazon.com sends out a very fresh product that is as good as if you bought it from the shelf of your local grocery store."
1701,1701,1701,1702,5,The chips are very good and serve as a great snack with very low calories and Weight Watcher point value.
1702,1702,1702,1703,5,"I was on the fence about buying these for months. I read the reviews and were impressed by them but, the possibility of being stuck with 24 bags of chips I hated made me nervous. This was my first food order from amazon and I am glad I picked this product to be. I absolutely love these chips. I deiced on the variety pack to start with in case I didn't like one flavor had others I could eat. Turns out though I enjoy them all.<br /><br />They are thicker than your normal potato chip with a great crunch and more of an airy texture. One bag fills me up as a mid-day snack. The flavors themselves are a bit bolder than you would expect from a chip. For me this was a good thing. I would have to say the bbq is my favorite. The flavor reminded me a lot of lays bqq but a bolder version of it, the sweet bqq flavor with a bold kick at the end. My bags had very few broken chips in them. Everything about this order was great.<br /><br />My father was around when I was trying my first bag, making fun of them cause they were healthy. I offered him one and he accepted probably to do some dramatic spitting it out and eww effect. He looked at me confused once he ate it, promptly took the bag out of my hand and walked away with it. This is a man who HATES anything healthy, but shows how good the flavors are.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying these again."
1703,1703,1703,1704,5,"I picked up a 3 oz bag of the Salt and Vinegar chips last weekend at Wegman's and in a blink of an eye, the bag was GONE.  Very nice vinegar flavor.  Bad side was in a blink of an eye they were gone which is not good for portion control.  I ordered the variety pack in .8 oz size (single serving) to help with portion control.  Most of the flavors I like - but fair warning, the parmesan garlic is VERY garlic. Love the salt and pepper.  With 100 calories a pack, what a nice change from baked chips.  Try it - you will like it."
1704,1704,1704,1705,5,"Popchips are really, really good! Don't expect a regular old, greasy potato chip, but DO expect something equally AWESOME that stands on its own. Popchips don't leave any funny residue in your mouth like some other ""diet"" chips, and they don't have a lot of fat and calories - only 100 cal. per single-serve bag! I got the variety pack, and liked every one of the six flavors - some better than others (because I'm not a big fan of cheddar chips by ANY maker, so these were as good as any), but all were good, most were GREAT. Even non-dieters who tried them liked them. It seems like they cost a bit more than the average bag of chips, but maybe that's because I had to buy a case. Even so, they're worth it if you're fighting the battle of the bulge and want a lo-cal indulgence you wouldn't otherwise be able to enjoy. My recommendation: EAT POPCHIPS!"
1705,1705,1705,1706,5,"Here's the straight talk from a foodie, not a Top Chef food critic, but a foodie:<br />-Name: Pop Chips. They are cooked in a kettle with pressure and heat. Fantastic. Not baked or fried. Made by the company POP CHIPS so it isn't frito lays or mars trying to forcefeed America in disguise.<br />-Packaging and Branding: Colorful and way too heavy-duty bags. This is why they are slightly expensive. Similar to kettle chips packaging. You will have fun opening the bags with a POP. Packaging was great. I've eaten about 6 of the small bags and not one was even slightly damaged.<br />-Taste and Texture: They are about the size of half-dollar coins, kind of puffy like a pork rind or rice cake, and they are not crunchy hard like potato chips but they do crunch. Definitely distinctive and they deserve a place on the market.<br />-Nutrition: 100 Calories! Unfortunately, you know what this means. It's not a big grab by any means. It's about 15-20 chips per .8 oz bag. Which, honestly, is great for portion control. It's probably all we need and popchips knows it. Definitely more filling than other 100 calorie snacks made by, say, SnackWell or the oreos/mini muffins type.<br />-Flavor: The 3 pack comes with Cheddar Potato, Sea Salt and Vinegar, and Barbecue Potato. As an English major I'm inclined to take the ""potato"" off the label. Just as salty and flavorful as normal chips, but not overpowering like some (cheap tortilla chips/some doritos). NATURAL taste.<br />I bought these on sale with a 15-20% discount I believe. I might purchase them again if I won a gift card or something, but I would rather look for these in a store or at a warehouse club and save some cash/trees on the gigantic box they come in. But if you are on the fence and worried about being disappointed, you won't be. This is definitely quality over quantity."
1706,1706,1706,1707,5,"I ordered these chips due to other readers reviews being so good. In addition, my pregnant wife and I enjoy foods that are portioned and easy for taking on the go.

1709,1709,1709,1710,2,"These are to potato chips as Pringles are to chips; as instant coffee is to brewed coffee; and Stephen Baldwin is to Alec Baldwin - same family but scant resemblance.  So I'd buy a single, small package at your grocers and try them out.  Not for everyone, and certainly not for my family which includes two teenage boys.  Even they take a pass on these unless they are truly desperate.  Crispness is OK.  Even mouth feel is good, but there is a lingering (not good) taste - again, kind of like Pringles.  PS: the flavors are OK but definitely taste like they were made at that flavor factory along the Jersey Turnpike."
1710,1710,1710,1711,1,"Purchased the 0.8oz bag (Seemed the same size as the other bags when purchased), but didn't realize it was 0.8 ounces as compared to other bags.  Just be aware - might be perfect for some, but not for us.  Having a bag with 10 potato chips in it doesn't cut it for me.  Might be perfect for kids - but just a heads up."
1711,1711,1711,1712,5,"We tried these chips because DR. OZ had recommended them on his show as a healthier potato chip alternative.  My whole family loves them, we have not found a flavor that we don't like.  These are WAY better than any baked style chip.  Try them and you won't be disappointed!"
1712,1712,1712,1713,5,"These chips are pretty delicious.. Even the original flavor with nothing on it is good. It's not as delicious as Doritos, but it's also not fried either, which definitely balances it out. A good snack for all times of day!"
1713,1713,1713,1714,5,MY kids loved these and they were such a great deal. I didn't feel so guilty about giving my kids chips!!
1714,1714,1714,1715,4,"Like many others, we were on the fence about buying these Popchips, with the possibility of being stuck with 24 bags of chips that even the dogs may not eat.  Turns out though we enjoy them all, the kids like the plain ones, saying they taste like Pringles, and my wife and I are particularly fond of the cracked pepper and salt.  We are not fans of BBQ chips in general, but still ate the BBQ Popchips.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying these again"
1715,1715,1715,1716,5,Everyone should try these chips. They are healthier than regular chips. And they taste good.
1716,1716,1716,1717,5,"This was our first time trying Popchips, but I had heard so many good things about them so I was eager to try them.  We ordered the variety pack to try a few flavors.  My kids gobbled all of them easily but their favorite was the salt and vinegar.  My favorite by far is the BBQ flavor.  We love popchips here!!!"
1717,1717,1717,1718,5,"These are the best alternative chips I have ever tried. I have shared them with friends and relatives and they all agree. You get enough in the single serve packs to be truly satisfied and if you are a weight watchers customer, they are GREAT, only 2 points for each bag!!!"
1718,1718,1718,1719,4,Possibly THE best salt and vinegar chips (healthy or not) ever!  The salt is just right and compliment the vinegar's tartness perfectly.<br /><br />All the chips are good.. salt and pepper can be a little overwhelming.
1719,1719,1719,1720,5,"These are by far one of the most tasty chips available in the market. It's not greasy, doesn't leave a strong after taste as compared to other chips available in the market.  First time time tasting it was during the Natural Product Expo West 2009 in Anaheim, fell in love with it almost right away.<br /><br />The only thing I can complain about this product was probably the price, which is higher compared to chips of other brands.  In addition, the barbeque flavor and the original flavor are slightly salty compare to the rest of the flavor in the variety pack.<br /><br />Amazon's pricce on this item, along with the subscription discount made me pull the trigger almost instantaneously.  if you have a costco nearby, you can also purchase this item at a very discounted price, slightly higher than what Amazon offers though."
1720,1720,1720,1721,5,"This variety pack is perfect for when you want something crunchy and salty.<br />The selection of flavors were great choices for me - I liked them all.<br />The portion keeps you from overeating, and they are healthier for you than<br />potato chips, even the baked ones.<br />I recommend these and will be buying them again and again."
1721,1721,1721,1722,5,The popchips are a nice alternative to potato chips. They are not greasy and only 100 calories per bag. Great for dieters. Fits in with a low calorie diet. Definitely would recommend trying at least once.
1722,1722,1722,1723,5,Totally amazing and very delicious.<br /><br />My favorite flavors (from best to worst):<br /><br />1. barbecue<br />2. sour cream and onion<br />3. cheddar<br /><br />4. salt and pepper<br />5. original<br />6.  vinegar and sea salt
1723,1723,1723,1724,5,Salt and Vinegar and BBQ rock!  Plain were OK....Didn't really care for Cheddar.  Nice to start w/a variety pack to find the ones you prefer.
1724,1724,1724,1725,4,"If you had to choose, my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar, followed by salt and pepper. Suprisingly, the original flavor was my least favorite, probably because I was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer. Very tasty chips, healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor. In fact, the taste is better than most regular chips I've had. Would highly recommend this product! This is a really nice product."
1725,1725,1725,1726,5,"I got these for $10 for the 24 pack, so a pretty good deal. They are about as healthy as the baked chips I usually buy.  They all taste great and Im officially a fan.<br /><br />It's pretty much what it sounds like chips that are popped instead of baked.  So they do have some ""air"" in them.  .8 ounce bags is slightly more than the .75 ounches in baked lays bags I was buying.<br /><br />Good buy if you can get a good deal like I did"
1726,1726,1726,1727,5,"Popchips are a healthy and light alternative to regular potato chips.  They are full of flavor, and only 2 Weight Watcher points per delicious bag!

1728,1728,1728,1729,5,Excellent taste for a low calorie snack.  This size bag is exactly 100 calories and you get a lot of chips.  I prefer these to the regular greasy chips.
1729,1729,1729,1730,5,I expected..idk..maybe tasteless cardboard...but these are really good..i have only tried the bbq so far..but it packs a lot of flavor and you get a lot of chips in a single serving bag!  I will update after my family beach trip because i am taking the 24 pack with us for some moderately healthy snacking..my only caveat is..these could prove to be addictive..i am looking to watch my weight..and these are definitely a temptation!  Very happy with this product:)
1730,1730,1730,1731,3,"I order these chips on a regular basis.  If you are doing Weight Watchers, these chips are 2 points a bag.  When this particular shipment arrived at my house, it was poorly packaged.  I received a case of crumbs instead of a case of chips.  This is the 1st time in the four times that I've ordered these, hopefully it won't happen again."
1731,1731,1731,1732,5,i love popchips and this was really a treat to get the variety of flavors and the individual bags were such convenience! Thank you!
1732,1732,1732,1733,5,"I absolutely love Pop Chips as a healthy alternative to regular, fatty chips.  The Seat Salt and Pepper and the Sour Cream and Onion are my favorites.  I don't crave regular chips at all!"
1733,1733,1733,1734,5,"I LUV me some POPCHIPS!!  These are great snack items.  I ordered a case, and passed them around my office.  Now everyone is addicted to these chips. I have not found anyone that did not like these chips...and they are healthier than the baked chips out there. YUMM!!"
1734,1734,1734,1735,4,"Popchips don't taste like a lot of the other lowfat salty snack options.  They are light in taste and big on crunch.  Great alternative to potato chips.  I'm not a fan of the BBQ flavor but I do like the sea salt & vinegar, salt & pepper alot and sour cream and onion.  Like the individual bags - perfect for on the go and lunches."
1735,1735,1735,1736,5,"When I found these chips I was shocked to see how little fat there is in these. They taste great and the are actually not bad for you either. I told my sister, and she has told her friend everyone loves them after they try them. We order boxes so we can have them at work instead of using the vending machines, the office loves them. They can be a little hard to find, that why I order the online."
1736,1736,1736,1737,5,"This 24-pack lasted about a month, and I sampled all of the flavors but only got to eat the barbecue flavor once, as it is my wife's and my favorite. So, I reordered just the barbecue. Great snack for 100 calories. I've purchased the reduced fat Pringles 100-calorie individual packs before, and you get a lot more chips in a Popchips bag than from Pringles."
1737,1737,1737,1738,5,Great product! All the flavors were delicious. Loved the fact that the single serve bags were about 100 calories each.
1738,1738,1738,1739,5,"I LOVE THESE CHIPS, I HAVE THEM ON AUTO ORDER EVERY 2 MONTHS, THEY TASTE GREAT, I CAN NOT BELIVE THE WHOLE BAG HAS 100 CALORIES, I HAVE A BAG EVERY DAY, IT SURE HAS HELPED MY WEIGHT LOSS BY HAVEING THEM IN LITTLE BAGS, SO I DO NOT EAT A HUGE AMOUNT"
1739,1739,1739,1740,5,I am very impressed with the flavors. ALL OF THEM! There were a few flavors I wasn't sure I was going to like....but they are really good also! The flavors are very intense. You are not getting a bland chip. I'm on the monthly plan but I've already had to order them ahead of schedule twice!
1740,1740,1740,1741,5,PopChips are delicious and much healthier than your regular potato chips. I love all the flavors !! It's also nice to get a variety box with single serving bags.
1741,1741,1741,1742,5,Fabulous - tasty but not awful for you!  I've already recommended to folks I work with.  Will continue to purchase!
1742,1742,1742,1743,5,It is simple. These chips taste great and are a healthier alternative to other brands. Way better than anything baked! I highly recommend them!
1743,1743,1743,1744,5,The Popchips were excellent - had excellent flavor and low in calories.  When you eat these - don't need another potato chip!
1744,1744,1744,1745,5,"These chips are delicious and low in calories.  I love the salt and vinegar, and the barbeque.  We buy them by the case.  They are great.  Thanks for offering them."
1745,1745,1745,1746,5,"I love pop chips and the variety pack was fantastic.  Delivered quickly - these chips are filling, full of flavor and way healthier than other types of chips."
1746,1746,1746,1747,5,"I first tried them after a product get together at Jelly Belly in Fairfield, Ca. I was so pleased, that I wanted more!  Well my Husband said he saw some at Costco so he got a few flavors and boy was I hooked. I sent my Grandsons in Idaho a box of 24 mixed small packages and also a friend in Ohio the same thing.  I am on a calorie counting diet along with my Husband and we eat the popchips almost every day. I like the different flavors and the fact they are healthy for you...alot better then baked or fried.  I am sold and really enjoy them...you came up with a fantastic product.  Sincerely, Viki Crabtree"
1747,1747,1747,1748,4,"Pop-Chips are VERY GOOD!  I'm on a mission to lose weight and these have replaced high calorie snacks.  I think I even like these better than regular chips!  The BBQ, Salt & Vinegar, and Cheddar are really good alone (and I'm not normally a BBQ chip person).  I tend to eat the Original, Sour Cream & Onion , and the Salt & Pepper with Laughing Cow Cheese as a dip.  I don't really care for the salt & pepper as much as the others because I don't really like pepper in general and these are very peppery.  I wish they would replace the salt & pepper with the parmesan garlic flavor.<br /><br />Also, I like to buy these small packages to limit my portion size, but also because there are a lot of chips in this one little bag.  It also makes it really convenient for me to grab a few bags and take them to work or throw a few in the car.  I don't have kids but the small bags would be nice for kids as well."
1748,1748,1748,1749,5,"My son and daughter-in-law told me about these chips and they purchased a few bags at a store and I will say they are higher in stores then you can get them online on Amazon. They brought me a bag and I was hooked! So I ordered popchips online and they are the ""BEST"" chips!! There wasn't a flavor I didn't like or that my family didn't like. I am a (chipaholic) and these are better for you and a great tasting chip. I highly recommend these to anyone that can't do without eating chips either with a sandwich, hamburger, or just to munch on midday.<br />You won't be dissapointed."
1749,1749,1749,1750,5,The pop-chips are great. I had heard they were really good and I totally agree. I love being able to have all the flavors. I like the variety.<br />The chips were delivered quickly and safely.
1750,1750,1750,1751,5,I love popchips and especially when they are in individual portion sizes and a variety of flavors...good for you and tastes great and are easy to put in lunches or snacks on the go!
1751,1751,1751,1752,5,"If I had to describe a Popchip, I would say that it's a hybrid of a  potato chip and a popcorn cake.  I was a little skeptical, at first, since I was trying to figure out how they were made if they weren't baked or fried, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried them.  This variety pack gives people a good opportunity to try the six different flavors and decide which ones are their favorite(s).  If you're a snacker or if you are looking for a healthier alternative to fried potato chips, this are a must-try."
1752,1752,1752,1753,5,"I liked most all of these except for the cheddar ones.  These are packed with flavor and are a great alternative to regular potato chips as well as being just 80% just as good.<br /><br />The best way to describe these is that they are like rice cakes except make from potatoes.  I hate rice hates but loved these (just the texture is compared to rice cakes not the flavor)and I will definitely purchase them again in the future.<br /><br />I recommend giving these a chance, they are a great healthy and quick snack."
1753,1753,1753,1754,5,"For 100 calories a bag, these are the closest thing you will get to regular potato chips, they have great crunch and flavor."
1754,1754,1754,1755,5,"These are crunchy and very tasty!  These don't taste like the 'usual' chips from the store.  When I first tried them, I could tell right away they were different from the greasy, salty, fatty chips I was used to eating.  These have their own flavor and crunch and I started to appreciate them right away.  I noticed I didn't feel so sluggish and icky after eating these.  Which was wonderful.  The combo package is great because the flavors are all very different and tasty.  And I love the smaller packages.  They really hit the spot without the risk of overindulging."
1755,1755,1755,1756,5,"the pop chips are really incredible. They are very flavorful and crispy. My Favorite is the BBQ, but that is just me, they are all good. I would highly recommend these to anyone who is watching their weight of just for overall better health."
1756,1756,1756,1757,5,"these chips tatse great, and the serving size is good. we especially liked the variety pack with six flavors"
1757,1757,1757,1758,5,"I recently received the variety packs of popchips. i have them delivered to work and everyone just loves them.<br /><br />i tried one flavor ...delicious, next flavor.... excellent, next flavor... oh my goodness, even better and it gets better and better.<br /><br />Best snack in recent memory.  :)"
1758,1758,1758,1759,5,"Very tasty chips, healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor. In fact, the taste is better than most regular chips I've had. Would highly recommend this product! If you had to choose, my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar, followed by salt and pepper. Ironically, the original flavor was my least favorite, probably because I was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer."
1759,1759,1759,1760,5,"These chips might seem a little expensive compared to other leading (and unhealthy I might add)chips, but I was not disappointed in my purchase. They arrived in a few days and made the perfect snack for me and my husband's lunches. Also, we checked for the closest store selling these and it was Target 50 miles away in Tulsa and would have been costly to buy them as they are more per case and the drive to get them."
1760,1760,1760,1761,5,"The reason why I ordered this on-line is because the only Pop Chips they have in my store are the regular and salt and vinegar & barbeque.  I LOVE the sour cream and onion ones - actually I love ALL of them, but it's great to have them in the 100 calorie bag, because if they weren't I wouldn't be able to stop eating them."
1761,1761,1761,1762,5,I love these chips...and my husband does too. He wipes them out before I can get to them. The variety pack is a great way to determine which flavor you like. They are packaged well and always fresh. The bag contains a generous portion. I've purchased many times and am never dissapointed.
1762,1762,1762,1763,5,"This is a great chip replacement! Wow all the flavors are terrific,good with a sandwich, soup, or just a late night snack!"
1763,1763,1763,1764,5,Pop Chips are the best chips I've had in a long time.  I'm a Weight Watcher and to satisfy that salty craving I get now and then these chips are the ticket and they are only 2 points.  And when I buy a case of them they average I think about .94.  Not bad.
1764,1764,1764,1765,5,"loved the assortment pack. everyone in family loves them.  low fat, lower calorie and all natural, simple snack for kid's lunch bags. It is peanut and tree nut free (safe for allergy kids) and although it is made on equipment shared with wheat, I bought this for my child who is on an wheat limiting diet."
1765,1765,1765,1766,5,"I am a chip addict and these are by far some of the tastiest, non-homemade chips I've ever had. Plus they're healthy! Only problem is I can't decide which flavor is my favorite."
1766,1766,1766,1767,5,"I love these chips. They are excellent! On the Weight Watchers plan they are only 2 points per bag which is GREAT for potatoe chips. LOVE the single serving bags for portion control. Also love Amazon.com for selling them. Can't find them in the stores. I will be ordering these forever. Great product.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVFDOO"">Popchips 6-Flavor Variety Pack of 24 [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]"
1767,1767,1767,1768,5,"I love these chips and they are a perfect low fat snack to keep me held over through my day.  The only thing bad about the Amazon price is they are about $20 for a 24 pack.  That is 80 cents each.  Sadly I discovered this great snack at work in the vending machine - for 75 cents.  I would expect to buy them for .50 a pack if I have to buy 24 and not from a vending machine.  I highly recommend these chips, but there is no savings buying the from Amazon."
1768,1768,1768,1769,5,Variety pack of popchips r sooo good all flavors r delicious and r way healthier than regular greasy potato chips....popchips r half the fat and only 100 calories so a def must buy
1769,1769,1769,1770,5,I am in love with POP Chips! They are my go to low calorie snack! The largest 100 calorie pack out there!
1770,1770,1770,1771,5,These chips are very good. Wish we could purchase them in our area. Great chance to try them in this offer.
1771,1771,1771,1772,5,"These are better than any low calorie chips I've ever had, and I prefer them to normal chips. They are wonderful. Oprah even loves them.  I would buy this box again, and probably will, because I LOVE that these are 100 calorie packs. The barbeque and salt and vinegar ones are AWESOME."
1772,1772,1772,1773,4,They were not bad tasting...........they served the purpose that I wantned with a sandwich nice and crunchy
1773,1773,1773,1774,5,These chips are delicious and each bag only has 100 calories.  They are not fried but just baked and come in 6 different flavors.  For anyone who is dieting but loves potato chips these are great.
1774,1774,1774,1775,5,These are the best chips ever and what a great swap for all the fat and calories of regular chips.  Not to mention that they come in single servings so when you eat the WHOLE bag it's ok!!!  Great product and I would highly recommend it anyone.
1775,1775,1775,1776,5,I originally found these at a Target out of my home town. I fell in love with them as part of my Weight Watcher's plan. They are a good snack alternative when I crave something salty. I could not find them where I live so I purchased them from the Pop Chips web site which took me through Amazon. Yummy!
1776,1776,1776,1777,5,"This is one of the best new products I have ever tried in a long time.....These are delicious chips, they taste like chips, ( not styrofoam) and are all natural !<br />The Barbeque are outstanding, as are the plain, sour creme and onion, salt and pepper. I don't love the Cheddar or the Salt and vinegar, they are a bit strong.<br /><br />If you are on weight watchers each bag is 2 points, and are a great find to cover the crunchy/salty crave, If you are not on weight watchers, you will still enjoy them. My husband loves them, my co-workers love them, kids love them. They can not believe their Mom is allowing them to eat a bag of chips a day!<br /><br />Overall an excellent product !"
1777,1777,1777,1778,5,These taste wonderful!  Guilt free if you can stop at one bag.  Will definitly buy again!
1778,1778,1778,1779,5,"Love, love, love these crunchy little treats.  They remind me of ""Munchos"" but without the greasy tounge afterwards.  I don't usually like flavored snacks, but these are all great, not overwhelming and no gross aftertaste.  I subscribe to them so I will never run out:)"
1779,1779,1779,1780,5,What's to say - Pop Chips are great!!!  Kudos to the PoP Chip makers.
1780,1780,1780,1781,5,"I really liked these chips.<br /><br />They came recommended from my friend and I really like them. The variety pack is great to try all of the flavors - although there were some I wasn't so fond of.<br /><br />The cheddar, bbq, and salt/pepper chips are great. The traditional ones are get this.... traditional. No excitement there.<br /><br />The chips are great - my brother still asks if I have any around the house but I haven't yet purchased them again.<br /><br />Hint: the have the texture of the snack Munchos."
1781,1781,1781,1782,5,I love these chips so much... and I can't get over how delicious each variety is!! The price here is AWESOME too!
1782,1782,1782,1783,5,"I picked up a few bags of these at my local HEB and couldnt help but consume half of a bag in a day. The entire stock didnt last even a week for me.<br /><br />Many chips say they have a bold flavor but they never deliver. These, however, do. I tried the Garlic Parmessan chips and the first things I thought was how strong and delicious the parmessan was.. shortly followed by a garlic flavor. Combined with a sharp crunch, I cannot have enough of these chips. I'm almost afraid to buy a 24 pack because I know they won't last a month.<br /><br />It also helps that these things are pretty healthy for you. I mean, they are a potato crisp so you can't be entirely guilt-free... but I don't knock myself for going to town. I just avoid the potato chip aisle these are on when I need to lay low on the snack foods ;)"
1783,1783,1783,1784,5,These chips are incredible! Enough can't be said about them. They are better than potato chips and without the guilt of fat and calories!
1784,1784,1784,1785,5,I love these chips! They always make a great healthy snack when I'm stuck at work with just the vending machine for sustenance.
1785,1785,1785,1786,5,"Love these pop-chips! The variety bag was a great deal, especially with the $5 off.  Tasty, low fat- just what I needed as a healthy alternative for a great price. I highly recommend these!"
1786,1786,1786,1787,5,"I love Popchips!! They taste great and they do not have all of the fat that regular chips contain.  I was introduced to the wonderful world of Popchips several months ago and I have not looked at regular chips the same.  I do not consume copious amounts of potato chips, however, I do occasionally pack my kids lunch with the salty tubers. My family enjoys the Popchips so much, that I purchased a variety pack of 24 (0.8oz bags) from Amazon.  They taste very good and the texture is wonderful, although I will admit they are a bit salty.  I really enjoy the salt and pepper flavor the best, with the salt and vinegar coming in a close second.  Make sure you have a large glass of water as you are consuming these popped treats, because as I stated before they are quite salty. I highly recommend these for individuals who eat potato chips and want a somewhat more healthy alternative."
1787,1787,1787,1788,5,Love All THE FLAVORS!!!!! JUST THE RIGHT SIZE PACKAGE AND TASTE GREAT!!!!! GIVE THEM A TRY YOU WILL LOVE THEM ALSO!!!!!
1788,1788,1788,1789,5,"I discovered Pop Chips a year or so ago, and my whole family LOVES them!  We are partial to crunchy, salty snacks (like potato chips) but hardly ever get them because of the calorie overload.  These are a perfect substitute!  Great to tide you over between meals, or with a sandwich, or a movie-watching snack.  The small size bags are perfect for NOT getting too carried away, too!"
1789,1789,1789,1790,4,"I love popchips, The bag now has only 100 calories. and it bit smaller but If you are craving pop chips without the fat and still taste great. These are for you. A bit pricey but worth it."
1790,1790,1790,1791,5,"I heard of these through my weight watchers magazine. They a had a $5 coupon code so I figured ""what the heck!"". WOW -- pop chips are amazing - every flavor is AWESOME! I particularly liked the salt & pepper. If you want crunch and flavor - these are for you!!"
1791,1791,1791,1792,1,"I don't know why everyone loves these chips. They are healthy but taste disgusting. Only the original flavor tasted good, so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea. I would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these. Pirate's Booty makes popped chips that are way better."
1792,1792,1792,1793,3,"I am interested in these but was wondering if someone that has them could post some nutrition info on them? Mainly, fat, fiber, sugars, and then any vitamins? Thanks so much!!"
1793,1793,1793,1794,5,"I shared these with my two older sons, then ordered more. These are great to put in the glove compartment for after work."
1794,1794,1794,1795,3,"I decided to try these based on the reviews - they are pretty good - especially for a more healthy option, but not sure I'll get them again."
1795,1795,1795,1796,2,"Despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks, I see no reason to buy them again. Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews. They contain a lot of ""Wow!"" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.<br /><br />The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...<br /><br />Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.<br /><br />The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.<br /><br />And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. You won't have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.<br /><br />But... bottom line... expensive junk ""health food"". ""Wow!""."
1796,1796,1796,1797,1,Two words: potato flakes. Not sure what the buzz about these is. Try one bag before you buy a case. Can't be returned.
1797,1797,1797,1798,5,in my book. You can eat one serving with ease and not feel any remorse. Just wish That there were more BBQ and Cheese flavored selections. The Black pepper is the BESTEST yet.
1798,1798,1798,1799,2,OK...but would never buy them again my husband ate some...<br /><br /> I thought they tasted a lot like the chips they used to call MUNCHO'S!<br /><br /> Just not for me!
1799,1799,1799,1800,2,"I've heard about these chips for a while now and thought they would be a good alternative to regular chips. I couldn't eat them though, they just don't taste good to me personally. My grandmother loved them though and I gave the rest to her."
1800,1800,1800,1801,5,they taste awesome! esp the salt n pepper one! I love them and they are really healthy! the packaging is really good..
1801,1801,1801,1802,5,"These popchips are a great alternative when you need a munchie, crunchie snack. They are much lower in calories/fat than regular chips and are portioned controlled. I especially like the barbeque flavor or the salt and pepper flavored popchips."
1802,1802,1802,1803,5,"We love Popchips, but they're hard to find at our local grocery stores. I was very excited to find this variety pack, which has 6 flavors (some of which we'd never tried before) in single-serve packages right around 100 calories a piece. Our favorites were the original, sea salt & vinegar, and sour cream & onion... but all of the flavors were good. These were perfect for snacks, but they also made for easy lunches. We'll definitely order again!"
1803,1803,1803,1804,5,"Popchips are an excellent snack. I really like all of the varieties. I use Amazon's subscription plan and save some $$  -  I get 1 24-pack box per month, shipped automatically. Life is grand!"
1804,1804,1804,1805,5,"Popchips are phenomenal!  Unfortunately, just not readily available at a retailer near you.  Ordering online is the next best, especially with Amazon Prime service! My dad loved his boxes of Popchips.  I'm happy, as his daughter, to find a healthier snack that he can enjoy and receive right at his doorstep."
1805,1805,1805,1806,5,"I am enjoying the recent purchase of PopChips, so far I have enjoyed all the flavor choices.  The individual serving bags make it easy for me to have just the right portion serving with my meals or if I have a craving for a snack.  Thanks for the product. Jean Roth"
1806,1806,1806,1807,5,"I'm really glad Amazon carries these, they are so much better for you than regular chips and actually taste good too.  We haven't found a flavor we didn't like yet.  I'll probably use the Amazon subscribe feature to get another $3 off as we will go through these fairly regularly.  Awesome chips!"
1807,1807,1807,1808,5,these are the best chips I have every tasted They are Healthy for4 you & have Great flavor  I will buy often I eat 1 bag a day with my Lunch  Yummy !!!
1808,1808,1808,1809,4,This chips are perfect for a snack without having greasy fingers leftover.  All the flavors are great with my favorite being the vinegar and sea salt.
1809,1809,1809,1810,5,Great Chips - No after taste...<br />Seem to be much better for me.<br />Need to buy the big bags now.
1810,1810,1810,1811,2,"I decided to give these a try since one of my good friends and her son raved about how good they were...Bad idea!  I almost ordered two since they were such a good price, I am so glad I didn't!  We don't care of these AT ALL!  The concept is nice, chips that are crunchy and better for you than most, BUT they taste funny!  They have a funny aftertaste and are not that enjoyable.  We have been slowly (and I mean very slowly) making our way through the 24 the box brought (we still have 19 left and we received them over two weeks ago) so they are not so horrible that you can't eat them, its just like forcing us to eat them so we don't have to throw them all away!  If you haven't had them before, I suggest trying them before committing to 24 bags of various yucky flavors!"
1811,1811,1811,1812,3,"Not anything to rave about. They were okay. I think if I truly had a craving for chips I would just buy and eat ""regular"" ones. Won't buy again."
1812,1812,1812,1813,5,"Amazing concept... not fried, not even baked... Popped like Popcorn... !!!!<br />This is another product for my Weight Watchers regima. Each bag is only 2 points.. I love this snack for mid morning in between breakfast and lunch. They taste really good.. my favorite are the Bar-b-que, Salt & Vinegar, and the Sour Cream.. they are all good though."
1813,1813,1813,1814,3,"Although they are mildly healthier, they don't taste as good as Baked Lays.<br /><br />Also, having a huge box of chips around isn't necessarily healthy because I ended up eating them more often.<br /><br />They are worth a try, but they just seem a bit overpriced (even with subscription savings) and over-hyped."
1814,1814,1814,1815,3,"They're okay, but not the most amazing thing ever.<br /><br />~ The Good ~<br />Good flavor, no too strong or weak.<br />Crunchy, but not too dry.<br />Plenty of chips in each bag. Not just filled with air.<br />Not greasy, so makes a good on-the-go snack.<br />All natural, using no artificial flavors or colors.<br /><br />~ The Bad ~<br />Sill plenty of fat per bag (3.5 grams per bag of the sour cream flavor) so don't get them expecting them to be low fat.<br />Tastes like a low-fat chip, but with all the fat of regular chips.<br /><br />~ Conclusion ~<br />I'm 50/50 on if I'll order them again. I have a finicky stomach, and so I'm fine with things that taste low-fat and healthy, since those are mostly what I eat. But these have all the fat and calories of chips that are fried and even more than those that are baked, so I'm undecided on if I want more chips that have a healthy taste with all the fat. The all natural ingredients are what make this chip different, and what might bring me back for more. It's definitely one of those snacks you have to try for yourself, and see if you like them or not."
1815,1815,1815,1816,2,"I love shrimp chips and I love healthier alternatives as well so I thought these would be a match made in heaven. Not so much. The flavors were too strong most of the time (I am a huge fan of pepper but even I had a hard time enjoying the salt & pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is -- and this is from someone who currently lives in the UK and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here) and too bleh in others. The only flavors that my husband and I both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didn't enjoy them enough to want to buy these again.<br /><br />I wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have 15 bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say, I will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on."
1816,1816,1816,1817,3,I expected from the extremely positive reviews on the site for full flavor healty chips. In reality I get an OKAY taste with a strange aftertaste on basically all of the flavors. Chedder and Salt&Pepper honestly being some of the worst tasting chips I've ever had. If you're just looking for a great tasting brand of chips with health as a #2 on the list there are much much better brands out there. In the end I compare these chips to diet soda vs regular; Some won't tell the difference while some will immediately sense it and hate it.
1817,1817,1817,1818,5,"I ordered these chips because they got so many good reviews and I'm so glad I did.<br />All of the flavors are tasty and satisfying. At 100 calories a bag, they are a great snack. They quell that hunger for crunchy, salty, goodness without killing my diet. Yes, they are a bit pricier than a big bag of regular chips, but it stops me from eating just a couple more and 1 bag is really enough to keep me happy. I've got a new favorite chip."
1818,1818,1818,1819,5,"If you are trying to eat healthy (like me), but love junk food (like me), these are the chips for you.  I have given up potato chips and french fries in my quest to eat guilt free, but a sandwich just needs something on the side. These chips add a great crunch as a side to a sandwich, and are a great snack for only 100 calories. They have no preservatives, no artificial flavors or colors, no cholesterol, 0 grams saturated fat, o grams trans fat, and are gluten free. Ingredients are potato flakes, potato starch, safflower oil and/or sunflower oil, rice flour, sea salt. They would be great to pack in a school lunch or for an after school snack. I ordered them on the subscription plan, a case a month, but might have to add an extra shipment. Everyone I have given a pack to loved them too and came back for more."
1819,1819,1819,1820,3,Popchips are good and great for diet snack. But on Amazon the price is nearly double the cost of Costco. An 18 pack is only $7.89 at Costco.
1820,1820,1820,1821,3,"So for a ""healthier"" snack it sure is salty. But then the salt is a way for them to make the chips taste better without additional calories. Each bag is 100 calories with 10% sodium intake for the day.<br /><br />The chips are not bad, i just wouldn't get them again because most of the flavoring comes from the salt."
1821,1821,1821,1822,3,"I really wanted to like these. All the reviews made it seem supernal, and, well as advertised, it's not fried nor baked.<br /><br />However, even though it is advertised as being ""healthy"" but still with plenty of flavor, that flavor just means each chip is loaded with salt. I only looked at the nutrition facts after I felt they were too salty, and I discover that a 100cal bag contains 10% dv of sodium.<br /><br />I'm not a health nut, nor am I trying to diet. These were my first food purchase from amazon, and I bought them because they were at the top of the search list and seemed to be a best seller. However, I just couldn't get into these chips.<br /><br />I realize that the flavour of the chips is up to each individuals' tastebuds, and so I will say that these are perfect for those who enjoy chips with strong flavor. I personally enjoy chips where I can taste some potato as well."
1822,1822,1822,1823,5,I HAPPENED UPON THIS ITEM IN MY LOCAL DELI AND BEING CURIOS I DECIDED TO TRY.  THEY WERE FABULOUS BETTER THAN THE REGULAR CHIPS BY FAR.  I GIVES YOU SATISFACTION OF CRUNCH AND FLAVOR IN A POTATOE CHIP.  GREAT GREAT FIND.
1823,1823,1823,1824,4,"I first got the variety pack to try all the different flavors, then I picked 2 and ordered them on Subscribe and Save (1 each on alternate months).  It's much cheaper than the vending machine at work and they only have chips that are bad for you.  These chips are crisp, delicious, and taste salty, mmmmmmm good! Each bag has 230 mg. of sodium. They only have 100 calories in a bag, and the amount of chips in the bag is ample for one serving, unlike other 100 calorie snacks where you get 7 almonds, or 5 crackers....  Now I can have chips every day at work for lunch, no guilt!  The Salt and Pepper variety is absolutely delicious.  The plain is great for dipping, and the barbecue is full of flavor.  The salt and vinegar is very sour, if you like that type, and the cheddar and sour cream and onion varieties are good, just not my favorites.  A very good deal on Subscribe and Save, chips delivered to your door, individually bagged and ready to take for lunch.  Convenient!  Nothing bad to say about PopChips!"
1824,1824,1824,1825,5,The chips are good with fast service but I ordered a case(24) of Popchips 6-flavor Variety Pack and received 24 bags all Barbecue flavored.
1825,1825,1825,1826,2,"I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I've been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.<br /><br />I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.<br /><br />I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.<br /><br />****SUMMARY****<br /><br />How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)<br /><br />Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.<br /><br />Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.<br /><br />If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:<br /><br />**POP CHIPS:**<br />Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%),<br />Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g<br /><br />**BAKED LAYS:**<br />Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%<br /><br />So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.<br /><br />I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.<br /><br />At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.<br /><br />(Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20): <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TVDHIO"">Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)</a> )"
1826,1826,1826,1827,3,"I have not ordered yet, my question is, from the description, it is 24 bags at 0.8 ounces. How does this equal 192 ounces in total weight?"
1827,1827,1827,1828,3,"I first tried the BBQ flavor at a restaurant, which was good. Then, I was carried away with the 1/2 fat part, which made me pay without realizing my mistake!<br /><br />The ""Salt & Pepper"" is OK! ONLY OK, after trying another one, I changed my mind!<br /><br />The ""BBQ"" is good, but not that good!<br /><br />The rest is pure trash! I did not like them, what-so-ever nor my other 4 friends!<br /><br />The price is wayyyyyy high, and not worth it for a small single serving, as others such as Utz is WAYYYY better and cheaper!<br /><br />3 starts is too much for this over-marketed, less of flavor, and over-priced snack!<br /><br />AVOID!<br /><br />2 stars off: bad flavors<br /><br />1 star off: PRICY AS SH**!, and not worth it!"
1828,1828,1828,1829,5,"I've tried using a toaster/microwave/confection oven/stove to make these things myself, but I wasn't able to. I even tried barbecuing but was unable to get the chips to ""pop"". I verified my methods with a local grocery store clerk named Mat (his name has one ""T"", which seemed a little strange to me), but to no avail.<br /><br />I contacted customer support asking for instructions but they acted aloof and confused about their own product! I don't know why they couldn't just mail, or at least email me some popping instructions.<br /><br />Luckily I think even raw/unpopped they taste pretty good. People look at them funny at first, but after they try a few they basically devour the whole bag, completely unpopped..."
1829,1829,1829,1830,3,"The flavors are kind of funky salt and pepper? Tastes like someone just pored a jar of black pepper over the chips and the salt and vinegar, thee two varieties just make one go yummm EWWWWWW tossed out those verities but the others were very good. Less chip and more like a cracker with a chip flavor. Still a good item but I wouldn't suggest the variety pack unless you living dangerous and have lots of water to gag them down with."
1830,1830,1830,1831,4,"The 'Sun Chips' are an OK substitute for the usual potato, corn, whatever chip cooked in oil and over salted.  They are not nearly as un-palatable as I thought they would be.  Have added them to my 'heart healthy' diet regime.  All are good except for the 'multi-grain' style, which has the texture of a sheet of plywood."
1831,1831,1831,1832,1,I bought those chips after reading good reviews but I was very disappointed with the taste. It was nothing like what I expected (granted that I expected good old kettle cooked potato chips). I bought the 6-flavor variety pack and there were many flavors I did not care for. It was worth trying them but I am not going to purchase them again in the future.
1832,1832,1832,1833,1,"Pop Chips are basically a horribly over-priced version of ""Munchos"" which are baked potato chips and have been around forever. Period."
1833,1833,1833,1834,1,"I bought these chips thinking that they are ""all natural"" per their description of ""No preservatives, no artificial flavors or colors.""  When I received them I checked the ingredients, and they contain ""yeast extract,"" which is synonymous with MSG (yeast extract contains processed free glutamic acid).  I will never purchase this product again."
1834,1834,1834,1835,2,the best flavor in this box is the salt and pepper and the bbq flavor.  all the other flavor was just so-so
1835,1835,1835,1836,1,"I was at a charity fund raising event where they were handing these out. They seemed pretty tasty, so I bought a couple bags at Target. The ones I bought (Barbeque and Salt and Vinegar) were AWFUL! I ended up throwing away most of them, neither I nor anyone else who tried them could choke them down. The ones they were handing out as samples were clearly very different from what they are selling. Don't waste your money."
1836,1836,1836,1837,1,"These chips taste average and they are insanely expensive compare to the big bags of chips from safeway or costco, for $2, you can get a big bag with 10 times the amount of chips compare to these 0.8oz bag chips, so for $5 in safeway, you can get $30 worth of popchips, these bags are so tiny, it's like serve size for fat people trying to lose weigh or something, for me, i never gain weigh, i rather go buy big bag of chips, these are expensive ripoff chips, will never buy again.<br />Maybe i think the price is high because i bought it from amazon.com, maybe elsewhere is cheaper, but chips as junk food, shouldn't be that expensive compare to local stores."
1837,1837,1837,1838,3,"I'm not as crazed about these as everyone else, but for a low-calorie snack, they're fine.  They certainly don't do much to curb the appetite though. I'm typically just as hungry after finishing as before - not like with Protein Chips (also available through Amazon)."
1838,1838,1838,1839,3,"The texture is like rice crackers, which I personally don't like. Taste isn't too bad, but every single bags are too salty, even the original flavor. I'd give four stars if they make low sodium chips. The salt.. is one of your worst enemies. I bet it does more harms to your body than MSG's."
1839,1839,1839,1840,2,"These chips are too salty!!!<br />I like the crunch, size of the bags, and variety.<br />But i cannot finish the case due to how salty these chips are."
1840,1840,1840,1841,4,"The cheddar tastes a little weird, but that could be personal preference. The salt and vinegar is very strong, but tastes okay other than that.  Salt and pepper is yum!  Barbeque is good too.  Plain is plain.  If you're a die hard potato chip lover and don't care about calories, don't bother with these.  However, if you want your salty snacks and don't want all the calories, these work.  I'd buy them again."
1841,1841,1841,1842,5,"I have been on weight watcher's for about 13 months.  I have lost 60 pounds.  The most important part to being on weight watchers is too find food items that let you feel like your not giving anything up.  Popchips do that for me.  They are only 2 points plus on weight watcher's.  They go great with every meal (salad,soup,sandwich,etc). I can not live without them.  So i say BUY BUY BUY AND BUY"
1842,1842,1842,1843,4,Love these!  I'm not a fan of potato chips but these taste fresh and not at all greasy.  A little like Pringles but much tastier.
1843,1843,1843,1844,5,"I am so happy to have discovered these chips. I hate stealing a phrase from another product, but they melt in your mouth. I have ordered and tried all flavors without disappointment.Just getting ready to place another order for these 100 calorie per bag, air popped chips. Do try them people!"
1844,1844,1844,1845,3,"This seemed like the perfect way to limit my addiction to potato chips. Small, single serving bags.  I really like the plain, unflavored Popchips, but the rest of the flavors had an aftertaste.  I plan to set up Subscribe & Save for just the plain."
1845,1845,1845,1846,5,"Love the chips, nice 100 +/- calorie snack, reminds me of Munchos, but less greasy, flavors are good (salt & vinegar least favorite). And they've started shipping APO--thank you and my family thanks you (so they don't have to get the package and reship!) Made my day."
1846,1846,1846,1847,4,"I won't get into all of the specifics of these chips as they are listed here on Amazon. However, I will talk about the product overall. It is very well packaged, the PopChips bags aren't flimsy or too loud. You don't have to worry much about these getting smashed while they're in a bag with heavier items. They hold their own. When trying new foods, snacks, flavors, I tend to purchase a variety pack so that I can sample everything. Let me tell you, these chips are packed with flavor but, it's not, in my opinion, too heavy or saturated. My favorites are the Barbecue Potato and Cheddar Potato by far. Very realistic, savory flavors. Then, there a couple that are not my favorite but, tasty with time. The Sea Salt and Pepper Potato and the Sea Salt and Vinegar Potato are a bit strong at first and, if you don't like those flavors, I would say you wouldn't like those chips but, they certainly accomplish the taste of those ingredients. Original Potato and Sour Cream and Onion Potato are also tasty but, nothing to necessarily rave about, for me at least. I would not call this a ""diet"" chip but, a healthy alternative to over processed chips. I saw a few complaints about the PopChips being ""too salty"" or ""high in sodium"". The chips can come across salty to a person who doesn't consume much salt but, per bag, these PopChips contain about as much sodium as a cup of plain yogurt. Overall, great buy. You just have to decide if the price tag is okay for you, and for me, it is."
1847,1847,1847,1848,5,"Wow, these are remarkably tasty chips.  I discovered them through Weight Watchers and like the fact that they are low in calories and fat.<br />But they are high in flavor and umami.<br />I am now a big fan!"
1848,1848,1848,1849,5,"These are great because they're only 100 calories per pack and are just as good, if not better, than other chips out there.<br /><br />The ""Original"" style taste exactly like Munchos, but don't come with the high calorie count.  The other flavors (Sour Cream & Onion, Salt & Vinegar, Salt & Pepper, Cheddar, and BBQ) are all delicious, as well."
1849,1849,1849,1850,4,"We liked these.  Quite good, even if they're 'healthy' @ 100 calories & 3 whole fat grams a bag. My favorites are the plain, the others are very strong flavored, very zippy!"
1850,1850,1850,1851,5,"I had seen these advertised on the Hungry Girl website but was not big on buying an expensive potato chip.  I was given a free bag at some event & found them to be tasty.  The single serve bags in the grocery store were $1 for a 0.8 oz bag.  Buy them from here and they are $21 for 24 1 oz bags. (Same amount of Weight Watchers points.) If you get two cases, shipping is free! Get them now before the states force the sales tax thing through!<br /><br />All of the flavors are really good.  I even liked the BBQ which I normally do not like in a chip. The cheddar have a good cheese taste and the salt'n'pepper have a kick. They do not leave a funny aftertaste or strange mouth coating like some of the other lower fat/calorie chips."
1851,1851,1851,1852,5,"Love these chips.  They are perfectly seasoned and of course have no grease at all.  There is also not the cardboard taste of a baked chipped.  The popped texture of the potatoes is nice and light. They are only 100 calories a bag, but there are lots of chips in the bag so it's a great snack.  The ingredient list is also pretty wholesome without any strange chemicals added.  Fav flavor is probably salt and pepper or bbq."
1852,1852,1852,1853,5,"I love chips and can easily go through an entire bag in one sitting. With Popchips single serve pouches, I can now feel good about snacking as each bag is only 100 calories. The single serve pouches also help in portion control. The larger bags are a slightly better value, but unless you have astounding self control, I would recommend the single serving option. They are that good! They easily stand up to any of the traditional fried chips I've ever had, and at half the fat and calories, how could you ask for anything more?<br /><br />The variety pack comes in 6 flavors: Original, Sour Cream and Onion, Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, Salt and Vinegar, and BBQ. My favorite flavors are Salt and Pepper and Cheddar. My least favorite is Salt and Vinegar, but I don't like ANY salt and vinegar flavored chip. My only wish is that this variety pack contained the Parmesan Garlic flavor which is VERY good, but extremely hard to find in local stores. I have ordered the Parmesan Garlic flavor in a 24 pack here on Amazon, but prefer the assortment that comes in the variety pack.<br /><br />At ~$17 after the subscribe and save discount, each bag costs only 70 cents. This is a bargain for these great tasting, healthy chips and I highly recommend you try them!"
1853,1853,1853,1854,5,"I was a little hesitant to try these, especially after reading such mixed reviews although overall they were positive. However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.<br /><br />Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.<br /><br />I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone<br />BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is ""sweet"" BBQ. Everyone else loved them.<br />Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ<br />Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags)<br />Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more<br />Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter.<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag<br /><br />I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.  I think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account."
1854,1854,1854,1855,5,"These are the greatest potato snack products I've found.  Only 2 points for Weight Watchers.  Really crispy and tasty.  All of the flavors are great.  My only complaint......it's difficult to open the little bags.  I need a pair of scissors, but I guess that keeps them fresher for longer so it's a great trade off.  I would recommend these chips to everyone."
1855,1855,1855,1856,4,"I really like these chips.  They have a different texture than regular potato chips but I still find it really tasty.  Even my boyfriend, who is often averse to all things ""healthy"" and ""low fat"" will gobble these up rather quickly.  The variety packs are great because they allow you to have a little bit of everything, but of course the downside is that you may not like some flavors as much.  I find the original version to be a little bland by itself, and the sea salt and vinegar flavor might be too strong for some people."
1856,1856,1856,1857,5,"I am potato chip-addicted. I don't only enjoy potato chips, but I also enjoy any type of potato product. This product really hit the mark for me.<br /><br />I consider these a full-fledged snack. Each bag is packed with chips. They are moderately seasoned, and full of flavor. The consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake -- but they're crisp and crunchy, not puffy. They have a distinct potato taste.<br /><br />The best part? Each bag clocks in at only 100 calories! And I repeat -- these are not a simple ""100 calorie"" snack. What you get here is a full bag of chips. What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.<br /><br />My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair. But the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and I did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next.<br /><br />These are a great product, well manufactured, and a treat to eat. I'll definitely buy more of these in the future."
1857,1857,1857,1858,5,"Wow, these chips are delicious!<br /><br />They're low in calorie and carb count. I can actually have a salty snack without feeling guilty about it and the taste is better then unhealthy oil-smothered grocery store chips.<br /><br />The sour cream & onion, salt & vinegar, and cheddar are my favorites!<br /><br />If you're weight conscience, want something healthy, or just want something that tastes good, buy these chips! You won't be disappointed!"
1858,1858,1858,1859,5,"This doesn't taste as addicting as the real fried potato chips, but it's still very good.<br />Considering it's low in calories and it's only popped..  it taste much better than the ones that are freeze dried.<br />These pops taste as light as the rice crispy treats, but with a good amount of flavor and crunch.<br />I like it, a small little pack that you can just grab when you feel like having something quick.<br />I keep then in my room in case if I ever get the cravings for chips.<br />All the flavors that come in are good too, no complains.<br /><br />The package also arrived fast and it's pretty cheap, I would recommend people who is watching calories to get this!"
1859,1859,1859,1860,3,"Bought these based on the glowing reviews (4 1/2 Stars), and the fact that they were heavily discounted from the regular price. First of all .8 oz. per bag equals about 15 or 16 chips per bag, which is not many. While this may be fine for those who are trying to cut back on calories, fat or sodium, the fact is that .8 of an ounce is not much, and that might tempt people to eat more than one bag at a time.  Due to the discounted price each bag was around $.55 each, not to bad until you figure that equals $10 per pound. At the regular price its about $16 per pound. As far as the taste, all of the flavors were good, none that I absolutely disliked, but none that really rocked my socks either. Bottom line, at the discounted price I paid I was not disappointed, but if I had paid the regular price for these I would have felt cheated."
1860,1860,1860,1861,5,"It felt weird ordering 24 bags of chips off the internet that I had never even tried before, but I am SO GLAD I DID. They are delicious! I've tried 4 flavors so far & have loved each one. These are a win. :)"
1861,1861,1861,1862,3,I actually purchased these. I myself find that they taste just like those like rice crisp with salt and flavoring. From the reviews I thought they was more like munchos. They are not. BBq to salty but if you like a little twang its ok. according to the family. Plain is horrible. Salt and vinegar was the best overall. My family gave it 3 stars i will stick to kettle chips-
1862,1862,1862,1863,5,We have these suto delivered.  They are a great healthy sub for potato chips and the snack bags are a perfect size.  Great crunch and we enjoy all the flavors.
1863,1863,1863,1864,5,These are my favorite chips! The BBQ and Salt & Pepper are the best!<br /><br />The texture of these things ROCK!<br /><br />All nicely packaged.<br /><br />Gluten free if you care. I don't but some have commented on that.
1864,1864,1864,1865,5,These chips are tasty and low in calorie.  If you are gluten free they are a great option as a to-go snack.  We love them.
1865,1865,1865,1866,5,The product arrived quickly. All bags and chips were in place...and safe ;-D These chips are delicious and only four WW points!
1866,1866,1866,1867,3,"I like to take my lunch to work and this is perfect to give me just enough chips that I can munch on with my lunch. I love the flavors and the packaging is perfect. Worth the buy!  The price is right, the flavors are just what they want, portion size is good thus it's a win, win situation for me and them."
1867,1867,1867,1868,4,"Overall the chips were very tastey. My pickey daughter even liked then so that is a real plus for me. Some flavors were better but all did meet my expectations. Try it and see for yourelf, Enjoy."
1868,1868,1868,1869,5,"This chips are really good and it's fun getting the variety pack.  Now, are they as good as ""regular"" chips?  Probably not, but they're also not nearly as fattening and bad for you as regular chips.  Given that these are a healthier version if you want chips, I would highly recommend them!"
1869,1869,1869,1870,5,"I ordered this case of chips as a deal with some vita coco and it was a stellar deal. This size bag is perfect for snacking. The assortment of chips is great, there's something in there for everyone."
1870,1870,1870,1871,4,Love pop chips! The assortment package was a great find but would liked to be able to choose the flavor varieties I  wanted. Did not care for the sea salt and vinegar flavor but all the rest were great!
1871,1871,1871,1872,3,"I really like the pop chips, but I do not like all the flavors. The only ones I like are the originals.  The rest of these flavors were really not good.  At least not in my family.  I gave them away to a senior center and most of the seniors didnt like them.  Sorry but it is a matter of taste and most things should stick to the originals, they are the best.<br /><br />This snack (originals) fits into my daily ww program for allot less money then snacks made for the programs specifically.<br /><br />I will continue to buy the originals and leave the others to others."
1872,1872,1872,1873,5,"Delicious, light and full of flavor. It's difficult to decide what my favorite flavor is, but BBQ is amazing! I was impressed with the packaging, but I can't imagine it is too cost efficient or eco-friendly. That is my only complaint. Great product and guilt-free snacking."
1873,1873,1873,1874,5,"Love these popchips.  They are all great.  Do not care for the salt & pepper flavors.  I wish manufacturer would come up with a variety pack that didn't include that flavor as that flavor is just wasted with each purchase I make (and I've made alot!).  The BBQ, Original, Salt & Vinegar and Sour cream & onion chips are superb!"
1874,1874,1874,1875,5,"I love Popchips. They may take some time getting used to if you're used to the oiliness of potato chips, but they're only 100 calories per bag. Buying a 24 pack saves you money per bag, but you're sooo tempted to eat them with so many bags around!"
1875,1875,1875,1876,3,"Good texture: they are crunchy and not sharp (will not cut mouth)<br /><br />Flavor: They do not taste like potato chips. If I had not just opened the bag I would suspect they were stale. But no this is how they taste. Many others have remarked about the odd flavor as well.<br /><br />Healthy: good for dieting I suppose, low oil, and low salt<br /><br />I will not be buying these again."
1876,1876,1876,1877,5,"I'm very picky when it comes to chips. I've gone through so many, but this one really hits the spot. It has just the right amount of crunch, with just the right amount of flavor. It's also great to know that you're not eating something that's bad for you. With 100 calories a pack, it's definitely the ideal snack!"
1877,1877,1877,1878,4,"I loved this product, and it was better than what I thought it was going to be. My favorite was teh salt and vinger flavor (yum yum) but I hated the cheddar, and salt & pepper ones."
1878,1878,1878,1879,4,"I am not going to lie. I will give you the strait dope. These things are like crack.<br /><br />I will polish off about 4-5 pages of these EASILY in a day (hence the freshman 50! that I have gained!) lol.<br /><br />If you love these, I suggest balancing them out with some kind of carb blocker."
1879,1879,1879,1880,5,"+Really really tasty<br />+Much healthier than almost every other potato chip<br />+A variety of flavors, consider this a huge sampler<br /><br />-Sea Salt & Vinegar is crazy sour. Personally, I think they overdid it on the vinegar.<br />-It's hard to stop at one serving, but I take this as a sign of a good snack :P"
1880,1880,1880,1881,5,"My subscription of popchips arrived on time and not damaged.  I love the fact that I receive a great variety of chips which are healthier and at the same time very tasty and satisfying. The way the chips are packed for shipping is perfect! Having a subscription is the way to go and of course the price is so right!!!<br /><br />Thank you,"
1881,1881,1881,1882,5,"These were awesome!! They have a great crunchy texture and flavor and are very filling. I bought the variety pack to try all the flavors. Didn't care for the salt and pepper, but loved the rest. Will definitely buy more!"
1882,1882,1882,1883,5,It is so wonderful to eat Pop Chips.  I am a loyal fan and will continue.  Tasty AND Healthy.<br /><br />/the flavors are good too and pleasing to everyone with their various choices.
1883,1883,1883,1884,5,what can I say... if you've had popchips in the past and love them... then no better place to pick them up... I love these chips and have bought them without an issue from Amazon.<br /><br />Thanks
1884,1884,1884,1885,4,"I won them off a penny auction site. My 2 year old likes them plenty. I don't think there is any potato flavor, they taste more like ricecakes to me, but are ok. The salt and vinegar is strong holy cow!!"
1885,1885,1885,1886,1,"These chips arrived in terrible condition. The box they were sent in was a display box with all the usual perforations on the box for display. Why someone would send a box like that in the mail and not have put it in another real box is beyond me. The box we received was heavily taped to keep it together since the box came open on the display perforations and looked like someone had driven over the box as well, which gives you an idea of the shape of the box. The chip bags inside were pretty flat, there were no chips, but plenty of crumbs for any use you would need crumbs for. This is how many of the packages looked, flat. There were a few with edible chips, but not many. Not sure what to think of shipping chips in this type of a box, common sense should have been used??"
1886,1886,1886,1887,3,Next time I will order only the original flavor.  The other flavors did not suit me.  Too much of an aftertaste.
1887,1887,1887,1888,4,"I do love PopChips. They work well with weight watchers, taste great and the crunch can't be beat. This pack has many flavors, with the salt and vinegar being my favorite, my husband loves the salt and pepper and my kids like original and cheddar.<br /><br />The one I miss is Sweet Potato. It is by far my favorite of the whole lot of flavors, but aren't included in this variety pack."
1888,1888,1888,1889,5,"I was looking for a quality, low points (Weight Watchers (WW)), crunchy, salty snack.  I cannot stay on a diet if I feel deprived. WW's website had a coupon for these pricey chips.  Never had a ""popped"" chip before, so I gave it a whirl.<br /><br />Wow, the best crunch and flavor of all reduced-calorie chips I have ever tried.  Better than other brands' popped chips I have tried since.  I need portion control help and these little bags for 3 points do it for me.  The variety pack helps to break up any monotony.  My favorite flavor is the BBQ.  I am not a vinegar kinda guy.  The Salt and Vinegar flavor tastes like feet to me.  Love the rest of the flavors.  I love salt, so the saltiness is just right for me.  Thank goodness my blood pressure is not an issue.  I need these snackies.<br /><br />Lost 30 pounds so far in 3 months eating these.  Will probably buy them by the case in the Amazon auto order system to save on shipping.  I guess I plan on being a life-long fan. ...until something better comes along."
1889,1889,1889,1890,5,"These are such a treat when you are craving that salty, crunchy snack. And the multi-box where you get a variety of flavors is perfect. Share it with son so they don't get stale but not much chance of that.  One of my ""3 Points plus"" Weight Watchers Snacks that I don't run out of!"
1890,1890,1890,1891,2,"The only flavor we could stand was the barbecue (which was the reason we purchased them in the first place)!  I had to give the others away!!!  I won't be buying this again for lunches although the size/packaging was great.  I just wish the other flavors tasted better (plain, salt, pepper, etc., weren't really kid-friendly)."
1891,1891,1891,1892,5,"Got these at a fraction of the price that they charge at the grocery store. This was a great buy. Thanks, Amazon!"
1892,1892,1892,1893,3,"These taste alright, but they are health food by no means. At least regular potato chips are just greasy potato slices. This products is made of processed potato by-product and is natural by no means. The calorie savings isn't even significant enough to give up the better taste of potato chips. Also keep in mind that the healthiest part of a potato chip is the oil (if eaten in moderation) because of the healthy dose of balanced fats. In my opinion if you want a healthy chip eat sun chips or a cracker like triscuits. If you want a potato chip eat a real potato chip. If you feel these taste better than the above, then by all means enjoy, but don't be tricked into believing these are healthy at all.<br />Overall 4 stars for taste and 2 stars for the marketing scam that they are."
1893,1893,1893,1894,5,I have subscribed these chips. They are so tasty. Not dry or oily. Cannot put it down once open a bag and have to have two bags in a row.
1894,1894,1894,1895,5,"I love these chips. They are so delicious, it is so hard to eat just one bag. All the flavors allow you to taste them all.  My favorite flavor is the cheese ones. Go ahead and try them.  They are so delicious."
1895,1895,1895,1896,3,"I purchased these because I was hoping for a healthy alternative to chips. Well, they're fairly healthy: absolutely no oily residue on the hands and very light and airy. However, I just couldn't get over the taste, which I can only liken to slightly burnt popcorn. If that undercurrent of ""burnt"" flavor wasn't there, these might have been more palatable, but my taste buds kept zeroing in on that one aspect. Also, the seasonings weren't consistently strong. Cheddar was o.k. Bbq was probably the closest match to regular potato chips...the flavor was straight from a bag of Lays. However, I was very disappointed with the Sour Cream and Onion which was just too light in flavor and the Vinegar and Salt which didn't have as strong a tang as I would have liked.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend these to someone who wanted to eat healthy and didn't mind a watered down version of a fried chip. However, I just couldn't stomach them. I gave away the unopened bags to coworkers (none of which were impressed either but they're not on diets...lucky dogs). For now, I'll stick with my baked goldfish and bunny crackers."
1896,1896,1896,1897,5,"I found these chips originally at a local market.  However, I have been unable to find them since.  WHEW!  what a relief when I was able to locate them.  These chips have so much flavor, they're not greasy and they are crunchy.  I am a chip-a-holic and these are by far the best chips I have ever eaten."
1897,1897,1897,1898,5,"These chips are great. Delicious and are healthier than your regular deli store chips. I have first purchased these from a supermarket and found them delicious. I found amazon to have them cheaper, and ordered from them as they had more variety of flavor. All the flavors were to my liking. The only con about this is that THEY ARE ADDICTING!!!. You are warned! I purchased these through Amazon."
1898,1898,1898,1899,5,"these are the best chips ever. I will buy them again, wish more stores had them.The plain chips are my fav."
1899,1899,1899,1900,2,"These chips taste so dry and gross, I would rather eat carrots or something than these. They just didn't satisfy the salty craving and weren't worth the calories."
1900,1900,1900,1901,5,"I'm sort of a health nut who has weened myself off highly-palatable junk food. Junk food is delicious but it ain't good for you. Conversely, healthy food has a bad rep for being disgusting but I honestly think that it's just something that requires training and acclimatization.<br /><br />I really like PopChips. They don't taste absolutely amazing to be honest but if you're someone who is trying to kick junk food out of your diet, this is a good way to fulfill a craving without succumbing to unhealthier junk foods. Each bag is only 100 calories, which is very helpful for portion control.<br /><br />For me, the taste is great. It's not amazing but it isn't awful. Sure there are better tasting chips out there but how much more unhealthier are they?<br /><br />I've tried small bags of PopChips from the vending machine (which I recommend doing before you buy a case). I haven't tried all over the flavors until I bought the case and I was a little disappointed with half of the flavors in the box. Fortunately, my boyfriend and I disagree on what tastes good so he likes the flavors I don't like and vice versa. It works out great for us and probably will work out great for family situations and parties where people usually don't have the tastes. However, if you plan on consuming these bags on your own over time I can almost guarantee that there will be a couple flavors that you won't like and it might just be worth it if you just buy a couple bags of flavors you do like.<br /><br />If you're not accustomed to the taste of 'healthy' food, you might not enjoy these at first. Either way, pop chips are worth a try. Probably not by the case though. i recommend trying out a few flavors if you can find a small bag at the shop or vending machine before you buy a big box of them."
1901,1901,1901,1902,4,"I bought these to try them out and for the most part it was a success. There are 6 different flavors of chips. 5 of them were really good. The last one though was not. The salt and vinegar ones were very vinegary and it was too bitter for our tastes. Maybe some people like it but not us. All in all though, they were mostly very good in both taste and caloric content.<br />I would definitely buy a box with the flavors that I wanted."
1902,1902,1902,1903,4,"This practically falls under the category of healthy snack - well, almost.  Single serving bags mean you won't be overeating and the fact that these aren't in anyway greasy because of the way they are made is a huge plus.  Nice crisp crunch.  The bags are filled with air, which for the most part do a good job of keeping the chips whole.  On the case that I got, though, two bags containted nothing but broken bits.  Of the rest most only had a couple of broken chips - some no broken ones at all.  I also noticed that you don't find nearly as much coating from flavoring on your fingers as I've experienced when eating other chips.<br /><br />Purchasing it by the case to try out all of the flavors is a good idea and a decent value.  Some of the flavors are incredibly strong, to the point that I don't like them, so I won't be ordering this mixed case again.  Salt and Pepper just tasted like pepper, making this a very hot tasting chip.  The Seasalt and Vinegar is really strong on the Vinegar, which is a taste I don't enjoy.  I love BBQ flavored chips, but again, this was kind of strong.  I probably wouldn't purchase the BBQ ones in the future, but wouldn't say no if someone offered them to me.  The Original is really bland compared to these others, but not bad.<br /><br />The ones I liked the most were the Sour Cream & Onion and the Cheddar, both with milder flavors.<br /><br />I'd give this 5 stars if I liked all of the flavors.  Definitely high marks for the type of chip and the size of the serving and the fact that you can try all of the flavors in one order."
1903,1903,1903,1904,5,"Yes people, these things are healthier than the average chip and not only have flavor, but they taste good! I am not a big health food person, I'll take the grease if it makes it taste better. These are 100x better than those baked chips. My brother tried them while he was visiting and liked them so much it was one of the things he asked I mail him while deployed. Only draw back to these chips, they are definitely not for dipping."
1904,1904,1904,1905,5,"Tried the BBQ Popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors. Loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which weren't that great. Good healthy snack without giving up the taste. So glad I discovered these! Salt and vinegar are my favorite! 100 cal/bag, 3.5g fat/bag"
1905,1905,1905,1906,5,The chips were delicious. I didn't care much for the vinegar flavored chip but the other flavors were great. Didn't have any guilt eating this healthier snack.
1906,1906,1906,1907,5,I eat a bag of these every single day!  They are the best tasting good for you snack! Everyone should at least try them and you will be hooked.
1907,1907,1907,1908,5,"Cheetos ever since I was kid were one of my favorite snacks,I mean who wouldn't like them? You can't go wrong with the original but decided to give this one a try. I'm not a fan of unbearably hot foods but I do like things with with a kick and since this had Jalapeno in it I was assuming it was hot...not so much. If you eat mildly hot foods this shouldn't bother you at all and definitely not if you like hot kind of food. I didn't even find them hot just have a unique kick of cheddery Jalapeno flavor. I would recommend to buy these at your local store if they carry them because this price on here is just insane, i buy mine for a little over 3 dollars for this bag. Overall I hope they decide to keep this one, cause they are amazing. And yes girls like these kind of snacks too :)! Love!"
1908,1908,1908,1909,5,"For you spicy lovers, these jalape&ntilde;o Cheetos are for you. The taste is great and I admit I did not expect them to be this good. One day I picked up a small bag at the corner store and by the end of the week I had about 4 empty bags in my Trash cans. Office snack a must! Unfortunately this product is too good to last and I fear it will meet the same fate as Wasabi Funyuns. Rarely does a spicy type of chip that actually tastes awesome become part of the standard sale roster. So enjoy these Awesome Jalape&ntilde;o Cheetos for as long as they last."
1909,1909,1909,1910,5,"These are quite tasty and delicious, I love them....BUT the prices here are RIDICULOUS!!! Did I say Ridiculous? Oh So RIDICULOUS!!! But Im here to rate the product not the price...5 Stars for the Product."
1910,1910,1910,1911,5,"A little costly but they are good and fresh too, not stale at all. Would recomend to any Cheetos fan."
1911,1911,1911,1912,2,"I bought this because I had been seeing this pod in magazines and other places. I thought it would be a great addition to my fridge to save money on cilantro. However, this is very poorly designed. I could not open it whats-or-ever, even after searching through reviews after reviews. Finally, my genius boyfriend found the solution! Basically, you will need to open it from the BOTTOM. You will need to squeeze the two sides next to the cap in order to open it. You will have to be careful when you are opening or closing it while there's water in the pot. If any one who is reading this still having problem opening it. Let me know. I'll try to explain it better there. But anyway, this is a pretty useless product for its productivity, but a bit more useful if you are too lazy to make your own, and wants a prettier fridge. You can make you own with a cup (or any container) filled with a bit of water and wrapped in plastic bag with the herb....(so unless you have money to waste, don't buy this useless pot)."
1912,1912,1912,1913,5,"This product works great for me.  I hate spending money on herbs just to use a little and have the rest go bad shortly after.  I put some herbs (mostly basil) in here and they were fresh for a few weeks!  No leakage probs either, the bottom is clearly labeled to twist to lock and the plug stays flush.<br />This thing has already paid for itself in money saved and looks pretty cool in my fridge and on the counter when I'm ready to cook."
1913,1913,1913,1914,5,"I have had my herb savor for a few weeks now, and I was waiting to write a review until my herbs went bad, so I could tell you how long it takes, but it never happened. For the first time ever, I used all of the herbs before they went bad. I have not had any problems with leaking. Everything closes up nice and tight on mine. Plus, this thing just looks really cool!"
1914,1914,1914,1915,3,I bought this as a gift for my mother. She likes it but says it is hard to open. When she unwrapped it I remember having to help her figure out how to open it. It took me a minute. If you have arthritis you won't be able to pry this open!
1915,1915,1915,1916,2,"I have had the herb pods for about 6 months.  They are a great concept, but have a poor design. The plastic cover is very hard to take off and snap back on.  I'm  constantly afraid that I'm going to break it.  The pods do keep herbs fresh for several weeks in the fridge as long as you replace the water.  Unfortunately I don't use them half of the time I buys herbs because they are more trouble than they are worth."
1916,1916,1916,1917,2,"With no clear instructions on how to open and close the unit, the first few times are an act of frustration.  When I finally realized that if I grip with my thumb and forefinger over the clear plastic shield, about one third from it's bottom and squeeze the sides, the bottom lip pops out nicely.<br />I will agree that this size is too small for most popular herbs like parsley, basil ect.  The company does now make a larger unit and it looks like it is more user friendly.<br />All in all I like it, I took away one star for the lack of instructions.<br /><br />3/2012: After a few months I have thrown this thing away.  It became increasingly harder to open and the size was just too small for the herbs I use most.  I have seen some newer, larger units that don't have the issue with opening it like this one has...I'm going to order one of these.<br /><br />I no longer recommend this unit and have lowered it to 2 stars."
1917,1917,1917,1918,1,"Despite reading the reviews of others on how hard this was to open, I was confident I knew the secret so would be fine. Not so. No matter what I did, couldn't pop off the clear plastic lid. Instructions showed the bottom part screwing off, didn't. Husband couldn't even do it and he opens everything for me. He finally got it open, only held about half of the aspargus which is what I wanted it for so tossed it in the garbage and then bought one from Progresso that we both can open. Note to self, pay MORE attention to what people are saying."
1918,1918,1918,1919,2,"The reviews on this are so true. Great idea, but such a pain to pop the clear lid off from the side, even once I figured it out. I keep waiting for it to break in my hands because it does take some pressure to pop off the lid - but it feels fragile and likely to break with too much pressure. I would consider buying one of the new designs that seem sturdier and open from the top (not the side)."
1919,1919,1919,1920,5,I've had trouble storing fresh basil because I learned a long time ago not to put it in the fridge.  My cat is attracted to anything in the plant family (with disasterous results).  This keeps my basil fresh and the cat ignores it!
1920,1920,1920,1921,1,"I rarely write reviews, but these pods are so awful, I was hoping to save even one person from wasting their money like I did.  The little green plug barely stays in -- even after twisting it -- so the water is always sloshing out.  And the clear plastic cover is absolutely the worst design.  It is nearly impossible to remove and actually snapped into shards when I tried to open one of the pods.  (And I can attest that those plastic shards are sharp!)  If you are able to actually open the pod, be prepared for the water to splash out from the bottom.  Even if the pods actually worked well and preserved the herbs (which they don't really do), they would not be worth the aggravation or cost.  Like another reviewer said, just put your herbs in a cup with a little water in the bottom and a plastic bag covering the top.  Works perfectly and costs nothing.  Please don't waste your money on this!"
1921,1921,1921,1922,3,"I've had a couple of these for a few years but find that I don't use them all that often because their size & design limits their usefulness. For bushy herbs like cilantro or parsley it only holds a small bunch, and it's difficult to keep the bunch together while you snap the lid back on. Since the bottom cup is so shallow herbs tend to flop out the front unless you lay the pod down when first filling it. It works great for asparagus, but only for small-ish bunches and if the spears aren't too tall.<br /><br />More often than not I simply use a canning jar + 1/2"" of water with a plastic bag over the top, which keeps the contents just as fresh and allows for easier access. These pods do look much nicer in the fridge than a bag-topped-jar, however, and the clear front makes it harder to forget what's in there.<br /><br />They are definitely well made and not prone to leaking or tipping over. And the little drain port is fun to use.<br /><br />But it only works for small bunches."
1922,1922,1922,1923,3,I got one of these for XMAS...and to be honest it does work well and does extend the life of your fresh herbs while providing an attractive container.<br /><br />The main problem is the container is difficult to open. It does get easier over time but whoever designed this thing should not have made it so hard from the get go.<br /><br />The thing is its very easy to open when there is nothing inside it as you can you use as much force as needed open it (you don't need to open the bottom....just squeeze the sides and pull the plastic cover up and out FIRMLY). Don't worry...you won't break it. It is pretty sturdy plastic.<br /><br />The real issue is when it is filled or has water in it...its difficult to use that much force and popping it open without spilling.<br /><br />I've just resorted to emptying the water reservoir through its fill port....then popping it.<br /><br />PREPARA...please read these reviews and improve on the next design!!!
1923,1923,1923,1924,2,"Even with the tips shared on how to open it, it's still pretty difficult to open.  I guess I have weak hands. My husband usually has to open it for me, and even he doesn't do it with ease.  I would recommend getting the larger Prepara herb savor instead of the pod.  It's much easier to open and can hold more.  I could hardly fit any cilantro in the pod (considering that the grocery sells them in such large bunches and I only use half)."
1924,1924,1924,1925,2,"Saw this on Oprah's favorite things and thought it would make a great little Christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as I do. Since they come in packages of three, I kept one and gave two away. I couldn't open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time. I thought it was just too tight from the factory. My basil looked great after ten days. But when I went to use the basil, I could not open the pod. Husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. I tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. (Okay, maybe a little harder than 'lightly,' I was pretty frustrated.) Luckily I had emptied the water, so I only had a small mess to clean up. The pod went into the garbage...forcefully. I checked with my friends. Friend #1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. Friend #2 has now been warned. There were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments I've read, we're not the only ones who have had this problem. I think this was designed by the same guy that invented the  security wrapping/tape on music CDs! I've gone back to my old method...a wide-mouth mayo jar with pretty hair band holdingdown a circle of fabric...it works!"
1925,1925,1925,1926,2,"I wanted very much to like this product, but after using it for more than 9 months, I just can't. The clear plastic cover is very difficult to get off, especially when the pod is filled with water. It's also difficult to get the cover on, especially when you're trying to store bushy herbs like parsley or cilantro. The o-ring that is supposed to seal the bottom of the pod doesn't seem to seat correctly. After removing the bottom of the pod to clean out dirt left behind from some rooted herbs, I've never again been able to get it to be water-tight. Consequently, every time I use my pod,I have to store it in a bowl or else I'm mopping up water from my fridge shelf. On the plus side, the leaky bottom helps to remind me to change the water every day!"
1926,1926,1926,1927,5,"My wife bought me this for storing fresh herbs and despite initial skepticism I gave it a try. It seemed to work well enough for basil, even freshening up some wilted leaves... but the ""seal the deal"" moment was when I put some fresh thyme in it and put it in the back of my refrigerator where I mostly forgot about it. 6 weeks later (we were gone for 2 weeks on vacation) I opened it and the thyme was as fresh as the day it was cut. I doubt it would sustain all greens for this long but the fact that it kept thyme fresh for over a month longer than a plastic bag in the produce drawer would have made this an easy $10 to justify.<br /><br />It's always a nice surprise when a kitchen gadget delivers the goods."
1927,1927,1927,1928,5,"I bought one of these about 4 or 5 months ago - and I LOVE it!  I have kept a combination of Rosemary, Thyme and parsley.  They have all kept fresh for more than 4 WEEKS!  No brown spots, no rotten leaves - just perfect.<br /><br />I Highly recommend this product - no problems with leaks or the plug not holding."
1928,1928,1928,1929,5,"I am a college student who loves to cook and this was given to me about 4 months ago. I am so impressed with its ability to keep my herbs fresh for such a long period of time. It not only gives more options when I am cooking by having fresh herbs available, but also, its easy to clean, and stores easily in my small fridge. I really think this is a must have product for EVERYONE!<br /><br />And if interested in a larger one, I attached a link to the company site (Prepara), where you can see all their cool and innovative products.<br /><br />[...]"
1929,1929,1929,1930,1,"I've been told that the refrigerator of the future will have herb/vegetable/salad bins inside to grow vegetables and I thought the Prepara Herb Savor Pod looked like the perfect precursor. Wrong. The detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere. Similarly, the plastic plug at the back does NOT hold. A good idea, a nice-looking product, but poorly executed. Refrain from purchasing -- plastic bags are MUCH, much better."
1930,1930,1930,1931,1,"I threw this away after about a week of ownership.  Couldn't get the clear plastic cover on and off without spilling water all over, and half the time, I couldn't get it off at all.  It only works for long stemmed herbs, and all need to be about the same height."
1931,1931,1931,1932,5,Actually saves my basil and cilantro for an extra week or two. Thats enough reason for me to buy! Before my basil and cilantro would last only a couple days and I would have to toss them out. This saves me money and a trip to the market!
1932,1932,1932,1933,2,"The Prepara Herb Savor Pod is advertised holding asparagus. That was why I purchased it, thinking it would be good for keeping asparagus fresh. In reality the pod will hold very few spears and they would need to be quite thin and short.  The ad is misleading. I'll keep it for storing herbs, but asparagus is out of the question."
1933,1933,1933,1934,5,"I got this in my Christmas stocking from my stepfather.  We're both foodies, and try to cook like chefs in our homes.  I love this product.  I use this one for scallions/green onions which until recently always went bad before I could use all of them.  Sometimes I threw out more than 5, most times 2 or 3, but I honestly cannot remember the last time I used every single one.  That is, until now.  Inside the savor pod, they grow and keep for weeks (easily more than 3).  I am planning on buying the set of mini savor pods so I can actually use them for fresh herbs - storing my herbs in the same container as my onions is not a good idea.  The only drawback with this product is that the clear plastic cover is a little tricky to remove as others have mentioned, but wrestling with it is OK with me so long as I can use all my product before it goes bad."
1934,1934,1934,1935,1,"After I enptied the can, I noticed it was black in an area at the top of the can and appeared to be corroded. Of course I was afraid to eat the fruit, so I threw it away. I am waiting for a response from Native Forest to ascertain the type of metal can and if it is harmful. One would expect if they went to the effort to be certified as organic, they would use safe canning. I will post an addendum w/ their response."
1935,1935,1935,1936,1,After reading a previous review I carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there. I would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health!
1936,1936,1936,1937,1,This product was a complete disappointment. Tastes like mushy pineapple. There was no papaya taste.
1937,1937,1937,1938,1,"I will never buy this item again!! I was addicted to it until the last order!! Fruits had foul smell, tasted rotten!! Was the expiration dates forged!?"
1938,1938,1938,1939,5,"I was amazed at how good this is for canned fruit (which I normally won't touch).  In particular I adore papayas and mangos.  The fruit juice instead of syrup is also very nice.  The easy pull-top on the can makes this a great item to stash in my desk drawer at work, so that I can have a fruit snack easily even if I was too busy or forgot to bring lunch.  So far I haven't gotten a can that had any problems.  The watermelon isn't crunchy - of course not! - but it's good, and certainly not ""slimy""."
1939,1939,1939,1940,5,"This is great chilled and topped with fresh whipped cream.  It is my husband's new favorite dessert.<br /><br />I don't find the texture off-putting.  Of course, is isn't as crunchy as fresh fruit, but the taste is great.<br /><br />If I can get my husband to eat fruit instead of ice cream it gets an A in my book!"
1940,1940,1940,1941,3,"I tried Tropical Pineapple it was delicious. I gave a bad review for Tropical Fruit Salad becuase it had watermelon and pineapple in it I think the two of these were competeing for the flavor. I see now thats what I think it was, probably not a bad product at all. Sue"
1941,1941,1941,1942,5,"My 1 yr old Granddaughter, and I cannot get enough.<br />and it is good for you!"
1942,1942,1942,1943,3,"This fruit would be fine if it were not for the soft slimey textured watermelon and some other fruit that is in this can that is just slimey and icky. There are certain fruit that shouldn't be canned, and otherwise the crunchy pieces are fine. Much of the soft fruit I had to discard. Albeit, this item is good frozen and added to other fruit to make smoothie's then you don't have to taste the slime."
1943,1943,1943,1944,2,"EDIT:  I just noticed each bag is only 1.76 pounds, not 2.2.  My review is not 2 stars instead of three.<br /><br />First off, as you can probably guess by the pictures, these are sour gummies.  That isn't said in the description.  Also, each one is about 2 to 2 1/2 inches in length and 1/2 inch wide.<br /><br />Texture and flavor:  The came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings.  The sourness is average, not overwhelming but not too little.  Where I took off the 2 stars was the flavor (most important part).  As I chewed them, a few different flavors hit my tongue, none of which tasted that great.  I couldn't make out any of them in-particular (not good at that anyways) but the combination was just plain strange.<br /><br />I could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other 3 away to nephews/niece.  After all, they will eat anything sugar coated right?"
1944,1944,1944,1945,4,"I'm a big fan of the Dirty Martini - but I simply can't eat enough olives to keep up!<br /><br />Love this stuff - Not quite as tangy as Dirty Sue, but still very vibrant."
1945,1945,1945,1946,5,"We have reorderd this product many times...makes a great dirty martini..delivery is prompt, product well packed"
1946,1946,1946,1947,5,This is an excellent product.  We always ran out of olive juice before we ran out of olives when making dirty martinis.  Now we have a terrific source for great tasting olive juice and our dirty martinis have never been better!
1947,1947,1947,1948,4,"the last case (a different brand)we ordered from Amazon was so terrible we threw away the entire case.  However, the Boscoli brand is very good and we can enjoy a good dirty martini."
1948,1948,1948,1949,3,What are the white flecks floating in my recently ordered bottles of Dirty Martini Olive Juice?
1949,1949,1949,1950,5,If you like Bloody Mary 's and dirty martinies this is a must. You won't be sorry. I'm so glad I found this product.
1950,1950,1950,1951,5,This stuff is outragous. It is simply the best olive juice on the market. I tried another brand and it did not come close to Boscoli. This stuff is actually better than the olive juice that comes from the jar of olives. I would highly recommend this product.
1951,1951,1951,1952,5,"I've tried a few different 'Dirty Martini' mix's, etc. but I prefer the actual juice from the olive jar. Well, as any experienced dirty martini drinker knows; you soon have way too many olives and not enough juice. Boscoli Family Dirty Martini Olive Juice is the real thing. I usually buy 4 of the 25oz. bottles and that'll last me several months. Shipping is pricey but the bottles come not only packed in peanuts but also bubble wrapped. They pack 'em in a sturdy cardboard box and tape it up real well. I live in a rural area and usually get my order in about 4 days. Fantastic experience all the way around."
1952,1952,1952,1953,5,"He never has enough juice left over from his jar of olives, we therefore end up with more olives then we can eat, just buying the juice makes alot of sense."
1953,1953,1953,1954,5,"Excellent service & price for the product, order shipped quickly & received in good condition. Will be ordering again as long as the price stays this good. You really can't beat the price."
1954,1954,1954,1955,2,I purchased this item because it was cheaper than other olive juices. i was looking for a good quality olive juice for martinis. i was pretty disappointed. the juice is very strong. i followed the instructions and put the ratio on the bottle into the shaker and made a martini. the ratio was 2 part vodka to 1 part olive juice. it was way too salty. the olive juice was over powering. i made a decent dirty martini with 2 parts vodka 1/4 part olive juice. i would not recommend this item.
1955,1955,1955,1956,5,"The olive juice I purchased was not only inexpensive, but has a great flavor.  I have looked for a long time to buy olive juice for martinis, but I could not find anyone that carried it.  thanks Amazon."
1956,1956,1956,1957,4,"This product is great if you want a dirty martini, I highly recommend this product and it saves you from buying olives and wasting just to get the brine."
1957,1957,1957,1958,1,Ordered this a few months ago only to find it is just basically lactic acid.  Read the ingredients.  The main label says olive juice by no such thing.  I am going to suggest that Amazon take this off the website.
1958,1958,1958,1959,2,"This product is simply for cheap liquor since taste and quality is not important!  I prefer to drink my Grey Goose straight; however, on occasion it is absolutely delicious with a very tiny splash of olive juice.  This product was a a quick fix for me to stop purchasing olives in order to use the juice.  It's not worth it!!  The after taste is worse!!"
1959,1959,1959,1960,5,We use and buy sea salt instead of regular salt like sea salt came as promised in good condition have nothing else to say
1960,1960,1960,1961,2,"Sea salt is more easily administered with a salt mill. This is just a salt shaker that delivers uncontrollable amounts of sea salt and anti-caking agent into your food, and no iodide. The anti-caking agent isn't event that effective, so the salt either comes out in clumps or gets stuck at the exit. Stay away!"
1961,1961,1961,1962,5,"Love this Balance Blend of Oils , especially in mix batters such as : Pancake , Cornbread ,Cake , Etc... , a good oil to ingest !"
1962,1962,1962,1963,5,I used to buy these at World Market however they discontinued them :(<br />So I am forced to buy them online!  The rose and violet flavors are good however I did not like the anise flavor because they were too strong and licorice tasting for me.<br /><br />I carry these in my purse to freshen my breath and they are really good.<br />Also the tin is very cute.
1963,1963,1963,1964,5,"Can't live without these little jewels.  Not only is there a surprise in the middle, but it takes me right to the French countryside while enjoying them."
1964,1964,1964,1965,5,"A family favorite.  These are really unique treats.  The wonderful taste of flowers.  The violet and rose are great.  Orange blossom wasn't to my liking.  The company that makes them have been around for hundreds of years.  They are made in a small French town that was featured in a movie called ""Chocolat."""
1965,1965,1965,1966,5,"I love these.  I love any floral flavored product. The best part is when people ask for a mint or candy or whatever,  offer these but don't tell the flavor.  The reactions are YouTube worthy."
1966,1966,1966,1967,2,"This candy tasted like sugar without much rose flavor at all.<br /><br />I ended up throwing most of it out because I don't like so much sugar.... I prefer strong flavors like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KYOENE"">Altoids Twin Pack Mints, Wintergreen 2 tins</a><br /><br />The center of the candy does have a licorice flavor because it's an anise seed.  But there are better licorice candies out there like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JTZLK"">Twizzlers Twists, Black  Licorice, 1-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a>."
1967,1967,1967,1968,5,"I ordered these candies for the first time and I am hooked, they just have a hint of rose the flavor is not overwhelming. I really enjoy them. Highly recommended! Unique candy!"
1968,1968,1968,1969,5,"The flavor of this natural sea salt is more nuanced and a bit richer than the typical table salt we're all accustomed to, although describing such subtleties is difficult.<br /><br />One noteworthy fact is that this salt contains less sodium than conventional table salt - 330mg per 1/4 teaspoon, versus 590mg per 1/4 teaspoon of conventional table salt.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind is that this natural salt is NOT iodized.  As our thyroid glands require trace amounts of iodine, it may not be wise to entirely eliminate iodized salt from your diet."
1969,1969,1969,1970,4,"i like it and i find the grinder bottle to be very convenient. i like the taste of it and i would definitely buy it again, and considering its healthy use for sure."
1970,1970,1970,1971,5,"I bought this because my husband wanted to try the French sea salt as it was recommended on a cooking show.  The grinding mechanism works well and he seems to like it.  I did not realize, however, that it is not ""iodized"" and that may be a concern for some folks who need to make sure they take in enough daily iodine."
1971,1971,1971,1972,5,I really liked the taste. It is well priced too. It is a great and healthy alternative to table salt. I even used it on salad.
1972,1972,1972,1973,3,"I have never had sea salt before but the 95% sodium free got to me.  It has to be an acquired taste because I don't really like it --- perhaps if I used it regularly I would not want to go back --- and, perhaps if the salt came from other seas around the world it might taste different as well..."
1973,1973,1973,1974,3,The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry. Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme. Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem.
1974,1974,1974,1975,5,"This is a fabulous gift! I ordered 3 and kept one to try-and they are awesome! The presentation is great, chocolates delicate, creamy, crunchy, and tasty, easy to eat, not heavy. For a mass produced line, this is a real winner. Better than most out there in its price range. Love the 3 different flavors. Will buy again. Great hostess gift."
1975,1975,1975,1976,5,"I ordered this for a friend at South Carolina for Christmas, i want her to try some Italian chocolates, lol!<br /><br />The item was arrived earlier than expected, but, nevertheless, it was well packed and only melts on her mouth, she totally loves it.<br /><br />Three different taste and flavors of Ferreros guarantees to give three different yummy joy, Mmmmm...."
1976,1976,1976,1977,5,"This item was received early.  It was packaged well and in excellent shape!  This was a gift and I am sure it will be received well.  After all, Ferrero chocolates..what's not to like!!!<br /><br />Thanks for the excellent service.  Would use this seller again and would highly recommend!!"
1977,1977,1977,1978,5,"I bought this as my first pack of K-cups, its definitely a good buy! Assortments are always a little more expensive, this one is very well priced. you get 6 of each and one of them only has 5, thank god they picked decaf for the small one! Great coffee, if I hadn't discovered club keurig I would still be buying these!"
1978,1978,1978,1979,2,I too was a little disappointed with the mix of the Donut Sampler. In my case I had 12 of the 35 were decaf.  But I guess this is what you get when you purchase a sampler pack through the Amazon warehouse deals section.  All the k-cups had a best used by date of 6/2012.  I was happy about that atleast.
1979,1979,1979,1980,1,"I have had the regular Donut House coffee before and enjoyed it, but I had never had the flavored kind.  I was looking for a sampler pack to so my roommate and I could try the flavors as well as get some of the regular stuff.  I don't drink decaf, so I knew that some of this pack would not be used.  I figured that the rest of the cups would make up for the loss on the decaf.  I was wrong.  This ""Sampler"" pack was a joke.  18 of the cups were decaf, and 15 of them were the standard house brew.  I got 1 cup of Chocolate Glazed Donut and 1 cup of Cinnamon Roll.  Now, I will not be using most of the K-cups in this package because it was, again, MOSTLY DECAF!!!!!  This is what they consider a sample pack:<br /><br />8 Donut House Regular<br />9 Donut House Decaf<br />7 Donut Shop Regular<br />9 Donut Shop Decaf<br />1 Donut House Chocolate Glazed Donut<br />1 Donut House Cinnamon Roll<br /><br />Some sample....."
1980,1980,1980,1981,1,"My husband just bought a Keurig coffe maker. In the box was samples, his favorite was Donut Shop. I ordered the 35 K-Cup for him. I was so disappointed, out of the 35 k-cups 11 were decaf, giving me 6 k-cups of each of the 4 flavors.<br />I also ordered the Wolfgang Puck sampler, I got 12 flavors 4 each. How cool is that!<br />I would order Donut Shop again, just not the sampler."
1981,1981,1981,1982,1,"I ordered this because I have had the Donut Shop coffee before and really enjoyed it and wanted to taste some of the other flavors they offered.  After receiving my order of the ""sampler"" pack, I was very disappointed! Over half my order was decaf coffee and I only got 2 cups of the flavored coffee; which was the main reason I ordered it.  I love this coffee but am disappointed in the so called sampler pack or ""the lack of variety"" pack!"
1982,1982,1982,1983,2,"I got this on the warehouse deal so I wasn't expecting much. However, be advised you will get NO regular Donut Shop and instead you will receive over half of the box as decaf. I love the flavors of all of these though, so that's ok. But I will think hard about getting another variety pack."
1983,1983,1983,1984,5,"We'll see how these work out in our family over time. I'm not sure that I am disciplined enough to make good use of them, although it might be a good technique for teaching my dog. They appear to be good for what they are, a very tiny, but healthy, reward. Right now I can visualize them being used as a reward for following commands, a training tool. I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1/4 as thick.<br /><br />My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his ""treat"", looked at it as if to say, ""You've GOT to be KIDDING!"" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one.<br /><br />I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it.<br /><br />They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds. She'll probably inhale these, one second max.<br /><br />I like the fact that these are low-fat, with no added salt, no refined sugar, no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives. It says, ""Treats Baked With Natural Peanut Butter."""
1984,1984,1984,1985,5,I use these for training treats.  I have a large and small dog and this works for both of them.  They are all natural and my pups love the taste.  I highly recommend these!  I also tried the Three Dog Bakery Apple Oatmeal Woofers and those were a big hit.
1985,1985,1985,1986,3,"I have been using these treats for quite a while and both my dogs love them but both dogs are also way off their food and have been for quite some time and both have been acting kind of ""off""...nothing major but just not exactly right. Well, I just happened to quit using these treats for a week or so and noticed both dogs came back to life and they're eating like crazy. I cannot for certain pin it on these treats but it's something to keep in mind if you are using them and your pet seems a little off kilter."
1986,1986,1986,1987,5,"I've never been addicted to candy.  In fact, I don't usually like candy with the occasional exception of Halloween and that moment when you just need something sweet.  But these little guys, watch out.  It might SEEM like a 12 pack is a lot, but hold on to your seat when you put the very first one onto your vestal tongue.  A 12 pack will seem like there's a shortage of caramels in the world. LOL.<br /><br />I tried to come up with a way to explain the most awesome flavor in the world and I just can't.  To me it's like eating anything and everything in the world you ate that made you feel like ""Ahhh, that's it.""<br /><br />I can only hope that the gubment doesn't put a tax on it like cigs because then I'd have to put myself into an institution."
1987,1987,1987,1988,4,"I am a BzzAgent and I recently received a package of these to try.  I have to say that I absolutely LOVE the flavor of these candies.  I am usually not a big candy eater, but I have to say that I was really impressed.  The Werther's Chewy Caramels were so richly flavored and chewy that I couldn't stop at just one (I usually stop at one for most other candies).  They have a great buttery flavor that makes my mouth water just thinking about them.  I like the fact that they have some great ingredients, like cream and butter, but I had to deduct one star for the fact that there are artificial flavors in them (I am an avid label reader and try to stay away from any artificial ingredients).  As far as the taste goes, my kids and my husband were constantly in the pantry looking to grab another candy, so I can confidently say these were a huge hit in our family.  It was also a great incentive for the kids to eat their vegetables at dinner- they certainly cleaned their plate to have a couple of caramels for dessert.  If you are having a party, these would be great set out in a candy dish.  There will be none left by the end!"
1988,1988,1988,1989,5,"GREAT CANDY AS ALWAYS FROM WERTHER'S ORIGINAL CANDY, HARD OR CHEWY CARAMELS ARE BUT TWO OF THE CANDY THEY MAKE THAT IS OUTSTANDING. IT SEEMS THAT YOU CAN NOT KEEP IT IN STOCK AND ARE ALWAYS OUT OR JUST HAVE A BAG OR TWO LEFT TO SALE."
1989,1989,1989,1990,4,"I reviewed Werther's original chewy caramels, caramel chocolates, and creamy filled<br />hard caramels as a BzzAgent and found the chewy caramels came a close second to the<br />original hard candies.  Still has that great unique caramel flavor from Werther's but<br />now in a chewable form.  I prefer the original hard candy as those little gems last<br />a little longer but these are a nice second choice."
1990,1990,1990,1991,3,"If you like Werther's hard candies, you may like these. The pretty good caramels. But they are hard, and really sticky. Like ""do I have all my fillings?"" sticky.<br /><br />Eating a bag now. But I wanted caramels, and these really aren't. The are closely related, but so different, in terms of texture.<br /><br />Not my cup of tea. If you like your caramels really hard (not hard candy hard, but still), you may love these. If you think caramels should be soft and chewy, you may not.<br /><br />Now, I just tried warming them up, and that really helped. Almost tempted to raise it up to 4 stars. Don't microwave it though. That turns them into a bubbling mass of goo!"
1991,1991,1991,1992,5,I received this mix along with a waffle maker as a gift.  It's so good that I keep buying this same brand mix when I run out.<br /><br />I cut the Farmhouse Waffles recipe in half (so that's 1 cup Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix; 1 egg; 5/8 cup water; 2 tablespoon melted butter) and it's more than enough batter for 2 waffles in a full-size Belgian waffle maker.<br /><br />Easy to make and very tasty.
1992,1992,1992,1993,5,Nothing can compare to the waffle mix delivered by Stonewall kitchen.  My mom complained about the price but I think the quality deserves the higher price than the regular pancake/waffle mix.  The waffle comes out golden and crispy.  I was using the Presto 03510 FlipSide Waffle Maker.
1993,1993,1993,1994,5,"I have been making Belgian waffles using the Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix for over three years.  My waffles are undoubtedly the best ever!!!  I like my waffles light and crisp - I can't stand a heavy soggy waffle. These just melt in your mouth.  I have made homemade waffles, but I have yet to find anything that can compare to this mix."
1994,1994,1994,1995,4,This is a delicious recipe and ingredients and the one I use. A bit pricy but if you don't mind the price point it makes a wonderful waffle. Combine this with a Waring Waffle maker and you could be in Waffle Heaven.
1995,1995,1995,1996,5,"I have to laugh at the reviews that said it was too much work.  So you have to add an egg & a little butter!  It is well worth it.  I am not a cook at all and these come out perfect everytime.  They are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. My family loves, loves them.  The only thing different I do is instead of the extra 2 tbsp of water they call for, I add 2 tbsp of vanilla in place of. Best waffle mix!!"
1996,1996,1996,1997,5,"I had read some favorable reviews of this pancake mix on Amazon quite a while ago.  I had never ordered any, but I came across a can of it in one of those outdoor,camping stores last Christmas.  I have been using it ever since to make my dieting harder, and can honestly say I have never enjoyed the struggle so much.  Pancake mixes are usually one of those things that usually I buy the cheapest I can find, or at least one that I am familiar with.  I tend to balk at higher priced mixes for the most part. But every now and then I get curious of a brand like this one. It just so happens that when I visited this camping store, I was getting ready to take a short hike as soon as the holidays were over, and pancake mix has always been one of my staple items to take along.  Unfortunately it wasn't 'till I left that I realized that this mix was not one of the ""just add water"" ones that we all know and love.  The best ones always needed your own addition of eggs, milk, butter, etc, and this one is no exception in that respect.  So instead of enjoying this mix on the trail, I have been making pancakes in the wilds of my very own kitchen.  I really don't know what it is about this mix that makes it so good, but it does indeed make some of the best and most delicious pancakes I have ever tasted from a mix.  They are very light, fluffy, and flavorful, and well worth the price and ingredients that you have to add yourself.  If you have a pancake fiend in your home, I would highly suggest you buy some of this great mix. Its cheaper here on Amazon than I paid for it and well worth it in my opinion. I have had lots of different kinds over the years, and this makes some truly delicious pancakes.... Highly recommended..."
1997,1997,1997,1998,4,"I was expecting great things based on the reviews. While it IS good, it's not great. I believe my waffles made from Bisquick were just as tasty as these, and this costs quite a bit more. The instructions ARE very easy to follow though, and I DO like the canister for storage."
1998,1998,1998,1999,4,"I love this pancake mix.  I bought my first can from Whole Foods Market about a year ago.  My only complaint is, for all the work you have to put into making them (at least the pancakes anyway) you could just as easily make pancakes from scratch.  You have to add your own egg, whole milk, and melted butter.  One thing I have noticed about this mix is that it's relatively difficult to burn the pancakes.  It is, however, easy to overcook them."
1999,1999,1999,2000,5,"What can i say??  They are wonderful, and the highlight of each weekend.  OHHHhhh  - use soda water for the liquid !  even better !!!"
2000,2000,2000,2001,5,"I usually make pancakes from scratch and have never found a mix that doesn't taste ""off"" to me.  This mix is the best!!!  My family and I love the way it tastes and it is so quick and easy."
2001,2001,2001,2002,4,This is the best tasting pancake mix in the market and it is so easy to make.
2002,2002,2002,2003,5,"My family absolutely loves this pancake and waffle mix. The texture and taste is the best out there, especially when using our waffle maker. You can add fruit and other items to the mix and be as creative as you wish. Your price is great and delivery can't be beat. We recommend it to everyone!!"
2003,2003,2003,2004,5,"We use the Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix to make delicious Belgian Waffles in our <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BXM2LU"">Waring WMK300A Pro Professional Stainless-Steel Belgian Waffle Maker</a>. We have tried waffles using <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BQPZGE"">Krusteaz Waffle Mix Belgian 28-oz</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6BFE"">Golden Malted All Natural Waffle & Pancake Mix, 33-Ounce Containers (Pack of 3)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB1UJA"">Maple Grove Farms Waffle Mix Belgian, 24-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>, and the waffle recipe from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JYTSY"">Aunt Jemima Pancake Mix, 32-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. In a highly (un)scientific blind taste test involving my three children, the Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle mix was the unanimous choice.<br /><br />I make a triple batch according to the instructions--although i use only one tablespoon of melted butter instead of three--and the batter stores well in the fridge for up to four days. The triple batch makes 4 1/2 waffles on our waffle maker and they are crispy, light, and golden brown.<br /><br />This brand is slightly more expensive per waffle than the normal grocery store brands (like Krusteaz), but our family thinks the taste is worth it. As an aside, my son has a soy allergy and this mix is free of soy--unlike most other brands."
2004,2004,2004,2005,5,"I love Belgian waffles and this mix makes a delicious waffle without all the trouble of making them from scratch.  They are really good, and I'm fussy.  I haven't tried them as pancakes yet."
2005,2005,2005,2006,1,"I used to buy Bob's Red Mill Organic 7 Grain Pancake & Waffle, Whole Grain Mix until I saw all these rave reviews about StoneWall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle mix. I decided to order from Amazon and tried it this morning.<br /><br />This pancake mix is very fine and powdery. When I made my pancake mix, the mix was all over my kitchen floor. The mix is almost foamy like when it is done mixing. The waffle recipe from the label asks for 2 Tbsp. of melted butter, which I never use that much when I use the Rob's Red Mill pancake mix. I could only make two perfect 7"" round pancakes from it even though it claims the serving should be 3-4 pancakes. The pancake is indeed fluffy as others claimed in the review. However, I also tasted a lot of chemicals in it. I guess one reason it is so fluffy is a lot of baking soda in the ingredient. Looking at the ingredient label did I realize it has more chemicals than other brands. And I do not understand what ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR it has to be added in when this pancake mix is just the normal type with no fancy flavors like Cinnamon and Apple, etc.<br /><br />In short, I am going back to my Rob's Red Mill brand, at least I know what I am digesting in my stomach."
2006,2006,2006,2007,2,"Didnt really enjoy these after wanting to try something other than aunt jemima's from Dominicks. The pancakes tasted strange and sometimes forgettable, but it might have been due to the poor packaging they came in along with the syrup."
2007,2007,2007,2008,5,These pancakes just hit the spot and make me feel like I am eating a restaurant breakfast at home for a lot less money. Splurge on this and the good maple syrup...it really is cheaper than going to Denny's or IHOP where a meal for two will be $20 minimum.
2008,2008,2008,2009,4,Let me start by saying my family loves this stuff.  It has a fairly strong flavor of vanilla.  It cooks up nicce and light.  My problem with this product is the recent price increase.  It was a good product at a fair price but now it is pricey.  All-in-all I would suggest that you order this at least once to taste what good pancakes are supposed to taste like.  After that I would suggest playing with recepies on your own.
2009,2009,2009,2010,5,My family was lucky enough to get this product several years ago from a friend.  My daughter will not eat any other pancake mix and everyone I fix them for thinks they are outstanding.
2010,2010,2010,2011,5,"I bought a Belgian waffle maker sort of on a whim and I was then confronted with the question: What waffle mix do I use? Somehow ""Hungry Jack"" felt like an afront to such a sublime kitchen appliance. I read the reviews here on Amazon and concluded that despite the rather high price, Stonewall would be a great choice. Bang! Nailed it the first time. Now, I don't know if my waffle maker is particularly large/deep, but I get only two and one half waffles out of each batch (following the recipe on the label). I don't dare water it down to try to stretch it out and I figure I only got about 10 batches of waffles out of one can. The cost-per-waffle is steep, but these have never failed to come out light on the inside, slightly crisp on the outside, and they have NEVER stuck to the waffle iron. Grudgingly, even though I see the price has gone up a dollar per can, I will be reordering, but if it goes up any higher, I may have to try another brand."
2011,2011,2011,2012,5,"I'm sorry not everyone likes this mix, but we love it. It is like going to a gourmet restaurant! (yeah - a gourmet WAFFLE restaurant...) The waffles taste and turn out great, and so easy. Hard for us to believe, but it seems it's not for everyone."
2012,2012,2012,2013,4,"This is the pancake mix we go to when we don't have buttermilk in the fridge (don't think the vinegar trick is worth it so we always do fresh) to make Alton Brown's buttermilk pancake recipe.  This Stonewall mix is a good option and the flavor is the best of any store bought mix by far! It might cost more, but it really is superior to the other prepared mixes."
2013,2013,2013,2014,5,"Stonewall Kitchen products are a big favorite at our house.  This pancake mix makes the best pancakes you will ever eat.  We add fresh blueberries to them, and top them with the Stonewall Blueberry Syrup, which you can buy on their website.  They make wonderful jams and jellies too, as well as sauces, and flavored syrups.  Try this pancake mix though, you won't be disappointed!"
2014,2014,2014,2015,5,This is great pancake and waffle batter that was recommended by Amazon so I bought it and have been very satisfied with my purchase.  It makes the best waffles every time I have used it and that being said I am sold on this product.  I will be ordering more as we really like how easy it is to make.  I would highly recommend that everyone try this who likes pancakes and waffles it is delicious and very economical.
2015,2015,2015,2016,5,I have been using this pancake and waffle mix for about 5 or 6 years and I have to say this is the best.  The waffles come out crisp on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  I've tried other mixes but they do not compare to this mix.  I use the Waring Pro Waffle Maker and my waffles come out beautiful everytime.  I follow the directions on the canister and never have a problem with the results.
2016,2016,2016,2017,5,"This is THE king of pancake mixes.  Easy, foolproof, and delicious, it makes the best pancakes I've ever tasted.  We've been buying it for several years, and the pancakes consistently come out light and delicious.  Simply add an egg, buttermilk, and melted butter.  Cook them on a nice hot skillet for a yummy anytime meal!"
2017,2017,2017,2018,5,"Makes perfect, delicious, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, waffles in minutes. Worth every penny!"
2018,2018,2018,2019,5,"I purchased this mix to use with my new Presto FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker and am very pleased with the results.  It took 3 cups of this mix to make 6 large Belgian Waffles and they cooked to perfection after only 4 minutes!  The flavor of this mix is slightly sweet but there is no aftertaste to it like you get with cheap commercial brands like Bisquick.  I'll be buying more, for sure!"
2019,2019,2019,2020,5,I received this as a gift a few weeks ago.  It is by far the best home made pancakes I have every had.  The taste and consistancy is excellent.  Blueberries mix very well with this product and the container is desinged to keep the product fresh and not let moths in.  You pay a little more but it is worth it in my opinion
2020,2020,2020,2021,5,"Makes very good, light waffles. Seems to be exactly the same as Carbon's Golden Malted waffle mix. Only this is more expensive."
2021,2021,2021,2022,5,"Bought a great waffle maker two years ago.  Tried many recipes for making waffles, nothing really pleased the family. Well, until I followed a recommendation to try Stonewall Waffles.  Believe me it is not like Bisquick as I thought it might be, it is so much better I was shocked.  And well now the family loves them and looks forward to Sunday waffles every couple weeks.  I even double up the ingredients so I can make extras which we cut into smaller sections and freeze them.  These can then be used for toster waffles and a quick breakfast.  Forget the Eggos even as frozen waffles these are great.<br /><br />What do I like best about them?  The waffles come out light and fluffy.  They are crisp and hold up well to being filled with strawberries, nuts or whatever toppings you may choose.  In no way do they feel heavy or soggy.  They are a snap to prepare, and take just 3 minutes in the waffle maker. Lastly the whole family loves them.  So despite the higher price it is well worth every penny."
2022,2022,2022,2023,5,Bought this mix along with the Cuisinart waffle maker.  Delicious.  We followed the directions and it made only one Belgian waffle.  The next time we doubled the recipe and it came out the right amount.  Good flavor and easy to use.
2023,2023,2023,2024,5,I have a Waring belgian waffle maker and was looking for a good batter to use. I tried this based on reviews and with add my strong recommendation for this mix.<br /><br />It was very easy to make and the waffles had a wonderful flavor ... loved the malt flavor that came through.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying more when the current mix runs out.
2024,2024,2024,2025,5,This mix makes great tasting waffles.  A little extra work and expense but worth it.  Need to stretch the recipe a little bit to make 2 full waffles on my new Presto Flipside Belgian Waffle Maker.
2025,2025,2025,2026,4,"I got this as a gift and liked the flavor but I wasn't crazy about the texture.  I like fluffy pancakes and believe it or not, imo, Aunt Jemima's buttermilk ready mix is the best one out there and it's so easy to make.<br />Of course, the best tasting waffles are made by me from scratch with buttermilk and all.=)<br />Overall, I think buying gourmet pancake mix is one of the biggest waste of money.  And it still requires you to put melted butter, milk, etc.<br />I am sticking with my own recipes and Aunt Jemima's if I am in a hurry."
2026,2026,2026,2027,5,Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix is our favorite.  Consistently excellent with a nice malty flavor.  The 33 ounce cans are a Good value for the quality. I highly recommend this product.
2027,2027,2027,2028,5,This mix is the kids' and family favorite. It tastes like vanilla. It's wonderful for pancakes or waffles.
2028,2028,2028,2029,3,"Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix is definitely a mouthful in name but, in taste, not so much.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad but, you could find any number of ""mixes"" that taste just as well and some even better.  I know my taste buds aren't the same as yours so, what's just decent to me may be great to you.  I also wish I had bought just one can instead of 2 huge 33 ounce cans.  I finished the first can, I'll give the other can away and, I'll continue trying other mixes until I find the ""best mix"" out there.<br /><br />So far I seem to only be satisfied with a homemade mix for my waffles.  My preference is for waffles over pancakes but, this didn't make it on either count.  I even tried adding things to it but it didn't really help.  Maybe it's just me.  Try it if you like but remember, buy only one can just in case you're like me.  You can always buy more."
2029,2029,2029,2030,5,This waffle and pancake mix is delicious!  You can taste a subtle hint of vanilla in them.  They are the only pancakes/waffles that my kids love and the house smells wonderful when they are cooking!
2030,2030,2030,2031,5,"My family loves waffles. We have been trying to make homeade waffles for a while but when my second child was born, we got tired of all the mixing and measuring. We chose this batter mix because the reviews were so great. They take no time to mix. The dough comes out a bit runny but if you fill the bottom of the waffle iron completely, you get the fluffiest Belgian waffles. We are using the Chefman rotatable iron. I highly recommend this batter if you like waffles quick. You can add a little cinnamon and sugar too to spice it up."
2031,2031,2031,2032,3,"I love this pancake mix. Can not find this exact one in any stores so I always order online and keep in stock at home. All you do is mix with water (I add fresh chopped banana's or strawberries for a healthy option, and swap syrup for honey) and cook in a lil butter and you have an awesome breakfast."
2032,2032,2032,2033,5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E29A"">Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix, 33-Ounce Cans (Pack of 2)</a><br /> The family said they were the best that I had made. The 10 Grandchildren ate all that was served to them.<br />The parents, who I have served pancakes to for a long, also said they were the best they have eaton. It was good to see the little ones clean up their plates."
2033,2033,2033,2034,5,"We have pancakes once a week and this is our go-to mix. It is incredibly easy to prepare, and I add a handful of chocolate chips, pieces of banana/strawberries/peach slices or whatever else people would like onto the individual pancake while it is cooking in the pan. No need to buy different flavors you can customize it yourself."
2034,2034,2034,2035,5,We first had Stonewall Waffle Mix when we received it in a gift basket about a year and half ago.  We have been using it ever since.  The flavor of the waffles are absolutely out of this world.  We won't ever go back to Bisquick for our waffles!
2035,2035,2035,2036,5,"This has become a breakfast staple for our home. Now nearly every Sunday morning, we are making pancakes. We've got the Vermont Mapel syrup, eggs, sausage or bacon and we're set for the day with a just a light snack-type dinner. Use bettermilk for the absolute best results."
2036,2036,2036,2037,5,"Great mixed for Belgium waffles, family thinks it's the best.  Must try it and order it from Amazon.  I let friends know to use this product."
2037,2037,2037,2038,5,"I found it so hard to believe anyone could give this mix 1 star, I had to read those reviews. Two of them seem like ads for Robs Red Mill, and the other one didn't make any sense. You must be looking for pancakes or waffles, so do yourself a favor and give these a go. They are delicious"
2038,2038,2038,2039,4,"The entire family loved this pancake mix. It was easy to make and tasted great. We tried it with syrup, powdered sugar, as well as fresh strawberries and apple compote. I would definately purchase this again. The only problem is my family wants this every weekend and I have to double to feed my large family. It gets expensive quickly, so I do not order it as often as they would like."
2039,2039,2039,2040,5,"we love this pancake / waffle mix.  It's hard to please everyone but this item does the trick.  Crispy, light, tender, yummy!"
2040,2040,2040,2041,5,"This was the best pancake/waffle mix ever! Wonderful for breakfast or dinner. It was a great price and worth it! My husband and boys kept complimenting the waffles I made and ate them fast--I could hardly keep up. Definitely recommend Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse pancake and waffle mix! You do have to add a few ingredients, but it is well worth the effort."
2041,2041,2041,2042,5,"This product is great.  Just add egg, water, and butter (I used oil).  I will never make waffles from scratch again."
2042,2042,2042,2043,5,We made this purchase based on our daughter's recommendation and it is as good as she promised. We have a new flip-style waffle iron and this mix provides us with a wonderful breakfast. We add fresh strawberries or blueberries to the top along with syrup and it is scrumdiddlyumptous!
2043,2043,2043,2044,4,"I have had waffles from other mixes that are too sweet.  I have also made them from scratch.<br />I like my waffles with NO Sugar in them, because I don't like too much sugar.  This mix is very good.  Waffles are just the right consitancy for me and the mix is easy to prepare."
2044,2044,2044,2045,5,"We received a gift box that contained the Stonewall Farms Pancake Mix and they were out of this world. They are the lightest, fluffy and flavorful pancakes and waffles you will ever taste.  And the price on Amazon is a big savings over ordering from Stonewall Farms.  Don't shy away from the larger size and the two pack because you will devour these pancakes in no time."
2045,2045,2045,2046,5,"This is a GREAT waffle mix! I have allergies to preservatives and to find food in general that is great tasting without the preservatives is a huge challenge. I have tried several other mixes and this one is by far the best. I totally don't understand the reviews about the bad taste and ""all the chemicals""--read labels of other mixes and you will see this one is not full of all those ingredients. There are certain kinds of ingredients that these mixes need, such as levening, and when you use REAL butter, NOT the ""tub"" butter that contains water and other nasty stuff, these are THE BEST WAFFLES EVER!"
2046,2046,2046,2047,4,This lands in the gormet category for sure.  Having these pancakes is like going to a resturant and having exceptional pancakes that you would expect to get at home.  The price is a bit high but you know that before you buy them so its not fair to downgrade the product bnecause of that.<br /><br />They cook up nicely and one pack of two goes a long time.
2047,2047,2047,2048,5,"I use this as the base for my waffles.  Use 2 small bananas mashed, 3/4T cinammon, 1T vanilla, and 1/2 cup gratted pecans and then blend it all together.  You need to let it cook a much longer period of time at a lower then normal temperature and you need to cut back on the amount of water used. You need to know what the consistency of the waffle mixture should be before you attempt this recipe so that you can determine the amount of water to use.  This is a somewhat tricky recipe since it's easy for the waffles to stick and pull apart.  One banana makes it easier but I've had some success with three bananas.  Banana's are better overripe."
2048,2048,2048,2049,4,"I'm not normally a big fan of mixes but this is a great waffle mix.  It's quick, easy, and produces delicious waffles.  Yes, it's pricier than some of the other mixes on Amazon but I think it's worth it."
2049,2049,2049,2050,5,This is a great mix. I mixed it with milk instead of water.  Just follow the directions.
2050,2050,2050,2051,5,"This is my favorite waffle mix (it can be used to make pancakes too, but you have to add milk, and we don't usually have milk in the house).  You have to add water, 1 egg, and melted butter for the waffle recipe.  We eat waffles about once a week.<br /><br />Apart from the fact that it tastes great (it has a little vanilla and malt mixed in), it has NO trans fat.  Some pancake/waffle mixes, such as Krustead's which also tastes really good, say they have no trans fat PER SERVING, but if it has partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in the ingredients, there is still some (less than than 1 percent) trans fat per serving.  Stonewall has none.<br /><br />We used to have a store that sold it locally, but now we don't so I am glad we can get it online.<br /><br />The can comes with a recipe that is perfect for making two belgian waffles with no leftover batter.<br /><br />We just bought the regular mix but we are going to try the other flavors next."
2051,2051,2051,2052,5,"I originally received this mix as a gift from a friend in a gift pack.  When my family tried it as a gift they loved it immediately.  It is super yummy waffle mix.  The waffles turn out tasting so delicious you do not need to add any toppings or butter to them.  Here I am on amazon.com placing yet another order for this Waffle mix, it goes quickly around my house since it is now everyone's favorite breakfast item."
2052,2052,2052,2053,5,"We are into our third can of this flavorful and easy mix and it just seems to get better and better!  Sunday is pancake day at our house, and today we had blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup.  This mix holds fresh blueberries nicely - don't over-mix the ingredients and you will get nice, fluffy fruit-filled (or not) pancakes that are absolutely first-rate."
2053,2053,2053,2054,5,We first received Stonewall pancakes as a gift. We have ordered them 2x on Amazon who has the best prices. Highly recommend this product. Will return here to buy more...
2054,2054,2054,2055,5,"I bought this on a whim because I found some jam made by the same company and absolutely loved it. I didn't expect much more than basic waffle and pancake mix. This is so much better.<br /><br />It's easy to use and makes moist, fluffy pancakes that are to die for. I am never buying Bisquick again."
2055,2055,2055,2056,5,I have used this product for a few years now. This being the first time from Amazon. I'm glad it was there. This is by far the best pancake/waffle mix on the market bar NONE !
2056,2056,2056,2057,4,"The pancakes were delicious, but they weren't as fluffy as the ones I normally make.  Next time I use this, I'm going to whip the egg whites and see if that helps."
2057,2057,2057,2058,5,I found these at a super Gold Box pricing one day otherwise I would not have looked twice at 16.00 pancake mix.  Now we are hooked - nothing compares to this mix.  I've tried every box in the store for our belgian waffle maker and these top them all!<br />Waffles are nice and crisp on the outside and super soft on the inside. They are so dense they don't absorb syrup or toppings.  I will buy this over and over again.
2058,2058,2058,2059,4,"On a whim, I picked up a two-pack of Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix recently, enticed in some measure by the already positive reviews here--and I will add to those by noting that we will be keeping a supply on hand in our pantry.<br /><br />I really did not expect that this easy-to-prepare mix would yield waffles better than the from-scratch recipes I had been using, but now the waffle iron is stashed within easy reach after being banished to the recesses of the cabinets for the last few years.<br /><br />Being able to whip out crisp, airy, light, malty waffles does wonders for one's popularity in the kitchen, and pairing these with real maple syrup and fresh blueberries is the way to go."
2059,2059,2059,2060,4,"No matter how you mess up the recipe, this Mix still makes my family happy in the Sunday morning :)"
2060,2060,2060,2061,1,"I have an immense love for pancakes.  I have been on a search for the best pancake mix for about a year. I did not write this review prematurely as I wanted to give the product a fair chance.  I tried it with whole milk.  I tried it with buttermilk. I tried it with blueberries. I tried it without blueberries.  It is by far the WORST mix I have tried thus far.  The flavor is not good, seems like it needs more sugar.  With blueberries, it is very hard to get the pancakes to cook all the way through without overcooking them.  I really am telling you all the hype on this product has got to be from people that either work for the company lol or have never tried another high quality mix.  I honestly would rather eat pancakes from McDonalds.  Don't waste your money!  (Robbys mix is also wayyyyyyyyyy better and I believe it was cheaper). (may be better for waffles...since I'm stuck with two cans I may try that...ugh!)"
2061,2061,2061,2062,5,I hope Amazon restocks this item always.I can't stand the other brands out there since it got this brand.And the price is right at Amazon to.
2062,2062,2062,2063,3,The best thing about this pancake and waffle mix is the can in which it comes.  I really like the convenience of the can and the fact that it reseals easily.<br />The batter cooked up nicely and the texture was OK.  However I was very disappointed in the flavor.  There were stong overtones of chemical flavors.<br />I will be experimenting with my own recipes in the future.
2063,2063,2063,2064,4,"Heavily touted by the reviews, decided to try.  Mix is good, but not great.  Probably wouldn't buy again."
2064,2064,2064,2065,5,"This is the best pancake mix!  I've sent this to several people, and they all love it. The two-pack makes a nice little gift."
2065,2065,2065,2066,3,"Been curious about Stonewall since reading all the Amazon reviews but not sure about spending $$$ for a pancake mix.  The other day, found a big can at Sur La Tab store in San Francisco for only $10.95, so I thought, why not, this is my chance to try.  I was so looking fwd to Saturday morning and made it first thing today....all I can say is, underwhelming, nothing special.  I tried it following the instructions but using low fat milk and ""healthier"" butter, it was alright, but not great esp. considering the price.  Then I doctored it up a bit, added madagascar vanilla, flaxseed and psyllium which I usually do with my pancakes, tasted a bit better. Overall rating, 3 stars, just ok, stuck with the can so we'll eat it, but will not purchase again.  I will probably try it next time with full fat milk and butter as it recommended to see if that makes a difference, it probably does. I highly recommend Garvey's Organic Pancake Mix, also here in Amazon, tastes so much better and fluffier.  If you like 100% whole grain pancakes, we also love Kodiak Buttermilk mix, also here on Amazon...healthy, hearty and so good, even my kids love it...and best of all it's just add water, makes it portable, we even took it with us on vacay to Hawaii."
2066,2066,2066,2067,3,"When I read the reviews from other customers, I was excited about ordering and trying this mix. This morning we made waffles with both Stonewall Kitchen mix and Bisquick. The waffles from Stonewall were ok- and so were the waffles from Bisquick. The waffles were served to several people for tasting and everyone felt the same.<br /><br />The agreement was that Stonewall Kitchen product was not worth the significant extra cost. Furthermore, it is not available in our local super market whereas Bisquick is stocked. This will be a one time purchase for us."
2067,2067,2067,2068,3,I am constantly on the search for delicious buttermilk pancakes because they are my favorite food in the world.  I like to make my own or get them at the Original Pancake House (which has the best buttermilk pancakes I have ever tasted).  I decided to try this box mix variation even though I am not a fan of box mixes.  The Stonewall brand has a very aromatic scent but that's where I ceased to be impressed.  These pancakes hardly rise at all and have a decent flavor and texture but are nothing to gush over.  Then again I guess I'm one of the few who would gush over a plain bettermilk pancake anyway!!  They're ok but not worth all that money.
2068,2068,2068,2069,3,"Every week I make waffles or pancakes for my wife and daughter. Their opinion is that the waffles taste different from but not better than those I make with Jiffy mix. As Jiffy mix costs a lot less, I will not likely order this product again."
2069,2069,2069,2070,1,"This expensive pancake mix tastes so processed and fake.  A less expensive bisquick from your local grocery store beats the taste, no doubt.  It's a yucky product."
2070,2070,2070,2071,3,"This mix makes nice pancakes. They smell rich and vanilla-y, but you don't actually  taste it as strong as it smells. I won't buy them again because there are easier mixes out there that taste pretty darn close. I'm just as happy using a Krusteaz brand mix that only requires the addition of water (no eggs or milk or flour necessary). Heck, if you want that vanilla smell and taste, add an eighth or quarter teaspoon of some extract to your batter.<br /><br />Edited for grammar's sake."
2071,2071,2071,2072,5,"Recently, my life partner was complaining about our same ole breakfast every morning.  That is when I discovered that he ""loves"" pancakes. I was aware that he liked waffles. (We've only been together almost five years!)  I, on the other hand, have never cared for pancakes.  I loved my Gram's waffles, but nothing she did could tempt me to eat pancakes, no amount of butter or slathering with strawberry jam could make a difference. I just didn't care for PANCAKES!  She did insist on teaching me how to make and cook them, because my Daddy enjoyed pancakes, so I learned.<br />I was in Central Market on Saturday when I ran into a co-worker and her husband.  They took me by the hand from the Baking Products isle to the Jams, Jelly, Syrup, Honey isle.  On the top shelf was ""the very best pancake mix"":  Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix. I saw the price and took a deep breath, it was twice the price of the mix I had just been contemplating purchasing. On their recommendation, I tossed it in the cart along with some ""real"" organic, light amber, maple syrup.<br />This morning, I fixed three small (3 inch diameter) pancakes for my man and one for myself just to taste. I needed to know!<br />Well, I don't believe I have ever had real maple syrup before in my life, just that sugar processed krapola sold as pancake syrup. I have NEVER liked that stuff!<br />That pancake with a tiny dribble of real maple syrup was DELICIOUS! It was the pancake mix that made the difference.<br />Now I am reading reviews to purchase a waffle maker.  After tasting that light, fluffy pancake, I can hardly wait to have some waffles made from this mix.  These reviews are making my mouth water with anticipation!<br />I will never buy any thing else."
2072,2072,2072,2073,2,"This mix produced some pretty bland pancakes.  Followed the directions on the canister and the batter was pretty thin which in turn produced some pretty thin pancakes.  Considering the ingredients that needed to be added, it would have been just as easy to create my own buttermilk pancakes from scratch.  I debating trying to figure out how to jazz up the remaining canisters I have left (maybe some pumpkin pie spice) but that won't help the thicken up the batter."
2073,2073,2073,2074,5,"I'm not sure why, but this is our favorite pancake & waffle mix.  Just tastes the best to us."
2074,2074,2074,2075,2,"Makes OKAY pancakes. Only marginally better than the standard Bisquick recipe. They are edible (I should say that my kids liked them).<br /><br />Not that great, in my opinion."
2075,2075,2075,2076,2,We didn't care for this product at all. It seemed to have a funny after taste to it. Wasn't worth the cost. We were unable to even finish using what we purchased it was that nasty.
2076,2076,2076,2077,2,"What am I missing?<br /><br />This mix creates a pretty much tasteless pancake. I've tried adding vanilla and cinnamon. I use real maple syrup on top. I cook them in fresh bacon grease. The pancakes are still, just, blah. It's like they absorb and negate the flavors.<br /><br />The pancakes cook ok. The texture is fine. Just absolutely no flavor.<br /><br />Won't get this again. Considering pitching the rest of what I have."
2077,2077,2077,2078,3,"I bought the mix at the same time as the Oster 3874 waffle maker and have been pleased with the results: light, well baked waffles that tasted good.  My problems with the mix were first the expense, secondly that the mix is very finely ground and flies around when poured and there may some sort of perfume added to it.  It simply smells too good.<br /><br />I am happy with the product but will probably not reorder it."
2078,2078,2078,2079,5,I hope Amazon always carries this product too. I have ordered it twice. Excellent product for the price. Yum-O!
2079,2079,2079,2080,1,Part of me wants to ask for a refund. I bought this package of k cups because I wanted a mix of teas. When I got my package I was very disappointed to see hardly any teas in the package. I know they substituted based on availability but I think it's completely misleading to substitutes with products that don't pertain to the packaged theme. I got a mix of gingerbread and eggnog. DISAPPOINTING!
2080,2080,2080,2081,1,"This is NOT A SUMMER SAMPLER<br /><br />The majority of this Sampler was hot, including: Hot Eggnog, Hot Apple Cider, Hot Gingerbread Coffee, Hot Caramel Apple, and Golden French Toast Coffee<br /><br />Sound like ""the Perfect Brewed Over Ice K-Cup"" to you?  This was the totality of iced drinks: Vanilla Iced Coffee, Peach Iced Tea, and unsweetened black iced tea.<br /><br />Additionally, there were only 8 varieties rather than the 9 listed on the description.<br /><br />I literally thought they might have mixed my Summer drinks for Holiday drinks, but it was clearly labeled Summer Sampler.<br /><br />Even worse, this item does not generally qualify for a refund.  Beware!"
2081,2081,2081,2082,1,"Thought I was ordering summer tea flavors, got leftover winter garbage. I will not buy from this seller again. I HATE iced coffee, much less gingerbread and eggnog flavors! I cannot believe I just spent that amount of money on crap that I will not ever drink. Should have waited until Walmart carried it! Does Keurig know this stuff is being sold under such false advertisements? Yes, I know it says flavors may be substituted. That would be fine if they were more teas. If I had wanted gross iced coffee flavors, I would have ordered such!<br /><br />On the up side, the peach tea I received was very good. Otherwise, don't waste your money!"
2082,2082,2082,2083,1,I got two Teas and one type of iced coffe and the rest were HOLIDAY COFFEES and APPLE CIDER!  Spicy Eggnog? Gingerbread? Bait and swtich.  The only redeeming factor - Amazon was great and issued me a refund.
2083,2083,2083,2084,1,"There should be an option for a 0 star rating because that is what I would rate this item.<br />First, the sampling was to include 9 varieties but included only 7.  It appears that the two flavors out of stock were not substituted with two other flavors but instead a few more of the remaining flavors were tossed in the box. I had expected that when a limited edition coffee flavor such as Island Coconut was out of stock, it would be replaced with a different limited edition coffee flavor.  Same thing for the Half and Half Lemonade.<br />Second, the order was not balanced.  Of the 7 flavors I did receive, only 2 were coffees, the remaining 5 were teas.<br />The concept of a summer sampler set is a good one but the execution here was an epic fail.  The order is being returned today."
2084,2084,2084,2085,3,"We definately got a nice assortment of K-Cups but were really looking forward to trying the Peach tea which was not included in our shipment. I overlooked the line stating some flavors may be substituted but one of our substitutions was a hot coffee mix of Eggnog, French Toast, and a third winter type flavor. Slightly misleading from what is pictured."
2085,2085,2085,2086,3,"Don't get me wrong, I wanted to try the holiday sampler (mostly coffee) but I ordered the summer sampler with teas.  There were just a couple peach teas, sweet teas, and unsweetened black teas.  I didn't send it back because I wanted to try the holiday sampler.  Almost everything I got was the eggnog coffee, apple ciders, ginger bread coffee, and french toast coffee.  The box was labeled summer sampler, so I'm sure that this was an accident.  I didn't contact the seller because I ordered it while I was gearing up for finals and now there is no contact seller button.  So seller, if you see this review message me and we can talk."
2086,2086,2086,2087,1,"Really Amazon?! Nothing says delicious summer treat to me like a nice cup of EGG NOG... and when I am not craving Egg Nog in the summer, it's Gingerbread I'd really like... don't buy this, it sucks... I'm probably just going to toss it. If there was the ability to rate this with a negative number... I'd say -3"
2087,2087,2087,2088,1,"I do not consider Gingerbread, Spicy Eggnog, Caramel Apple Cider, Spiced Apple Cider summer items.... You cleaned off your self at my expense!  VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
2088,2088,2088,2089,2,"I was hoping for the gift box, instead I got a cardboard box full of a mixed bag of K cups.  Don't get me wrong, if the price is right then I have no problem, but the price was a little misleading.  I was under the impression that this would be in a sampler box, not a warehouse box.  It looks like a mix and match of K Cups that fell out of other packages or were returned. Buyer beware."
2089,2089,2089,2090,4,"As a new Keurig owner, I'm trying as many ""sampler"" packs as possible to determine what both my husband and I like the most.<br /><br />Although quite pricey and not coming in the cute gift box some other ""Crazy Cups"" purchases have been received in, I am enjoying this variety thoroughly.  It is almost entirely iced drinks and this sampler pack had a good mix of the following:<br /><br />Southern Sweet Tea, Unsweetened Black Tea, Raspberry Sweet Tea, Peach Sweet Tea, Sweet Lemon Tea, Half & Half Tea and a few different iced coffee k-cups.  Additionally, there were a few seasonal Island Coconut which my husband loves.<br /><br />I would consider purchasing variety packs as my main source of k-cups, but at a price of over 90 cents a cup I can't justify the cost.  However, this is a good starting point to narrow down some favorites to purchase in single flavor boxes!<br /><br />If these were presented in the gift boxes they use for other samplers, this would be a very ideal gift/house warming present for these hot summer months!  I don't mind them not being in a gift box, but I could have at least used that as an excuse to myself for the price."
2090,2090,2090,2091,3,The teas seem to brew really strong so use a large glass or dilute after... Unless you really like strong tea.<br /><br />It's a good pack to figure out which flavors you want to buy in bulk.
2091,2091,2091,2092,4,very good price and we love our keurig trying the summer flavors are great and will probably order more before the end of the summer.
2092,2092,2092,2093,4,"I haven't had a chance to try these out yet, but I thought I would go ahead and mention that I received 5 each of the following 7 flavors:<br /><br />- Sweet Rasberry Black Iced Tea<br />- Southern Sweet Iced Tea<br />- Sweet Lemon Iced Tea<br />- French Vanilla Iced Coffee<br />- Nantucket Blend Iced Coffee<br />- Gingerbread Coffee<br />- Eggnog Coffee<br /><br />Fortunately I'm okay with this, as I was wondering how the Gingerbread and Eggnog tasted as well. You might feel differently though, and might want to know since this seems to be the only variety pack of iced k-cups."
2093,2093,2093,2094,4,"There are some types I really like--especially Southern Sweet Tea (which is actually a lot less sweet than Southerners really make it).  The raspberry and peach are also good, and not overly sweet.  Urologist has banned artificial sweeteners from me as they do kidney damage.<br /><br />I did not care for the herbals, and thought there was a bit too much green tea in the assortment--but I found friends who like those flavors.<br /><br />It was to taste test, and it was fine for that.  I don't think I will buy assortments again, as I have found what I really like."
2094,2094,2094,2095,4,"I got this on a special and we are coffee lovers and like to try different kinds although Yuban is our everyday coffee. Well this was a surprise! Nice and flavorful, not bitter, smooth and maybe not as strong as Yuban in the same amounts the was all there. If they start selling this in lagers amounts for a better everyday price I would buy more but as is its very pricey."
2095,2095,2095,2096,3,i got a bag of these and the veggie sticks. haven't tried the veggie ones yet. the sweet potato didnt taste like sweet potato to me. just tasted like rice flour and cinnamon and brown sugar. tastes like that cereal cinnamon toast crunch. i put the the so called skinny sticks in a bowl and added milk. taste better!
2096,2096,2096,2097,5,"This was a new product to me.  They were very tasty, crisp, and surprisingly delicious.  I was very pleased with this product."
2097,2097,2097,2098,5,"I was very pleased to stumble upon this brand, as it is difficult to find ""healthy"" snacks for families that don't contain GMO ingredients. These were a big hit with kids and grown-ups alike; added bonus that they are low in calories and gluten-free. I would highly recommend the sweet potato flavor, as well as the brand in general. Great new company!"
2098,2098,2098,2099,5,"This product was a gift to a far distant relative.  It arrived right on schedule, in perfect condition and she loved the choices inside the basket.  I cannot attest to the food personally, but she loved it!"
2099,2099,2099,2100,5,"I always disliked soggy or soft crackers with my peanut butter.  And since I also had discovered I was allergic to wheat, I wanted and needed an alternative.  I originally found these Kame Rice Crunch crackers in Kroger supermarkets.  From the first bite, I loved them, and I wished I had discovered them years ago.  The plain variety has just the right amount of salt for taste, and they are perfectly crunchy and light.  I've occasionally had a hard time finding them, so I'm THRILLED that Amazon is now carrying them.  Give these a try, they are delicious!!"
2100,2100,2100,2101,5,These things are addicting and low in calories and fat too.  I love the Wasabi flavor.
2101,2101,2101,2102,5,I would recomend this product for it's fine qualities and taste really good. Very nice and crisp for any snack or with meals when you want to help on the lowering of carbohydrate intake.
2102,2102,2102,2103,5,"THESE CRACKERS ARE A GREAT SNACK! NO CHOLESTORAL, AND THEY USE SEA SALT. VERY CRUNCHY, SO ITS LIKE EATING POTATO CHIPS, BUT BETTER FOR YOU. COMES IN DIFFERENT FLAVORS, BUT I PREFER THE PLAIN. I HAVE FOUND THAT THE SALT CONTENT IS DIFFERENT ON SOME PURCHASES, SOMETIMES VERY SALTY AND SOMETIMES HARDLY ANY SALT, MUST BE A PROBLEM ON THE PRODUCTION LINE. THESE CRACKERS BECOME ADDICTING, BUT ITS OK CAUSE RICE IS GOOD FOR US!"
2103,2103,2103,2104,5,I'm so dissapointed these are unavailable right now! I LOVE these crackers with cream cheese - it's my favorite snack! I hope they become available again soon! I can't find them anywhere!
2104,2104,2104,2105,5,"I got 1 pack of these from my local grocery store and tasted them for the first time. To me, they taste just like corn nuts. They are quite hard, so I wouldn't recommend to anyone who doesn't like hard foods. They are crispy and delicious snacks tho. Will buy more. :D"
2105,2105,2105,2106,4,"This is an excellent product for the non-gluten diet.  They're good alone as a snack, or you can make a light meal with them by using these rice crackers as a base for spreads or little crispy sandwiches.  Excellent substitute for crackers containing gluten.  Only criticism - wish the price would come down."
2106,2106,2106,2107,4,"Not as good as Sesmark Savory Rice Minis, but these are available at least. They are VERY good. More healthy than potato chips and a bigger crunch. Mmmmmmmm . . ."
2107,2107,2107,2108,5,"First time buyer of KA-ME Rice Crackers and I'm very impressed. These are very light, crisp and flavorful. They are as good plain as they are with cold cuts, fruit, etc. Unfortunately, the ones I purchased may be the last I get from this source. Right after I purchased the dozen packs, the price per dozen increased 44% to its present $37.99. Fortunately, I have enough to last a while, but assuming the price stays the same, these are my last KA-ME."
2108,2108,2108,2109,5,"Crackers are great.  Was glad to find them. There is a good selection of flavors.  My favorite is salted, but there are other choices."
2109,2109,2109,2110,5,"Local availability of the Plain variety of these crackers has been unpredictable with stores trimming inventory and dropping all but the highest volume SKUs. Buying on subscription makes it affordable and, so far, reliable."
2110,2110,2110,2111,5,"These rice crackers are truly delicious w/cheese or Peanut butter.  Also I can eat crackers w/o Gluten. As I am allergic to wheat, eggs, Gluten, and Bannas.<br />This is my favorite snack on Sunday nights. They come promptly and save me money. Thank you. J. Wolf"
2111,2111,2111,2112,5,I love these crackers!  Perfect snack for when I need something salty/crunchy instead of potato chips or other greasy snack.  I eat them a lot to hold me over between meals.  The price on amazon is great compared to my local markets.  Highly recommended!
2112,2112,2112,2113,5,"Bottom line, these crackers are a great snack.  Ordering by the case saves some money compared to the $3.45 charged locally.  Whether plain, onion, or sesame (I've never tried the wasabi) these are a low fat, reasonable calorie snack eaten either plain or with something on it.  The only sad thing is that I first ordered them in 2008 for $21 per case."
2113,2113,2113,2114,1,"I ordered Ka-me rice crunch crackers, plain. I received Ka-me gluten-free rice crackers, original, all natural.  Unfortunately, they have soy products in this cracker and therefore I can't eat it.  This looks different from the picture that came with the crackers I ordered.  Apparently I can't return the box of crackers."
2114,2114,2114,2115,5,I too have begun to drink only Penta water unless absolutely neccessary to drink the other water.  I find that the price of the water is cheaper from the actual website [...] and I get free shipping.  I feel better overall and wish I could get this stuff by the gallon.  Great Product and well worth the price for the improved feeling of well being.
2115,2115,2115,2116,5,You can purchase this for $35.00 including free shpping straight from Penta's Website.<br /><br />I really enjoy drinking this. I can see a difference with my everyday life.
2116,2116,2116,2117,1,"you won't BELIEVE how many ways this product has saved my life!  I only gave it one star because i'm so dehydrated from drinking regular water all week because i ran out of money before my penta ran out.  when i can afford another shipment, i'll jack it back up to 5 STARS!<br />seriously, folks-- SOME waters just run through your system and you pee them all out right away.  not PENTA! it sticks to your ribs like oatmeal, restoring your body's natural tendencies to develop sympathetic electrolytic rehydration.  but it won't weigh you down!<br />other things i have noticed about this product:<br /><br />I accidentally dropped my cell phone into a glass of it, and when i pulled it out, it had better reception!<br />I was going to discipline my kids after they tried to clean my computer with it, until i discovered that it IMPROVED its functionality!<br />I threw some jumping beans into the bottle, and the next day i had a pair of baby pogo sticks growing in my refrigerator!<br /><br />hey, if you fill up your solar shower with this stuff, you won't even need soap.  it comes at a price, but it's so super!<br /><br />If you are tired with the uninvigorating, boring old swill other people call ""water"", or are lethargic from all that unenhanced blah that's so bad they can't attach a higher market value to, and you're so over the cheap, readily available and monitored CRAP your McBurbia proffers, then look no further."
2117,2117,2117,2118,5,"I bought bottles of this stuff because of its purity.  I have a VPI record washing machine to get the gunk out of the grooves in my record collection.  You basically scrub the records and vacuum the glop off using a mix of water and detergent.  This water is so pure it ever sinks deeper in the grooves and is a visably better penetrating fluid compared to distilled water much less tap (OH NO!) water with all its impurities.  You wouldn't believe how great my records play once they are deep cleaned.  My wife can always tell when I am playing vinyl instead of a CD ""It just sounds more alive""---she says.  This water is highly recommended for this purpose.  I may even drink some of it sometime to see what all the fuss is about."
2118,2118,2118,2119,5,"I love this water.  It is very uplifting.  I feel better drinking it.  It is arsenic free, flouride free, chromium 6 free, chlorine free,and mtbe free-something about reverse osmosis and medicinal grade oxygen really works.  At work, we are no longer allowed to drink soda in our classrooms, so I bought some Penta water. I am hooked.  I like the one liter size bottles.  I wish you would sell those also!  I was lucky to purchase this at Dorthy Lane Market!  Buy this water!"
2119,2119,2119,2120,1,"The site doesn't list the ingredients for their products online.  Had I known the product was full of trans fats I would not have ordered it.  Watch your labels.  Partially hydrated = partially hydrogenated.  You have to laugh at the ways manufacturers will try to fool the public.  In the future I will not order a product that doesn't list its ingredients online so that consumers can make informed purchases.<br /><br />Did try the product and found it tasteless.  No heat/spice and it left a waxy film on the roof of the mouth, must be from the wax.  I was going to send it to my son in college but tossed it in the trash instead.  The sad thing is that they do NOT have to use trans fats to get flavor.  They just don't care."
2120,2120,2120,2121,3,"I first tried these in a bundle of other gluten-free products, and it was so fresh. So I decided to buy it in bulk, and the expiration date was only three months. I ended up given most of it away because I didn't have time to eat all of the 12 packages I received. The taste is ok, not too sweet, but I found myself getting sick of it fast."
2121,2121,2121,2122,5,"These are my most favorite nut snacks. Sunflower is my absolute favorite, but the almond, cashew (very buttery and rich), and seasame are really great, too.  Have given as gifts and everyone follows up to ask me where they can buy them.  Great for the kiddos, too!"
2122,2122,2122,2123,5,I love this candy and ate it a lot as a kid. It has been very hard to find in any stores. I am so glad I found it on Amazon. The shipping was fast and the product arrived in excellent condition. It still has the same flavor after all of these years. Try this candy if you love coconut. You will love it too!
2123,2123,2123,2124,4,"This freeze dried ice cream is great! It tastes exactly like the more expensive kind with the astronaut on the package, for a fraction of the price. After receiving this, I understand why it costs less than the ""astronaut"" kind. The packaging stinks on ice.<br /><br />Normally, freeze dried items are packaged in air tight, foil type packages, so as to not permit light, and most importantly, air into the package. Air is the enemy of freeze dried items, because it contains moisture. The product arrives it is in an air tight can, which you need to open with a can opener. Inside, the individual servings of ice cream are in paper wrappers that will NOT keep air out of the product.<br /><br />It gets worse. The paper wrappers are not only NOT air tight, but they are also ALL slit open. Every serving is slit open in several places. The can says to transfer the servings into a ziplock bag and get as much air out as possible. This may or may not keep the product fresh, but doing so is better than leaving the ice cream in the can.<br /><br />With mine, I got as much air out of the bag as I could, by closing the bag as much as possible around a straw. I then sucked the air out until I could get no more air out, then slipped the straw out, whilst closing the bag in one swift motion. You MUST do this every time you open the bag to retrieve a serving, or air will ruin the delightful texture of the ice cream. So be prepared with large ziplock bags and a straw if you order this product."
2124,2124,2124,2125,5,"My 17 month old can easily eat the whole can in one day if I'd let him. He LOVES these puffs! He just munches on them like they are chocolate (or something that one really loves!). I just lay a bunch on his little table and he will just pick them up so fast and as soon as he is done he'll start whining for more. He does not do that with any other snack! It's insane! I have tried them and I must confess they are good, but can get expensive if baby gets addicted to them. I obviously buy these in bulk. We've only tried the carrot/cheese... I think the other flavor because of the green color may confuse him but I will try those as well as soon as we are done with this pack!"
2125,2125,2125,2126,5,"I purchased these for our 10 month old twins a while back and they absolutely loved them. They are now 13 months and still love them. They prefer them over the HappyMelts, even though they like those as well. Below is my pro/cons list:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Both babies love them<br />They are overall healthy, have less sodium, etc than other products of the same type of snack<br />A lot of munchies in each container<br />Great price on Amazon with Subscribe & Save<br /><br />Cons:<br />They are messy as they easily crumble and there are a lot of tiny crumbles in the bottom of the container<br />This particular flavor is sort of flavorless to me, however, my twins seem to disagree with my taste buds"
2126,2126,2126,2127,5,"I am a mom of 3 kids. With my older two I had such a hard time finding a snack for them that didn't have so much sodium! When my 3rd came along, HappyFamily introduced HappyMunchies. I was so thankful to find a snack low in sodium and with a vegetable too! And to top it off, it is organic so I know it is free of pesticide residue and GMOs!"
2127,2127,2127,2128,5,Baby loves to feed herself and these are a great on the go option. We have tried other brands (Gerber) but this is her favorite by far and I don't feel bad giving them to her as I know that they are high quality. Hubby tries to steal a few away here and there as well :)
2128,2128,2128,2129,5,"I've bought them many times. Good quality and good taste, baby love it, and I love it too. Reccommend it."
2129,2129,2129,2130,2,"I bought this because it's organic cheese puff. My son love Gerber cheese Lil' Crunchies. I thought he may like this too. I subscribe it once a month. Now there is 4 cans not open. The idea of mixing cheese and carrot is great, but there is no taste for this cheese snack. There is no cheese flavor in the puff. My son opened the can and keeps giving the puff to me. My son love Happybaby's yogurt melts, beef stew, happy baby banana beet blueberry and Spinach, Mango and Pear. This cheese puff does not work for him."
2130,2130,2130,2131,5,"While I worry that I am teaching my baby to be a snacker, these are perfect for the in-between times for my 1 year old grazer. The label tells me that they are a healthier choice for my baby than the typical grocery store aisle alternative. I like to keep these in the car and diaper bag for helping to calm my little one while waiting for meal, etc. I don't think they taste awesome, but he sure eats them like they are going to disappear. That makes me happy!"
2131,2131,2131,2132,5,"We love these. The cheddar carrot flavor is far better than the green flavor. My daughter, age 2, likes them both, but because we snack on them in the car I opt for the cheddar carrot which is tasty to me too. I love that they are healthy and I can feel great about giving her these instead of some brightly colored mystery things. Love em"
2132,2132,2132,2133,5,"My two boys love the Happy Munchies Cheddar Cheese/Carrot. They request them as their snack as they watch their ""show"" on t.v. I love that they are low in sodium, includes 25mg of choline per serving (which is great for their eyes)and tastes great. Also, they are Kosher certified which is a plus as well. I love to put these in baggies and keep them in my purse for emergency snacks on the go. Healthy, crunchy and a must buy."
2133,2133,2133,2134,4,"My 1 year old son does really like these- andthey certainly taste better than some of the other finger food snacks.  The only issue is there are lots of crumbs in the can they come in, so it gets messy if you want to dump them into a baggie for on the go."
2134,2134,2134,2135,5,These are a great alternative to chips.  I wasn't sure how they would be based on other reviews but I am glad I bought them and wish I would of found them sooner.  I have twin 18 month olds and they can't get enough of them.  I like them too!
2135,2135,2135,2136,5,"My son is only 9mo, so he can't say it yet, but he LOVES these.  He gets excited when I even take them out of the pantry!! I like the fact that they are organic and also have carrots."
2136,2136,2136,2137,5,My son loves them and I can give them to him knowing they melt in his mouth so won't choke and they are good for him too.
2137,2137,2137,2138,3,"The title of my review says it all (as long as it didn't get cut off). These have a lot more air in them than the Gerber Little Crunchies. These crush extremely easily and get dust/crumbs all over the place. Also, they do not taste nearly as good as the Gerber Little Crunchies. They might be better for you, and I like that it has a hint of veggies in it, but my 17 month old isn't very happy with them. She'll snack on them if that's her only option and she's really hungry, but she definitely will not choose them. We first got these several months ago and she's had the same reaction to them every time since then."
2138,2138,2138,2139,5,"Happybaby Happymunchies Baked Organic Cheese and Veggie Snack, Cheddar Cheese/Carrot, 1.63 Ounces (Pack Of 6)<br /><br />Hello, this is six items should be installed, but I only received a, I with amazon contact but nobody reason I, please verify as soon as possible, give me reissue, thank you!!!!"
2139,2139,2139,2140,5,"I purchased this at my local health food store and I am enjoying it immensely.  The juice has a nice, robust texture, and it is not overly salty. The flavor is amazingly fresh and refreshing.<br />I combine it with Odwalla flash-pasteurized 100% carrot juice for a well-above-average vegetable juice that is a good energy-booster and makes for a great alternative to orange juice or other sweet juices.<br />Enjoy!"
2140,2140,2140,2141,5,"We love these baby food things in a little pouch. Sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go. Our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added - just fruit. For smaller ones, not good to let them handle it themselves, because they love to squeeze it, which gets things everywhere. But older ones can feed to themselves. I like the 3.17 size rather than the bigger one that Plum Organics has for some of the other flavors. It assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later. You can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives - not the case with the bigger pouches. I also like that it is BPA free. If your little one likes them, ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store."
2141,2141,2141,2142,3,"I really wanted my kids to love it: these are very convenient on the go and should be delicious... or so it seemed. Unfortunately, none of the kids cared for it -- it tastes like stage 1 baby food (very bland) and is very runny too, so it can get quite messy if you squeeze a little too hard or if the child drops it."
2142,2142,2142,2143,5,"I discovered these when my daughter was about 15 months old. I wish I had found them earlier. They are organic, taste great, are easy for toddlers to handle and very convenient! I always keep some in my purse and in the car when we're out and about. They are not messy, unless of course they decide to squeeze the pouch, which only happens for us when she's not hungry.<br /><br />The Plum Organics line also includes some varieties with fruits and vegetables mixed together. They taste surprisingly good and are one way to get my picky eater to eat some veggies. You can find some varieties at reasonable prices on Amazon, others are more expensive for some reason. Babies R Us has had a sale every other month or so where you can get them for $1 each if you buy them in sets of 8. That is usually when I stock up for the next two months. :)"
2143,2143,2143,2144,5,"My daughter will start school this fall and i was concerned about lunches and fruit-to-go choices. We've bought several different fruit pouches at a local organic store and she and I loved these the most. It it not overly sweet (and a strawberry variation as well), tastes really good. She can easily eat 2 of these every day.<br />I really like the fact that it has no sugar and color added + it is organic. Just fruit puree.<br /><br />I, personally, don't like banana variation, but it's just because of my own personal preferences (i like fresh bananas more than cooked), other than that, my daughter approved all of flavors to 10 stars."
2144,2144,2144,2145,5,"Plum products are such a wonderful and yummy idea for the toddler, heck even the adult from time to time. I keep a full stock of every flavor fruit pouch Plum makes for toddlers. They make a great snack to throw in the diaper bag or back pack, whether you are packing a for a trip to the store, school lunches or going to Disneyland! These pouches have saved the day many many times. I have even grabbed one or two to add to my lunch when no other fruit was available for me, and it was really good! I have and will always recommend Plum to every parent I know!"
2145,2145,2145,2146,5,I love Plum organic pouch.  Got this one on sale.  My baby and toddler LOVE this so much.  My 3 years old always ask me for more.
2146,2146,2146,2147,5,My son loves these and they are great to throw in your diaper bag or take with on trips.  A lot of time I can't find fresh fruit while we are out and about that my son (he is 1) can eat.  These are great because it is actual fruit and he can eat it straight from the pouch.  Just make sure you help them the first couple of times or else you might have a bit of a mess.
2147,2147,2147,2148,5,"Have had other brands like this before, and have always enjoyed them.  These were a really good bargain on sale."
2148,2148,2148,2149,5,My 8 month old loves this & has no problem holding it & sucking the food out.  This is great for on the go!
2149,2149,2149,2150,5,this makes feeding on the go so easy! my one-year-old will suck down a pouch in 5 minutes and she loves them!
2150,2150,2150,2151,5,"I bought this for my 15 month old son who has become a very picky eater as of late.  I wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and veggie servings each day.  This does the trick!  He loves them and he can feed himself.  What more can I say?  (Oh, I actually tried one, and they really are good!)"
2151,2151,2151,2152,5,"I tried this product because it was a ""Friday Special"" and it caught my eye it being 100% fruit and 100% organic.  I don't have any children, but this looked interesting to try because I've been trying to eat healthier and sometimes it's hard to get my recommended amount of fruit servings a day.  I buy fruit but it always seems to go bad before I can eat it all.  I bought the banana mish mash also, and really like it, too.  I like to add it to my oatmeal, or spread it on top of my peanut butter toast, or just by itself!  To clarify the ingredients- it has 3 different fruits, not just peach and not just banana.  Obviously, I'm ok with this...just wanted to throw that out there.  There are multiple things I love about this product.  Here goes.. and not in any particular order...<br />1) Easy to open, convenient, resealable pouch<br />2) It tastes great!<br />3) All natural, 100% fruit...no nasty preservatives or chemicals<br />4) 100% organic<br />5) Great for everyone, not just babies.<br />6) The price is good compared with other similar products, and I love the free shipping!"
2152,2152,2152,2153,5,Not as tasty as the strawberry but still very nice. Great to throw in a diaper bag or purse. Spendy but definitely a good deal when it's on sale.
2153,2153,2153,2154,5,These are awesome and if you know where to find the discount codes they can be super inexpensive.  I love the all natural ingrediants and I actually find them to taste great.  I actually put a little in my older kids oatmeal and they love it too.  I make 90% of my daughters baby food but this great for on the go or as a supplement.<br /><br />My twin niece and nephew who are 18 months old love these as a snack and my sister says they are so great for car rides or trips to the museum.  I highly recommend these over any other baby food product.
2154,2154,2154,2155,5,"this is perfect for babies and toddlers on the go! we started using the baby version when my daughter was an infant--it is so easy to throw a pouch and a baby spoon into the diaper bag. now that my daughter is older, she is able to feed herself with the pouch. just give your toddler the pouch and they will squeeze/suck the fruit out of it. not only is the packaging great, but the fruit tastes good as well (and yes, I have tasted everything that I feed my daughter). my daughter loves this--her whole face lights up when I hand her a pouch."
2155,2155,2155,2156,3,"I know these are super trendy right now, and I totally wanted to love this product (or, to be more exact, I wanted my toddler to love this product). He took one taste, handed it back to me, and said, ""Why you gave me baby food, mom?"" I tasted it, and he is right. It tastes just like jarred baby food. Same consistency (not any thicker), too. If your kid likes the packaging, great. If your kid doesn't, then it is just really, really expensive baby food. I'm going to give the rest to my baby, as the toddler is not the least bit interested."
2156,2156,2156,2157,5,"Well, maybe I'm the first one to review this wonderful treat, but I know I'm not the first one having tried them! This treat is so safe, healthy, and yummy! In my native language, Miam-Miam is for Yum-Yum!<br />There you go. Not too sweet, yet not lacking sweetness. You can't taste one ingredient above the other one (OK, besides the coconut, since it's mostly made of it), it's so good.<br /><br />This is a raw food product that has been dehydrated at low temps, it's really nice to give to our kids. (We have 7 of them, and they love it). Of course it's a bit more expensive than your average treats/candies, but hey, who wants to complain?<br /><br />Do you want crappy candies with dyes, chemicals and cooked (so basically poison), or you want to give REAL FOOD for yourself and your kids?<br /><br />I bet if people learn to do/prepare these treats and give that to their kids, school would be less filled with Asperger Syndromes, ADD, ADHD kids etc....<br /><br />This is a treat that you won't regret having spent money on it, unless of course... you are so used to the chemical loaded-pesticide-herbicide-overly cooked-High Fructose Corn Syrup-dyed candy, then it's not for you.<br /><br />Keep your money instead, you'll need it for the bills you'll have when you go to the numerous Docs that can't help you and your kids. Sorry....:("
2157,2157,2157,2158,1,This flavor is awful! We absolutely love all the other flavors but goji cacao & maca is really difficult to get down. I give all the other flavors 5 stars!
2158,2158,2158,2159,5,"Delicious and nutritious! We live for coconut and nut treats since we don't eat grains. When I want to splurge, I pick up a bag of these from Whole Foods or my local indie health store. They average around $10 here unless they're on sale. :) I'd looove to be able to buy these in bulk. YUM YUM!"
2159,2159,2159,2160,1,"We have been feeding this to our dogs for over a year.  Over the past few months, we have had a problem with the cases of Grammy's Pot Pie cans.  Some cans were full of chunks of fat and a thick lard-like gravy with no veggies, and some cases were fine with chicken and veggies,etc. What happened to truth in labeling?  We also had the problem with the cans being only half-full sometimes. Our dogs were getting bad diarhea from the fat in the food so we had to stop giving them Merrick.<br />  They need to start testing their food again.  It used to be great.  Look at the old reviews from last year and before."
2160,2160,2160,2161,3,"I've been feeding this wet food to my dogs for 3 years, and as my husband has said ""if you through it in a crock pot and served it to me for dinner i would have no idea it was dog food."" But i am a little upset with the fact that the cans aren't full. In this last case some were even only half full. I have 4 dogs and this stuff isn't cheap."
2161,2161,2161,2162,1,"Please think twice about purchasing this product, especially if you have a small-breed dog. I was lured by the cute, gimmicky labeling and sold by the ingredient list, but I twice fed Merrick canned food to both of my dogs, and BOTH times, BOTH dogs were diagnosed with pancreatitis -- an illness which is dangerous,  extremely painful to the animal, and which requires hospitalization. I'm not sure if the fat content in those particular cans was high, or if Merrick uses an ingredient/additive that somehow sickened both of my (unrelated) dogs, but this food made them very ill. After their second hospitalization for pancreatitis, I spoke with other folks who had stopped feeding Merrick to their small-breed dogs for the same reason -- the food caused vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy in their pets."
2162,2162,2162,2163,5,I am just passing along the 5-star rating from our three Miniature Schnauzers. This stuff is a big hit at our house. We give them each an easy to digest kibble that's good for them and put a tablespoon of Pot Pie on top. No more turned up noses now - they wolf it all down. Be sure to mix it up real good before serving.
2163,2163,2163,2164,5,"I just switched from Merrick Whole Earth brand pate style to this upgraded line by Merrick and my dog loves it!  This a great for dogs that like ""human"" food."
2164,2164,2164,2165,5,"We adopted an 8-year-old Dalmatian earlier this year, and heard lots of cautionary tales about special diet. But we couldn't pass up trying a can of this dog food--sadly, just because of the name. Well, she loves it! So now it's her special occasion food. We mix half a can with a cup of dry, 2X/day, with no nasty side effects. She also likes Wingaling and the Napa Valley offerings from this company. It's high in protein and works for us!"
2165,2165,2165,2166,5,"so happy we found this online for a reasonable price.  my two dogs love this stuff and it doesn't upset their stomachs.  Plus I love that it's not made in china or something.  when you look at the food, it looks pretty close to people food. You can see real chunks of chicken and veggies.  I don't want to give my dogs any manufactured stuff but also don't have the time to make our own dog food."
2166,2166,2166,2167,5,I give Merrick canned food as a treat and mix it to my dog's dry kibble (and the cat even gets a taste) every now and then.  The Chicken Pot Pie smells better than any human chicken pot pie I can remember.
2167,2167,2167,2168,4,"My dog thinks he was born into the gentry and is entitled to fine dining each evening.  Accordingly, he will not eat plain kibble.  A scoop of this on his dry food, a little water to make gravy and we're good to go.  Ordering a case from Amazon was way easier than picking up individual cans at the pet store, too.  All in all, a success for us."
2168,2168,2168,2169,5,"I switched to Merrick dog food several years ago (2007) when all the dog food seemed to be tainted with the rat poison - specificlly Aminopterin - and was getting worse by the day.<br /><br />My dog is my life and I would have been devastated to know I had fed her something that would have caused the suffering and anguished death and illness that many of these pets had been forced to endure. So, I started to look around and found it appalling that there was such little oversight in pet food manufacture and control regarding ingredients and labelling. I knew that it was NOT natural for dogs who had been carnivores for thousands of years to be eating all this processed ""scrap"" and bonemeal - no matter how the companies tried to ""re-label"" it. I also though, knew how critical it was for animals to get critical micro-nutrients in appropriately balanced levels and it could be equally devastating for someone uneducated in animal nutrition to think that they could just 'home-cook' meals which could leave gaping holes in these essential minerals, vitamins and micro-nutrients; not to mention the ratios of fats, oils, proteins that the animals need. So, I was searching for a company I could TRUST!<br /><br />I found Merrick and have not turned back! We have never been happier and use both Grammy Pot Pie Kibble as well as some of these canned dog food cans - though since 'we' are a small dog we use the ""smaller"" sized cans (cat food sized 5.5oz) The cans are ironically enough - filled with ingredients that you can read and UNDERSTAND. You can also go to their website and find out what any ingredient that may sound 'foreign' really is and why they used it - I found out they were almost always a natural ingredient that is an alternative to a processed chemical. I also found it comforting that particularly with the canned food I could open it and RECOGNIZE ingredients like a potato looking like a suprise, POTATO! Or a pea, carrot, etc. My dog LOVES this merrick food and has never been healthier! Our vet constantly comments on her blood work levels coming back at ""perfect levels"" and she is almost 9. Her coat is really healthy and probably what is noticed by most pet owners and yet not the most 'pleasant' aspect to discuss, is that she has almost NO gas (I don't give her much if any people food either) but when she is given other brands she can be really hard to sit near on ocassion :) . I think the phrase you get out what you put in applies here as well... I will not switch from Merrick food - ever! My only regret is that I did not start feeding my little four-legged one Merrick sooner!"
2169,2169,2169,2170,1,"I had heard this was wonderful canned food, so I tried it for my very fussy schnauzer. I was first surprised to see a layer of fat on the top when I opened the can....I scraped that off and added a couple spoonfuls to her dry....and she sniffed it and walked away. She does seem to like the Merrick BG dry food. I chose the buffalo flavor and my girl says this is a winner."
2170,2170,2170,2171,3,"My little Lhasa Apso mix was diagnosed with diabetes a couple of months ago, so I found Merrick's Grammy's Pot Pie to be low glycemic, and decided to try it. He loves this food! It has chunks of potatoes, carrots, and peas, not to mention chicken and apples. The only downside about ordering it from Amazon is the delivery method. The day the food was delivered, a van pulled up in front of my house and left the 5 cases of food I had ordered outside of my chain link fence next to the mailbox. Needless to say, someone could have taken it if I hadn't seen the delivery woman drop it off. I'm also disabled, and if it hadn't been for my next-door neighbor being outside at the time, I couldn't have gotten the cases of food into my house without her help. Many of the cans were also extremely dented. Delivering items this way is not acceptable. I would have given this review 5 stars if it hadn't been for the delivery."
2171,2171,2171,2172,1,"I have a special needs pet and searched for the right food.  Since Amazon has been a five star resource I chose to have Pot Pie shipped. Many of the cans are dented.  So I have to toss them or return. This is a big hassle but would not ever feed a dented can to my beloved boy.  Best to purchase at the pet store, evidently."
2172,2172,2172,2173,5,This canned food has real chunks of chicken in it.  Dogs love it.  Looks and smells better than human-quality canned beef stew (like Dinty Moore).
2173,2173,2173,2174,4,"Watch out for the fat-- 9g of fat per 17g serving.<br /><br />I guess I knew that nuts have high fat but somehow I was stuck on the ""100 Calories...""<br />The flavor of these is delicious.

2174,2174,2174,2175,5,Now let me start by saying I did not buy this tea as a diet supplement. I bought this because I tried it from a local store as I was looking for a tea that had some peppermint in it but not so much it was over-powering like a full peppermint tea. This has just the right amount of peppermint combined with a green tea. Overall it is a pleasant taste that I could drink all day.
2175,2175,2175,2176,4,This tea is very good.  I discovered it while visiting in California. The moment I got home I searched local stores for it and I was not able to find it.  Finally I decided to see if Amazon had it and they did and I bought two boxes.  As long as they make it I will buy it.
2176,2176,2176,2177,5,"The tea tastes great and helped me curb cravings during dieting. The tea was inexpensive and came packaged in a pretty box. The bags are flimsy, but I just throw the bag in a tea ball with no worries. I will continue to keep this on hand as part of my tea collection."
2177,2177,2177,2178,4,I love this TEA. It has a very smooth taste and not bitter like other kind of tea. I do agree that the string seems to come apart easily but I can live with that. No big deal! The quality of TEA makes up for that.
2178,2178,2178,2179,4,"I found this exact same stuff at the dollar store.  It is pretty good.  Not as good or as strong as my loose whole leaf tea, but for the price it can't be beat. Bags are never as good as loose leaf.  I use it if I want one quick cup.  I steep my loose leaf tea 2-3 times, so I have to have time to drink 2-3 cups.  I gave this 4 stars because it is a good deal for the money purchased from the dollar store. If I make myself a mug, and because it is cheap, I use 2 bags.  I would have been disappointed if I had paid the original price on here for it though."
2179,2179,2179,2180,2,I ordered through source in the past and cancelled my membership due to the excessive charges every month. I was happy to look on amazon and find that I could purchase for much cheaper and use my prime account. This tea IS NOT THE SAME AS THE ONE THAT CAME IN THE BLACK BOX..The orignal tea is brown and this tea is green...the pamphlet is the same inside as the other and the fragile tea bags are the same but the tea is different. This one comes packaged much preetier but it does not taste the same. I have lost 20 pounds in the last 2 months by drinking this tea in the morning and only water throughout the day that is my only diet change. I used the other tea for a month and half and this new tea for 3 weeks now.. I dont want to stop taking the tea just is in case it is the contributor to my weight loss. The next order I will try the other tea that you have to pay for shipping on. I hope I can find this orginal stuff because this is not it.
2180,2180,2180,2181,5,"Not much else to say... I keep a box in my desk here at work, and I can enjoy a cup anytime!  Nice flavor, and no bitterness, so I can drink it straight without sugar!<br /><br />Pros:  Flavor and value.<br /><br />Cons:  It can't do my taxes for me... that's really about all I can think of.  lol"
2181,2181,2181,2182,4,"I got tired of overpaying for tea at Teavana so decided to try this brand of Oolong tea and was pleasantly surprised. It has a wonderful flavor and like the previous reviewer, I just put the bag in a tea ball to compensate for the poor quality of the bags. You just can't beat the value of this tea!"
2182,2182,2182,2183,5,"this is a high quality oolong tea and i can't go back to bigelow, that's for sure! the taste is great, it is said to have slimming benefits, and the tea bags are a higher quality that don't come apart easily."
2183,2183,2183,2184,5,I got two bags from my friend who got it from his friend who said it was primo. So I chucked them in a zip-lock when I got home. 3 mos. later I opened it and had some today. I am online trying to find more.
2184,2184,2184,2185,3,"so far, nothing extremely impressive. the taste to be honest isn't anything special (i've had MUCH better) and for the price you get what you pay for. a bit annoyed that the string is super cheap and always falls off but it came nicely packaged and arrived MUCH faster than i expected (by like 5 days) so i suppose that's a plus. all in all, if you're looking for something extravagant, keep looking. as for the 'benefits', haven't really noticed anything new... but i'll keep drinking for a couple weeks and see how that goes, then update my review... till then, yeah maybe i should i invested in something else (but since it was barely any money i guess i didn't do too bad).."
2185,2185,2185,2186,2,"Just got my teabags today, and the first bag I made tea with... the part of the teabag where the string is connected to the bag tore across the bag after seeping.  The bag remained intact though. The second bag, while unwrapping the teabag... the tag ripped the bag right open.<br /><br />The tea tasted fine, not very strong like most other oolong teas.  The quality of the tea bag is like some flimsy material.  Two out of two broke... I guess I need to be more careful with the others."
2186,2186,2186,2187,5,"You just can't beat the taste of the original Dubble Bubble Gumballs! It really doesn't matter that the taste only last a minute or so, but that is why I bought the tub! The  tub by the way is very convenient  and was shipped to me in A+++ condition! If your longing for the classic taste go for it! You will not be dissappointed!"
2187,2187,2187,2188,2,"Holy cow!  I have never seen this much grease in a boxed product like this!  Also, it has enough salt to kill an entire family of slugs!  Use it in your garden, don't eat it!"
2188,2188,2188,2189,4,"Using the entire sauce packet is over kill, leaving a salty greasy puddle at the bottom of the carton. Otherwise noodles are well made, and sauce is reasonably well flavored. Quick and easy, a no brainer."
2189,2189,2189,2190,1,"I had high hopes for this product when I first opened the package because the noodles had a great texture and the sauce looked appealing.  The food was easy to prepare at my workplace.  However to me, the taste was very oily and flavorless.  I'm a big peanut satay fan and was expected more spice in the flavor."
2190,2190,2190,2191,4,"This is pretty good stuff. You can't expect a whole lot from instant box-o-noodles, but this is the best out of all the other brands I've tried before. The noodles have good constancy and the peanut sauce is really tasty as well. I'm going to buy more."
2191,2191,2191,2192,4,"""It tastes better than it looks"" was the first thing I said the a skeptical co-worker looking at my peanut satay as it came out of the microwave.  Unfortunately, it's as fattening as it looks, so I likely won't be purchasing it often.  I could see this mixing with chicken or beef and tasting even better though!"
2192,2192,2192,2193,4,"while its not traditional satay  it is very good the oil is ok cause without it it would be too dry, i had some of these that were a year and a half old i made it and it was fine, i will buy again"
2193,2193,2193,2194,1,"I love peanut satay.  This product is truly terrible.  In no way does it resemble that dish.  Oily, salty and tastes lousy.  Don't waste your money on this brand."
2194,2194,2194,2195,4,"I adore this brand of peanut satay noodles.  Unlike the other ethnic-foods-in-box, Ka-Me's noodles and sauces are flavorful and delicious.  However, there's certainly a downside.  This dish is greasy, fattening, and high in calories.  If you read the nutritional information, you'll find that this tiny box contains two servings that are high in fat and not very filling.<br /><br />My advice?  Split this dish with a friend and serve with a small serving of rice.  The sauce is flavorful and potent enough that it bleeds into the rice.  An instant and tasty multi-dish meal!"
2195,2195,2195,2196,3,"This is NOT real peanut satay but for the price it is not bad. I like to get these and keep them in my desk at work for the days that I don't have time to go out to lunch. These are really easy to make; just mix together the cooked noodles and the bag of sauce and microwave for about 2 minutes. You will not get a restaurant quality meal out of this but it is decent for just over $2.00 a box. The box says it is 2 servings but if you are not mixing in any meat or anything, it really is only 1 serving."
2196,2196,2196,2197,4,"A nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market stocks a number of gourmet imported products and I enjoy trying them. One is a variety of Baxters soups from Canada. Today, I had the Butternut Squash and Red Pepper Soup. Quite good. Smooth and mellow. Mild taste, but delicious. Goes down real easy and it only comes to 90 calories per serving (2 servings per can). Alas, the sodium content is a bit higher than I like. Otherwise, very good.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
2197,2197,2197,2198,5,I have been using this product for years and was happy to find it on line since our local place (Bristol Farms) had closed.  I love it especially in my salad dressings.
2198,2198,2198,2199,5,"The pomegranate molasses arrived on time and in good condition.  I encountered this as an ingredient in a Mollie Katzan cookbook and it did not disappoint.  We thinned it just a little with warm water and used it as a side sauce for roasted asparagus at a barbecue, and got many rave reviews from our guests, vegetarian and non-vegetarian alike.  I recommend both the vendor and this item."
2199,2199,2199,2200,5,"Fast, professional transaction.  I needed this one ingredient for a new recipe and it turned out great!  Now I just need to find more uses for this stuff."
2200,2200,2200,2201,4,Only Pom.Mol.I've ever used but this seemed to have the same flavor the Chef came up with for a pomegranate relish for fish. It seems to have a bit of a brown appearance though where the one the Chef used was a brighter red color.
2201,2201,2201,2202,5,"I have two recipes I'm anxious to try that call for pomegranate molasses. I've called all the specialty and best markets in the Sacramento area and no one's heard of this, much less carries it.  It's common in Mediterranean recipes, goes with shrimp, fish, chicken, beef and pork. I was delighted to find it on Amazon and look forward to using mine in a fabulous short ribs recipe.  I'm also passing along the info to my friends so they can order their own -- or I may give as gifts to my gourmet cook friends."
2202,2202,2202,2203,5,I would recommend this product.  I received it in a timely manner and the price was good.
2203,2203,2203,2204,5,"Pomegranate molasses is my mother's ""secret"" recipe for great meatballs. She adds a couple teaspoon of molasses to the meat and the taste comes out incredible.<br /><br />Once I set-up my own household she gave me a present - Pomegranate Molasses of my own. I learned to use it in variety of recipes from deserts to meat sauces. It has a wonderful taste both tart and sweet at the same time. It has deep red color, and looks very appealing.<br /><br />It keeps almost indefinitely in the refrigerator. It blends well with walnuts, adds a unique flavor to beans, adds wonderful flavor to poultry, gives a nice taste to fish, gives an astringent edge to salads and vegetables, and is a great tenderizer for lamb and pork.<br /><br />I like its flavor even just diluted with cold water as a drink or adding tart flavor (and beautiful color) to sorbets.<br /><br />Ali Julia review"
2204,2204,2204,2205,5,"So I bought this pomegranate molasses to make Fattoush, the delicious middle eastern salad of greens, cukes, tomatoes and torn up bits of fried, leftover pita bread.  Wowee, Fattoush is now my favorite salad, I've eaten so often lately that the tart lemon-y dressing has made the corners of my mouth turn a bit pinkish and raw, youch. I tend to do that, find a food I really like, then eat it so much I almost make myself sick on it.<br /><br />Anyways, the Fattoush salad dressing, with it's complex blend of Sumac, olive oil and various herbs and spices required one half teaspoon of pomegranate molasses.  I was lucky enough to find it at a Russian grocery store (YAY!).  But the store is far away and so I had to look around online to buy more, thank God for Amazon.<br /><br />Now, granted, my bottle will likely last years if all I do with it is make Fattoush, one goopy half teaspon at a time, so I've used it in a few other things.  I added a teaspoon to a Lemon Chicken Marinade, a tiny glob to a bowl of greek yogurt (had to add honey too cuz it was sour!),  a tiny amount added to Christmas Salmon cream cheese log, I used it in Fesenjen, a persian stew of chicken and walnuts, I used a few tablespoons of the sticky stuff in a garlicky barbecue sauce and it was the best barbecue ever.<br /><br />Just don't do what I did and try to replace the molasses in molasses cookies with pomegranate molasses, what a horrible mess, the cookies looked normal, slightly lighter than normal, but the smell!  And the taste!  Ewwww!"
2205,2205,2205,2206,5,"Always wanted to make my own hummus and eggplant dip - this brand of tahini I'd never tried before or seen in supermarkets, so I decided to order and try it....excellent by itself or in recipes! Highly recommended."
2206,2206,2206,2207,4,This was a very good puchase. The shipper was very fast and very friendly. The Tahini was very fresh and of good quality. I will order again.
2207,2207,2207,2208,5,"We love to make Hummus, and love to make sandwitches, salad dressings. One of our kids favorite foods is Tahini over cold Undon Noodles."
2208,2208,2208,2209,5,"Having lived in the Middle East for 10 years, our family loves hummos and we make a lot of it.  This is the best brand I've ever found in the U.S.  I like the taste and the texture of this one, and it mixes wonderfully with the other ingredients.  I found it somewhere locally, then when I went to buy more I couldn't find it again.  Krinos is so much better than all the brands you find in health food stores or supermarkets, and the price happens to be about half of what most stores charge for a similar amount of tahini.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon!"
2209,2209,2209,2210,5,"I have never used Tahini before - and my hummus was good, but always, something was missing... After I found out of Tahini, I ordered it (and it was shipped extremelly fast)and used it. The result was amazing! One spoon into the hummus prepared from one bag (1lb beans) and I had my favorite ready to go!"
2210,2210,2210,2211,2,"Very bitter and not nearly as thick as expected. Very runny, actually. There are better brands out there."
2211,2211,2211,2212,4,We purchased these for our son to give out when his baby boy is born.  They make a very nice announcement of the new arrival.  They are however very hard if you actually want to chew the bubble gum.
2212,2212,2212,2213,2,"Hi,<br /><br />My first grandson was born and I wanted everything under the sun to celebrate!  This is a wonderful idea that has been around for a very long time!  HOWEVER......everything was fine and wonderful except the fact that they just weren't fresh.  These little bubble gum cigars were as hard as a rock!  The moral of the story is that being a ""fun"" item the shipping was as much as the cigars themselves....at least they could have been fresh and not hard."
2213,2213,2213,2214,1,"I purchased this item to celebrate the birth of my grandson.  I should have opted for real cigars, they might have tasted better. These cigars were very hard and hurt my teeth to chew. Not to mention that these gum cigars were much too sweet."
2214,2214,2214,2215,1,ordered some from an amazon-fulfilled associate. Normal amazon shipping etc...The cigars were cracked and stale. How does chewing gum shatter and break? No way it was fit for consumption.<br />Easy return process.
2215,2215,2215,2216,5,"This product arrived in a timely manner, in good condition, and it was a hit with the family when my son arrived."
2216,2216,2216,2217,5,"When our third child, and first son was born, we sent our oldest to school (Kindergarten) with these for her friends to celebrate. It really made her feel important at school, and helped her celebrate the birth of our little boy. She loved doing it, and her friends enjoyed them too. BTW- teachers, we did clear it with the teachers at school first, so no hate mail please!"
2217,2217,2217,2218,5,I have nothing but good service ever since I started ordering from amazon.com.  Keep up the good work.
2218,2218,2218,2219,5,"There is much confusion about tomatoes, and shopping on-line in this case adds to the complexity.  These are not the best tomatoes offered at the time of this writing.  The Strianese are hands down the best.  My local store sells them.  I have been using them for fifteen years.  But they are significantly more expensive and the shipping is brutal.  No Prime shipping with them.  I use these specific Cento when I am not home.  It all depends on how much your sauce means to you.<br /><br />But you need to know what you are buying.  These Cento tomatoes are 1) San Marzano sauce tomatoes; 2) they are D.O.P. certified 3) and this point is often overlooked, they are from the Sarnese Nocerino.  They are the second best in terms of absolute flavor.  Bright from proper acid, deep from proper natural salt/sugar balance.  You probably cannot get better tomatoes fresh unless you know a specialty grower, or do it yourself and have no day job.  Cento sells many others, much cheaper, that are not these.<br /><br />The price per can is good.  The best deal is if you have Amazon Prime and get regular shipments.  I get three large batches per case, enough to feed the mob that forms on sauce day.<br /><br />Most people are happy with the many good canned tomatoes, especially when you look at the poor genetically engineered ersatz ""fresh"" tomatoes at the supermarket.  But if you are a maestro, these are what you want."
2219,2219,2219,2220,1,"I've had a lot of San Marzano tomatoes in my day, both fresh and canned, and typically they are the best tomatoes on the planet. I opened the first can from this order, and the tomatoes weren't very good at all - nothing like I was used to. I later noticed that the can does not have the ""D.O.P. Certified"" label, like the photo on the Amazon page does. These tomatoes are not D.O.P. certified, and are not real San Marzano tomatoes. They are a cheap imitation.  The seller tried to mimic the label of real san marzano tomatoes so they could sell them for a higher price. I would recommend you stay away from these.  You can get better tomatoes for a fourth the price at your local grocery store."
2220,2220,2220,2221,1,The label is misleading. Cento actually sells two kind of San Marzano with the same label other than one that says D.O.P. certified. You will receive the one w/o the D.O.P. if you order from Amazon. I have made the mistake in the grocery store not realizing Cento sells ones are D.O.P and ones that are not and did not realize till it was too late. The true D.O.P. ones I have to say make the best sauce! You can taste the difference.
2221,2221,2221,2222,1,"Buyer beware! The label on the Amazon site clearly states ""D.O.P Certified"" but the product received does NOT match the site label and does NOT state ""D.O.P. Certified"" This is bait and switch and I will file a complaint with Amazon."
2222,2222,2222,2223,5,DOP San Marzano canned tomatoes are the finest canned tomatoes on the planet... but I can get these for literally half the price at my local grocery store. Is this unusual? Boston is pretty heavily Italian in some areas... maybe that makes a difference. i don't understand why anyone would buy them at this price. Check your local grocery store before you buy them at this price.
2223,2223,2223,2224,2,"You order (and pay for)D.O.P. Certified San Marzano tomatoes but you will receive ""CERTIFIED"" which means absolutely nothing. A true SM tomato will have an EU D.O.P emblem on the label plus the Corsorzio San Marzano stamp. This is false advertising.  If you enlarge the picture shown you can see on the upper left side partially one of the stamps. You will not receive this DOP label.  You will  receive another tomato from somewhere in the region under the Cento name. Typical marketing hoodwinking. Amazon refuses to take returns on this item, so beware."
2224,2224,2224,2225,1,"Since a DOP product is not readily available at my local grocery stores, I got really excited when I saw the photo of this product at the Amazon website because the photo states that this product is ""D.O.P. Certified.""<br /><br />But when I received the shipment, it was a huge disappointment.  It was a different product than what the photo promised.  (I can buy the one that was delivered to me at my local grocery stores very easily.)  Very disappointing............."
2225,2225,2225,2226,1,"I've used Cento San Marzano DOP certified tomatoes many times in the past and was always pleased with the quality of these great tomatoes.<br />That said, this is the 1st time I've ordered this item from Amazon and ALL 12 cans arrived completely dented and banged up!<br />Terrible presentation for an expensive item.<br />As an aside, none of the cans I received has a ""DOP CERTIFIED"" label but only ""CERTIFIED"" and no serial # on the side of the cans so I'm not sure if these tomatoes are actually DOP certified or not???"
2226,2226,2226,2227,3,"The Amazon product info claims they are a certified organic product.  The picture claims DOP certified.  Neither appears to be true.  The cans I received were just ""certified"", and it didn't say by who.  There is no USDA Organic label either.  I also knew all these things before I bought them since they are well documented in the Amazon reviews already, so I wasn't surprised by what I received.<br /><br />On the plus side, they are better tomatoes than I can buy canned in the grocery stores locally, so I'm happy enough with them, and I used reward points from my Amazon.com Visa to buy them, so they were essentially free to me.<br /><br />Would I buy them again?  Maybe.  If couldn't get any of the Strianese D.O.P. certified San Marzano tomatoes, then yes I probably would.  As I said, they are tasty and I do like them better than what I can buy locally, but they aren't the top tomato when it comes to what I can mail order."
2227,2227,2227,2228,4,"I discovered these wonderful tomatoes and yes, they are worth paying for. Unfortunately in my area they are approaching 6 bucks a can and never go on sale. Walmart has them for about 4 dollars a can, but I prefer not to be tied down to that store. The local ""Italian mart"" advertised san marzano tomatoes, 4 cans for 5 dollars- too good to  be true? yes, in fact , these are very ordinary tomatoes. I am on the hunt for these wonderful tomatoes at a good price.They turn an ordinary recipe into a gourmet experience."
2228,2228,2228,2229,1,"The can that is shown says D.O.P. certified but when my relative ordered them from Amazon.com, the cans that were shipped only indicate CERTIFIED. One can buy these non-DOP at any Walmart. What do they mean by CERTIFIED? Certified as to what?<br /><br />Unfortunately, the venders are making fools of Amazon.com. As a consequence, I am staying away from Cento products entirely. Fool me and Amazon once, shame on Cento; fool me and Amazon twice, shame on me and Amazon. There is no way I can make this review FUN!"
2229,2229,2229,2230,4,"I received my order with a few problems. The majority of the cans arrived dented, some very severely! Amazon needs to add better packing material to keep the cans from moving around in the shipping box, I am surprised they haven't fixed this shipping issue by now because of all the complaints here in the reviews. However, Amazon is really great when it comes to problems like this with food items...they are shipping me a new order, no charge, and I get to keep my original order! I am hoping my new order arrives in better condition! These San Marzano Tomatoes are not ""DOP Certified""! Even though the description says they are? Many people have complained about this in the reviews so I am surprised Amazon is still listing them as ""DOP Certified""? However, they are very good quality tomatoes and Certified Organic. I have also noticed the price of this item fluctuates often so here's a tip...place it in your shopping cart and then save it for later, check your cart daily and wait for the price to drop! I paid $20.79 but I have seen the price as high as $53.00, so it pays to be patient. Good luck!"
2230,2230,2230,2231,1,"these are not DOP they're just ""certified"" which means nothing significant. they should go a step further with a little more nonsense and write ""department certified"". real dop tomatoes are much better."
2231,2231,2231,2232,5,Purchased a small case of these tomatoes. I used them for Pizza Sauce and they tasted great. The labels looked identical to the picture posted on Amazon.
2232,2232,2232,2233,5,"I love San Marzano tomatoes and Cento's are great. They have the greatest, sweetest taste ever. Worth ever penny and than some."
2233,2233,2233,2234,1,They tomatoes are certified San Marzano but not DOP like the item shows in picture. I called amazon and they sent me another box of 12 for free to fix issue. THe new shipment was still certified not DOP.  So please know this. Tomatoes are ok but not the best fyi.
2234,2234,2234,2235,2,"I purchased a case of these tomatoes a couple of months ago, and the cans were so badly bent and warped my can opener won't open them.  I complained to Amazon and they shipped another case out right away - but those cans are worse than the first case!  I won't order again."
2235,2235,2235,2236,1,"The product image is misleading. The image has the tomatoes as D.O.P. certified, but the tomatoes I received are not...."
2236,2236,2236,2237,5,"these tomatoes are perfect for italian recipes.....full flavor, not too acidic and VERY italian!  Always the best choice for italian cooking...."
2237,2237,2237,2238,4,"most if not all of the cans were dented in some way, however it is a cheaper method of purchasing this product"
2238,2238,2238,2239,5,"This is a fine product.  Why? Sure, it's has a flavor that on other tomato has, an earthy taste."
2239,2239,2239,2240,1,Merchandise was not damaged during shipment but supplier send me damaged and incorrect merchandise.  3/4 of the cans were badly dented and the cans they shipped were not DOP Certified.  They sent me lower standard merchandise.  Received full refund from Amazzon.
2240,2240,2240,2241,4,"I have read past reviews where people complained about receiving dented cans with this product. I had a previous shipment where all was well, but not this time. The shipment came in a badly mangled box, but I thought all would be well when the interior box was pristine. I was very surprised to find a badly dented can in an undamaged box. This tells me that the can was already dented when packed. Amazon should reconsider their source for this product--the tomatoes are superior but the packing stinks."
2241,2241,2241,2242,5,"The product is great ... but it is priced nearly twice what it retails for in local markets. I dont mind paying a little for convenience of home delivery, but this is too much"
2242,2242,2242,2243,3,"Received Different than pictured. Labels Just say ""certified"" not ""D.O.P. CERTIFIED"". Don't know if that is the same and after a couple of orders I am not going to put the effort in to find out.<br />Also came with Basil. I want tomatoes only. Not Basil.<br />A couple cans dented like others have said.<br />My case was $44 now its $60.<br />I'm over the tomato thing. I'll buy what I want in the store."
2243,2243,2243,2244,1,"Of the 12 cans shipped 11 of them had very, very serious dents in them. I'm not talking dings, I talking serious dents.  So dented that I truly thought of throwing them away.  My husband stopped me though because at $5 a can he felt that it was too wasteful.  In my local grocery store, items this dented are put into a reduced price bin, because they usually don't move otherwise.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C4HZ00"">Cento San Marzano Certified Tomatoes, 28-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>"
2244,2244,2244,2245,5,"This product is indeed fabulous and you can get it at many grocery stores for a lesser price.  Overall a great product and makes awesome red sauce!  TO SQUISM:  I find it very disturbing that you casually refer to hitting your wife, even if you are joking, this is not the place for that sort of behavior!!!!  If you really hit your wife your a punk coward.  Domestic abuse IS NOT a laughing matter and I was personally offended by your review.  Try to maintain some amount of class when posting on here.  I am sure that is something you are incapable of doing, judging by your disgusting and classless review."
2245,2245,2245,2246,1,It's a shame to use so much corn syrup for babies! I'm very disappointed when I noticed that. The same kind sold in China is even better.

2249,2249,2249,2250,1,"I decided to try this formula for my baby since he started being very gassy. However, this formula made him more gassy...the formula is very thick and produces a lot of bubbles that gets fed to the baby. I tried to make the formula with anticipation to let the bubbles disolve but that didn't work."
2250,2250,2250,2251,5,"Good price for product... i had started my baby on the similac soy formula but it was too much for my son's tummy... this formula was a welcomed change.... unfortunately, it came at the funky time of similac's big recall of all the larger containers (i was buying the 34oz can from the wholesale store) and the smaller containers were all sold out of the local stores... not a fun situation... finding this 6-pack at a reasonable price was a much needed and appreciated rescue!"
2251,2251,2251,2252,2,"If your newborn cries inconsolably, you should try a lactose-free formula right away even though they're so expensive. However, the ingredients may not look so good.  It's important to shop around if you're going to use a lactose-free formula. Lactose-free formulas always are the most expensive and this one is loaded with processed corn syrup solids.<br /><br />From Wikipedia: ""Baby colic (also known as infant colic, three-month colic, infantile colic and colic) is a condition in which an otherwise healthy baby cries or screams frequently and for extended periods without any discernible reason."" You'll know it if it happens to your baby, and it's awful to not be able to do anything to immediately relieve your baby.  It contains DHA, ARA and iron, but all baby formulas do because it is required by law.<br /><br />Lactose-free formula is expensive is because it goes through a very specialized and difficult manufacturing process, I'm told by the company's public relations representative.  So much food in the U.S. is prepared with corn syrup solids, so that shouldn't be a worry, I'm told.  Ok, but I notice the obesity rate is high."

This did seem to work better than a couple other formula but I decided to try something else when I read about sugar.  We just changed over to Gerber Good Start Gentle and it does (so far) seem to be working better.  He is still gassy but he has less pain and doesnt seem in nearly as much discomfort when eating (he is a little colic but still loves to eat).  I do this this is a good product and I'm sure the sugar is safe, I just would rather not give extra sugar at this age (8 weeks).  Good luck!!"

2255,2255,2255,2256,1,"The description of this product is disceptive.  This product was represented as a powder, but it is not a powder, it's a granule.  It is nothing more than shredded coconut and doesn't even dissolve in a high speed commercial blender.<br /><br />Unless you are using this product to manufacture a dark chocolate-coated coconut patty, to me it is useless.  My intention was to use it as an additive in a healthy shake.  It ended up ruining the shake as I had to resort to chewing the undissolved, tasteless coconut pieces rather than drinking the shake.<br /><br />Additionally, the way the product was packaged, there was no protective cardboard preventing the slashing the top package when the box was opened.<br /><br />If I could have rated this product zero stars, I would have. The only redeeming quality was that it was rather inexpensive.  I gave one package away for FREE to a patient who loves coconut and she gave it back to me two days later complaining that it was terrible!"

I was able to turn it into cream/butter, using my super blender and adding some water, but it barely had any flavor.  I usually buy the Chao Kah brand of coconut cream (which is quite tasty and flavorful) and read another review for a different product for making your own coconut cream.  My complaint is not the shreds or texture.  Mine was just virtually tasteless."
2257,2257,2257,2258,4,"Although I had some concerns about product with initial shipment - my concerns were far overshadowed by the excellent, prompt and courteous response from vendor about my concerns.

2258,2258,2258,2259,2,"I bought this for our young son and was disappointed in several aspects of this dispenser:<br /><br />(1) It's made of cheap plastic and arrived w/ the globe scratched and cracked.<br /><br />(2) The top doesn't screw on--it just pops off w/ very little exertion.<br /><br />(3) Part of the appeal for me was that this dispenser is coin-operated.  What the description on Amazon doesn't tell you, however, is that a coin is not necessary to dispense the candy.  Furthermore, when the crank is just barely turned, the candy (usually two pieces) flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w/o your hand there to catch it.  A young child is often not coordinated enough to turn the crank and put his hand out to catch the candy.<br /><br />(4) The dispenser only came w/ enough candy to just fill the bottom of the globe.<br /><br />(5) It is very much over-priced at $29.99."
2259,2259,2259,2260,4,The M&M candy machine works just fine but the finger hole is too small for adult fingers to retrieve the candy. It does intimidate a M&M lover because of the small amount it dispenses.
2260,2260,2260,2261,1,"I was disappointed when I received this dispenser.  It said a large dispenser.  It looks like something for a child to play with.  I bought it for my husband to put in his ""man cave"".  He is a huge M&M fan.  I buy him a tree ornament each year from the M&M collections.  I was hoping it had more substance to it.  I also did not realize I was unable to return this item."
2261,2261,2261,2262,4,"I'm on my first jar of this, and am really enjoying what it adds to my ""concoctions"" - vegetarian one pan mix ups of onions, garlic, vegetables, usually tofu, rice or pasta or quinoa, sometimes olives or capers.<br />I may have purchased it at Uwajimaya, when on sale...I will be buying many more jars of this mixed spice paste.  It's not really a paste - more liquid, with easily identifiable basil leaves.  I highly recommend this chili paste."
2262,2262,2262,2263,5,"This deal on Amazon with the Prime free shipping, and/or the even cheaper subscription is very tempting if you make a lot of desserts with this like we do.  One of our favorites is layered graham crackers, this pudding mixed with frozen whipped topping, and topped with a can of melted chocolate frosting.  Lots of stores are discontinuing name brands, so this is a great item to buy here."
2263,2263,2263,2264,4,My husband LOVES pudding and any kind of dessert at the end of dinner. This is a great way to appease his cravings while not being full of butter and fat. I love that I can add whatever I want to it to fancy it up a little. I love to put cocoa powder and make a more elegant tasting chocolate pudding or mix it with berries for my kids.
2264,2264,2264,2265,5,"Like always this label is the best in desserts and this 3-4 ounce vanilla pudding is not the exeption, is easy to make, and vey fast, and the size is the best for a little families. The vanilla flavor is fantastic."
2265,2265,2265,2266,5,"You can substitute nut milk, coconut milk or goat's milk or even soy milk for the 'milk' in this instant pudding.<br /><br />If you add coconut cream and toasted coconut you have coconut cream pie pudding! If you add some raw cocoa powder you have chocolate pudding! You can add some softened cream cheese and have cheese cake base puddin'! You are only limited by your imagination. This is also excellent as an addition to a cake mix (about a 1/3 packet and an extra tablespoon of liquid)."
2266,2266,2266,2267,4,"i always enjoy Jello pudding, however, one package that i recieved was opened, and the powder spilled all over.  it really alters the price when you only recieve 23 packages instead of the promised 24."
2267,2267,2267,2268,5,"My big boy Oreo loves this so much. i took him off beef products and only give him venison rabbit ,turkey. He can't get enough of this stuff"
2268,2268,2268,2269,5,"Delivered by UPS, this product is just about perfect.  It does not have a disagreeable smell and the dogs love it.  It is much less expensive than prescription dogfood and our dogs are thriving on it.  You can even see an occasional pea and/or carrot. No grain to worry about."
2269,2269,2269,2270,5,"I have two terrier mixes and they love this product. I mix it with their dry grain free dog food and they just gobble it up like no tomorrow. I am happy that Amazon has this product on Subscribe and Save. It's one less thing to worry about since I know it's going to arrive every two months.<br /><br />When I know I'm going to be out of the house for a long time, I take this product and smear it inside a Kong toy. Oh Em Gee. Talk about keeping these ADD pups occupied for a period of time. :)<br /><br />Like the other buyer said, you occassionally see a piece of carrot or potato here and there.  I like looking at the ingredients on this product. There's no added water, mechanically separated meat or other by product. Good job!"
2270,2270,2270,2271,5,"Bought 1/2 lb each of five different Mo's Fudge recently from a school fundraiser. I'm not much of a chocolate fudge eater, prefer peanut butter, but the dark chocolate fudge is incredible. So rich and creamy! Almost too creamy. Had to throw it into the fridge to make it easier to cut. But if any fudge can turn me into a chocolate fudge lover, this can!"
2271,2271,2271,2272,5,"This mild semi-soft/soft cheese has a range of subtle flavors that I have yet to find elsewhere.  The price is worth it, though I can't afford to order it often, but the combination of this cheese with a really good white wine is truly a culinary delight!"
2272,2272,2272,2273,5,This tea is absolutely incredible! Addicted after first taste. So delicious... the smell... the taste... it's a beautiful experience. I just ordered more (and gonna try both regular and decaf).
2273,2273,2273,2274,5,"I love this tea and drink it at least twice a day.  The flavor is both strong and sweet.  The tea stands on it's own, never needing sweetner.  If you're a cinnamon lover, you have to try this tea.  And even if you're not, it's worth a try."
2274,2274,2274,2275,5,I am fairly certain this is the same tea sold by Caribou Coffee.  I think I could be considered an addict! The flavor is so good - lots of cinnamon and slightly spicy because of it.  Price for 50 is good and less than I have been able to find it elsewhere.
2275,2275,2275,2276,5,"After having to give up coffee years ago due to a medical condition, I tried many different kinds and favors of tea until I stumbled  upon this in a small bakery that had recently opened nearby. I loved it and have been drinking it every morning since over the past couple of years. The sachets are perfect for a larger mug, the paper wrapped are fine for smaller cups or mugs. It's a hearty tea that I find satisfying and delicious."
2276,2276,2276,2277,5,"As a person who love cinnamon scent and flavor, I find this tea amazing.  I was used to drinking the plain black tea at work and this blend is a nice change from that.  I can probably only have one or two cups a day because it is pretty sweet but I will continue to drink it probably every day.  Enjoy"
2277,2277,2277,2278,5,"Love this tea, its like drinking liquid red hots.  I hate herbal teas b/c they all taste and smell like potpourri but this stuff is awesome !!!!"
2278,2278,2278,2279,5,A co-worker gave me a couple of the Harney & Sons Fine Teas Hot Cinnamon Spice Sachets to sample. The cinnamon spice flavor is wonderful. These teas are not available at my local grocery stores. I was glad to find them for a reasonable price on-line.
2279,2279,2279,2280,5,I love this tea which has a deep cinnamon aroma and taste.  It's equally good as an iced tea.  Full marks!
2280,2280,2280,2281,5,"I drink a lot of flavored black teas and this is hands down one of my favorites. The scent is enticing and the flavor is bold, and sweet at the same time.  If you love spice, this is a must have tea."
2281,2281,2281,2282,5,"Super tasty, super delicious. Best tea ever, sweet and cinnamony. I actually like these better than the individually wrapped tea bags."
2282,2282,2282,2283,5,"This is an excellent tea, very flavorful - the cinnamon is fresh and powerful, and overall it's slightly sweet without needing any sugar. Excellent with milk or straight."
2283,2283,2283,2284,5,"This is more than just a tea, drinking a cup is like a beautiful experience. It has a multi-dimensional flavor, it really does. I never considered myself a tea drinker, but I ordered it once at a Starbucks and was hooked ever since. On special occasions or even when I am down, I treat myself to a cup of this warm and delicous tea."
2284,2284,2284,2285,5,It's that good!  Heaven if you like cinnamon.  Tastes sweet with no sugar.
2285,2285,2285,2286,5,I was actually surprised at how good these Muffins taste! I have reordered a case.  And they are Gluten Free.
2286,2286,2286,2287,3,"Traditional English Muffins are usually fat free or having very little fat.  This little challenger should be called something else all together.<br /><br />Closer to what I would say a croissant is, having all of the buttery taste and fat to go with it.<br /><br />Terrific if that's what you are looking for in an English muffin but not what I'm looking for.  I would rather save the fat for a chocolate dessert."
2287,2287,2287,2288,5,Had this sent to me in Afghanistan. The flavor was enjoyable but not to spicy. It is made with quailty ingridents. I would surely say this is one of the best salsa's I've ever had.
2288,2288,2288,2289,5,"I love VitaMuffins, but my supermarket sells one box of 4 muffins for $6.29.  Instead I bought the mix, 3 boxes for $16.00, and each box makes 12 muffins. Instead of $1.62 per muffin, the mix only requires water & eggs and works out to about 48 cents per muffin, and very easy to make. That's a great deal."
2289,2289,2289,2290,5,"I buy these through the ship-and-save program because they are a staple of my breakfast and midday snack routine.<br />Light, flavorful, and full of vitamins, these only take 20-25 minutes to bake with minimal extras. I am vegan so I use egg substitutes  (3 tbsps flax seed in place of the eggs with 9 Tbs water) and they still bake perfectly."
2290,2290,2290,2291,3,"I really like the frozen Corn Muffin Tops, but the mix resulted in a dryer product. I used the paper muffin liners and I think these might have added to the dryness."
2291,2291,2291,2292,2,"I found this muffin to be dry and very disappointing. If I cut it up and put it in a bowl with yogurt, it was OK. Would not order this flavor again."
2292,2292,2292,2293,5,better then I expected. I notice there was some complaints that the muffins were dry.<br />So I sprayed the mix before cooking with a butter flavored publix spray which is canola oil.[same as pam butter spray].<br />This did the trick& they were great
2293,2293,2293,2294,4,"I generally like vitalicious products. The corn muffin, well, for 100 calories it's not bad. But if you are expecting anything like the sugar/fat laden junk that your local bakery sells, look elsewhere. this is like a healthy makeover that doesn't quite cut it, but they're not bad. For the same amount of calories, the chocolate one is more of an indulgence, but this one is good for a bland breakfast treat, especially baked fresh.<br />My kids are happy to get any extra snacks, so they approve...i send with them to school for a midmorning snack. im glad they get fuel and vitamins."
2294,2294,2294,2295,1,The picture shown is for three packages and the price is fair for three but I was only sent one but was charged for three. Also the item sent was not the item shown. I can buy the item shipped all day long at any local grocery store. I went to Amazon because I was looking for the type shown.<br /><br />When I contacted the seller and told them about this they said they would give me partial credit for the item but nothing for shipping. Seeing as how I was shipped something I didn't order I should be entitled to a full refund including shipping. I was not offered that.<br /><br />If I could give this seller negative stars I would. Any future buyers beware.
2295,2295,2295,2296,2,Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.
2296,2296,2296,2297,5,"I like loose tea, I just don't like chewing on leaves in my tea cup, or having to dispose of a bunch of loose, soggy leaves that seem to find every corner of my kitchen. However, I'm spoiled rotten and only like the flavor that comes with brewing loose tea. So I've been using these empty tea bags in order to make loose tea a lot less messy and just as convenient as bagged tea. Most bags of this type I've encountered are made in Europe and come with a price to match, and a single pack of 100 doesn't last a whole long time.  When I saw this deal here on Amazon, I went for it.<br /><br />The bags look and work identically to the European made ones, although I believe these are made in India. (where they know a whole lot about making tea) But the price is about 2/3 less than that of the European made ones. I can't argue with that. (Well, I could argue with that, but I'm not a dope) That way, we can have the best tea on the market, which is sold loose, without the pain in the neck features of brewing loose tea with a tea ball or strainer. Just throw in the right amount of tea, tuck the top flap into the bag, and that's it. You now have a teabag of your favorite Kenyan Black tea (or whatever makes you happy) Throw away the neat little soggy bag when you're done - no mess at all.<br /><br />I've decided to get these on as a subscription, with a 6 pack arriving twice a year. That way, my family can have three cups or pots of tea each day (This size works for both), and maybe a few more on the weekend before running out. We've been using these bags for several months now, and are still as happy with them as we were when they arrived. If Amazon keeps offering these bags, I am sure we'll keep buying them!"
2297,2297,2297,2298,3,"The tea bags work well with loose tea and buying the pack of six makes this a good value. But what you're not told is that the bags are the large size, better made for large pots and not single cups."
2298,2298,2298,2299,5,I like loose tea and hate having to clean out the metal holders.  These bags are ideal as they let me make a pot or just a cup of tea and then throw it in the compost pile to be reused for my garden.
2299,2299,2299,2300,1,"Was shocked at the skinny size of this item!! They are five inches long as I expected, because that's the size I wanted and ordered, but can't be any bigger around than even a pencil and that's a BIG stretch!! WOW, I'm sure disappointed considering the cost ~~ $7 and shipping. Won't be ordering these again.<br />  Of course my dog likes them ok, but wouldn't call them her fav by any means. :(  Will I send them back? Don't know if it's worth the hassle at this point. But I will NOT recommend them either. Because of the size quality and high price compared to so many other products to choose from!  Keep looking is my advice. :)<br />  The other Beefeaters' products I ordered well met my standards. This one was a DUD!!  What's the old saying?  Buyer beware?  I fell into that trap big time!<br />  Here's the product link at this time:<br /><br />  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176AIDU"">Beefeaters Great Fillin Porkhide Rolls with Meaty Chicken Filling, 5-Inch</a><br /><br />  Wish you luck if you try this product...but again ""Buyer Beware!!""<br /><br />UPDATE 2.15.2012: My little dog got VERY SICK not too long after I wrote this review...I contacted Cust. Service with even more reason to not like this item and they refunded my money!! How's that for Customer Care?? :) Great!! Thank you Amazon.com ~~ you are TERRIFIC!!"
2300,2300,2300,2301,5,"My Scottish Terrier inhaled hers in about 2 hours, but my finicky Pomeranian, who usually turns his nose up at chew toys, loved it! It kept my Pom busy for a few weeks, but he really enjoyed it!<br /><br />Affordable price, fast shopping, great product!"
2301,2301,2301,2302,5,I love this frosting!  It's sugar free and I cannot find it in stores.  I will be ordering more in the future.
2302,2302,2302,2303,5,"Awesome little snack treat for your favorite pup/dog.  My two pekeingese just love these.  You can use them for training as well as just a treat.  They come in a variety of flavors.  My pups like the liver the best.  For senior dogs, these are perfect if they don't have the ""jaw"" power or teeth use anymore.  They are easy to carry so you can treat your dog whenever you want to for example on a walk around the neighborhood.  They are just 3 calories each so you don't have to worry about their weight.  Absolutely recommend these to every dog owner!"
2303,2303,2303,2304,5,"These are a hit with my pups, and for the price and 3 calories a piece, they can't be beat!  They're great for training in addition to putting them into food puzzle toys to keep them occupied.  I also provide a steady supply of these to my youngest pup during nail clipping as he has quite a bit of anxiety and these treats totally take his mind off of the scary clipper at his toes.<br /><br />First ingredient is wheat flour, so if your dog happens to be allergic to wheat these won't work for you.  My dogs aren't allergic, nor do these treats give tummy problems, so I'm happy!  Ingredient list is short, that's another plus, it's not a long list of artificial this and that.<br /><br />I give my pups both the liver flavor and the cheese/egg flavor to mix things up a bit.  The cheese/egg ones even smell like cheese, yum!"
2304,2304,2304,2305,5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002Z9BF8"">All Natural Dog Treats by Charlee Bear - Cheese & Egg - 16 oz resealable bag</a> These are absolutely great treats for training and for use with overweight dogs. At only 4 calories per treat, even an overweight dog can feel like they are getting treats too, especially in a multi-dog household where one dog is overweight, others are not. Taste must be wonderful since there isn't anything my dogs won't do for these tiny treats, so I'm very pleased with them for many reasons! GREAT PRODUCTS!!!"
2305,2305,2305,2306,5,"My dog's breeder sent home a baggie of cheese and egg flavored Charlie Bears for my Maltese puppy.  I used them to reward him from the get-go, and he will do just about anything if he knows this treat is coming.  A great training aid.  They are also small enough to give often, and are made with good ingredients.  I carry them in my pocket and my little guy keeps an eye on that pocket!"
2306,2306,2306,2307,5,"I love these treats for my two german shepherds. I think these treats are great for even large size dogs. My dogs absolutely go crazy for them, and they are only 3 calories per treat, perfect for training sessions. I also love the texture of them... you can put them in your pocket without a ton of flaking or gross smell. This product also has a simplified ingredient list... opposed to so many other dog treats out there. You can pronounce all the ingredients in the list and you know what they are getting."
2307,2307,2307,2308,5,"Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors."
2308,2308,2308,2309,2,"The treats were ok,my main complaint is they were small about the size of a lifesaver.Which made it hard to give them to my medium size dog as a treat.One treat just di not do it.This package should be labeled for toy or small dogs."
2309,2309,2309,2310,2,Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.
2310,2310,2310,2311,5,I am a middle aged runner and take this cherry concentrate to help my recovery time between long races.  This works better than Ibuprofen and is all natural.  After each long run I take a couple tablespoons with my Gatorade and my muscles recover quicker (I experimented with not taking it).  I love this stuff.
2311,2311,2311,2312,5,"Juice consentrate is very good. I like it as much as the Tart is Smart and with the price increase it is considerably cheaper even with subscribe and save. This will be my staple tart cherry juice from now on."""
2312,2312,2312,2313,4,"I have read a couple of the studies on the anti-inflammatory potential of tart cherry juice, and became convinced that it's worth a try (as a 57-YO athlete).  I like this product b/c the label tells exactly how many cherries a tablespoon is equivalent to, so I can make an informed choices as to how much I use, based on the number-of-cherry equivalents in the studies I've read.  I can't vouch for the accuracy of the label, but I've no reason to doubt it.  I've grown to like the flavor, especially mixed with lime seltzer!"
2313,2313,2313,2314,5,I am training for a half marathon.  At the start of my training I wasn't taking cherry juice.  As I increased my long runs each week my knees and hips were so sore.  I started to take this cherry concentrate and ever since then I have felt pretty good.  I take the juice every morning with my breakfast.  It has a very strong flavor but mixes well with apple or orange juice.  The half marathon I'm running in is this weekend and I feel ready for it thanks in part to the cherry juice helping reduce the pain.  This stuff works for me.
2314,2314,2314,2315,5,"I have pain and numbness down both arms from a pinched nerve at the bottom of my neck.  I started drinking this juice three months into what will likely be a four to six month recovery.  Because my doctor has put me on a long-term anti-inflammatory medication, I am not allowed to take over-the-counter medications like Advil and Tylenol.  I can say that taking a glass of this juice has the same pain-killing effect as taking two Advil.  I enjoy two glasses a day - one in the morning and one at dinner.  The only down-side is the sugar, which is really the only processed sugar I eat during the day.  The juice tastes good and the quality of the syrup is consistent and pleasant.<br /><br />I usually don't go for ""miracle"" foods or diet fads, but this juice simply works - this is the real deal.  It will not cure pain, but it will inhibit inflammation and facilitate faster healing of arthritis, spasms, and sprains."
2315,2315,2315,2316,5,"This juice is actually concentrated as advertised. Of all the juice concentrates of any flavor i have tried, this one is the most concentrated, and i expected the others to be as concentrated but they were all thin. I guess tart cherry juice tastes like fresh black cherries in general, but Montmorency RTCJ has the more tart best flavor!"
2316,2316,2316,2317,4,Tastes like drinking a cherry pie. I purchased this for my mother's gout and she told me it works quickly. It's also supposed to help lower blood pressure. Speedy delivery. It's not 5 stars because of the high price.
2317,2317,2317,2318,5,Every bit as good as any other brand I've tried. Fantastic taste and easy to use. This stuff can become addictive.
2318,2318,2318,2319,5,"I am a long-distance runner and a belly dancer.  My back objects to the dancing and my knees object to the running.  I was having a lot of trouble managing my pain and still doing my activities with ibuprofen alone.  I read about tart cherry juice in my running magazine, and I decided to give it a try after reading some of the other reviews here on Amazon.<br /><br />I am simply blown away by the difference!  My body really reacts to this stuff.  My knee pain has disappeared, and my back only hurts during really deep back bends.  I had same-day relief, too.  I can definitely tell the difference on days where I forget to take this!  As an added bonus, I have noted a marked decrease in how sore my muscles are, as well.  I wish I had heard about this sooner!<br /><br />I follow what it says on the bottle, 1 once twice daily.  At first, I was just using a tablespoon and licking it out of the tablespoon (2TBS=1 oz.), which I still do in the mornings, but good lord this stuff is tart!  The first one isn't too bad, I think mostly because your taste buds are in shock.  The second one really gets me, though!  Lately, I've been mixing my ounce into a cup of orange juice at dinner, which looks disgusting but tastes, surprisingly, really good.<br /><br />I really hope this product comes back in stock soon, I don't think I could go without it and I'm hesitant to switch to a different brand."
2319,2319,2319,2320,4,"Good, and reasonable for drink. A product that is good for sleeping and inflamation. I will buy again if the price stays reasonable."
2320,2320,2320,2321,5,"This cherry juice concentrate taste very cherry :-)  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032JKWGI"">Country Spoon Montmorency Red Tart Cherry Juice Concentrate 34 oz.</a> I like this product, and, perhaps, I will order this cherry juice concentrate again."
2321,2321,2321,2322,4,This is very good but I prefer the liquid cherry juice.  Less messy to deal with and the concentrate doesn't seem to go as far as the liquid juice.  Just my preference.
2322,2322,2322,2323,2,"I bought 2 bottles of this Tart Cherry Juice because they were cheaper than TART IS SMART. They may be providing the Anti Oxidents that they say but they completely failed me in helping to sleep better at night. I returned 1 bottle to Amazon & went back to TART IS SMART. I used to wake up 3-4 times a night & have trouble getting back to sleep. Being nearly 80 & retired, I can sleep in if I choose. With my TIS formula, I get to sleep fairly quick, wake up 7 hours later & get anothert hour or two after visiting the bathroom. This product may work much better for you but I found one that works for me & will stick with it forever. I hope to read YOUR opinion of this product soon?"

2324,2324,2324,2325,5,"I have managed to find these crackers in other countries on our travels but had run out. I love that they are individually wrapped small packets in a stay fresh container. This makes them great to carry in my purse, take to work or on airplanes for snacks etc. Also love that they are not overly salted like so many American brand crackers. Company that shipped them did a great job - fast too!"
2325,2325,2325,2326,5,"This is the best tasting cracker I've ever tasted.  It may cost less in a Filipino or Asian store ... which is all well and good unless you don't live close to one (I don't).  Note that the box says 1 pound 14 ounces - but the description on this page says ""28z"" (whatever a ""z"" is).  If they meant ""oz,"" it's incorrect.  It's a 30oz. box.  In any case, I was able to find it even cheaper online than the price shown on this page.  Where?  Amazon (grin).  Whenever you buy stuff like this, be sure to consider the ""bottom line"" price (product plus shipping) - and check for alternative Amazon pages where it's cheaper.  On this page, it's $15.78 for a 30oz box with free shipping (if you total order is $25 or more).  But on this page:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0066D2XVY"">SKY FLAKES CRACKERS 1x850G</a><br /><br />the same 30oz box costs only $9.00 + $5.49 shipping ... or $14.49 total, over a dollar cheaper than on this page.  So, buy from Amazon ... but not from this page."
2326,2326,2326,2327,5,This product is a quick snack very light and tasteful with any spread or just like it is. Takes up hardly ay space if a couple of packets are placed in your bag. Individually wrapped crackers makes it stay fresh for longer periods.
2327,2327,2327,2328,5,"If you like SweeTarts and you want them in a bulk amount, this product is for you. The SweeTarts came perfectly sealed and in excellent condition. There are no downsides."
2328,2328,2328,2329,4,Sweetarts evokes nostalgic memories of going into the candy store and pining for that sweet and sour chalky taste of this classic candy.  While it's a hard candy it is easily chewable and has pleasant texture and taste.  You really can't go wrong with this candy.  The only drawback is it is hard to stop at just one and before you know it you've eaten an entire roll.
2329,2329,2329,2330,5,"I have ordered these a couple times now. They arrive super fresh and sealed every time. I used to buy a roll a day from the gas station, now I have a stash at home that is available anytime. Yumm"
2330,2330,2330,2331,5,"I've purchased bulk candies where they are old, terrible flavors, or simply smashed to dust. This was a great buy, having none of those drawbacks."
2331,2331,2331,2332,5,"I used these for my sons bday party as one of the sweet treats to have out.  they are great, the kids all loved them and the price was fabulous, way better than purchasing elsewhere.  the item came as described and was fresh.  Thank you amazon.com"

2334,2334,2334,2335,5,"My family has been in love with Baci's ever since we lived in Europe.  When my daughters were small they coined the term ""Baci Pill"" for whenever they were hurt or not feeling well.  They are a wonderful treat, after a meal with espresso or cappuccino.  Pop the entire Baci in your mouth and experience the famous Perugina chocolate and then the still crunchy hazelnut center.  The Italians do everything with class and this beats a Hershey's Kiss any day!"
2335,2335,2335,2336,2,"I ordered this item in a large quanity, but wanted the items packaged as shown.  They were for favors in a holiday bag for the company employees.  When they arrived a few were packaged as shown but the bulk were loose.  If I had know they would come like this I would have gone to COSTO or some other discount store for the purchase.  The cute little box that would have helped make them special and what I thought I paid for was missing."

2337,2337,2337,2338,5,Just returned from Italy and was told these little chocolates were the favs of the Italians--perfect little two-chocolates for gifts -- and gloomy days -- or happy days --
2338,2338,2338,2339,5,"Delicious candy.<br />Outstanding price for such a rich product.<br />The ""fortunes"" on the inside are an added bonus.<br />Great options relating to packaging."
2339,2339,2339,2340,4,"My dog had been prone to ear infections and did a lot of paw chewing when his vet recommended changing his diet because his symptoms may be due to a food allergy. She specifically recommended the salmon and rice formula. Unfortunately, my dog hated the salmon and rice and it smelt extremely fishy. I tried the lamb and rice formula and he likes it much better. I've heard numerous good things about Wellness from my dog trainer, as well as other pet owners and pet store employees. My dog is adjusting to the new food well. However, I can tell he doesn't consider it the most tasty of choices- probably because it doesn't have the artificial flavoring in it. But I'd rather him eat something much healthier even if we have to sacrifice a little on the taste."
2340,2340,2340,2341,5,"I got this food for my dog that is allergic to corn, wheat, potatoes, flax, fish, and pork.  I had the hardest time finding a food that he wasn't allergic to.  I'm so glad I found this food.  He is finally eating and starting to put on some weight.  It is a little pricey but I think it is worth it for such a good product."
2341,2341,2341,2342,5,"Instead of Simple Solution Lamb & Rice I was sent Simple Lamb & Oatmeal but, my dog likes it. Next time I will make sure I am sent the right food. I didn't know until I had open and put the food in my 10lb container."
2342,2342,2342,2343,4,"If your dog eats slowly & actually chews his food, then this food is fantastic!  We have 2 dogs, 1 that is a picky eater, so we added water and microwave his food for 30 sec.  He loves his dinner & keeps It down. ( full disclosure, he's not the dog with stomach problems.  Our Boston Terrier, who we adopted from a puppy mill situation, eats by gulping down her food, from her years when she had to fight for food.  She is the dog we were targeting by getting sensitive stomach food; she was having a problem with vomiting & regurgitation.  The good news is, if we get her to eat 2-3 small meals a day and try to get her to slow down, problem solved.  Yet, if she eats fastly, without chewing, regurgitation is still a problem.<br /><br />I gave the food 4 stars because. If we do make sure she chews it ( by feeding her a couple morsels at a time, like giving treats) the food stays down, therefore working for vomiting, which was a huge proplem! (she was vomiting 6-9 times a day.) since switching she has stopped vomiting. I don't think our dog is the only one that eats fast, and it does take much longer to feed her."
2343,2343,2343,2344,5,My Dogs love this natural kibble.  It's simple (only rice and protein) yet tasty.  They maintain a healthy weight and have regular and healthy bowl movements.  Wellness is a fantastic product for dogs because they keep in mind the many ingredients that are not natural to a dog's diet and keep it out of their food.
2344,2344,2344,2345,5,"I have a dog with severe allergies we have been fighting for years. The vets always recommend mass produced allergy formulas like science diet.  I can't stomach feeding my dog that type of garbage. But simple is a good alternative, made with quality ingredients and the dogs love it too.  Great product!!"
2345,2345,2345,2346,5,"Before my oldest golden started eating this food he got a lot of ear infections. He ate grain free food, but he still got them. Both my dogs like this food and their coats are nice and shiny and their ears are super clean. I really recommend it.<br /><br />While you can get it for $1 cheaper on other sites, you pay $18 for shipping.<br /><br />I only wish Amazon had more than 3 bags of it each time!"
2346,2346,2346,2347,5,quality food but the price is very high.  luv amazon's free ship over $25.
2347,2347,2347,2348,5,"I was so excited to get my whole wheat pizza dough.  After ordering it, I got it two days later!  The directions are easy to follow and the taste of the crust is phenomenal.  The toppings I added to my pizza were shrimp, chicken, cherry tomatoes, Mexican cheese blend, and turkey Canadian bacon.  The pizza turned out great! Only 8 Weight Watcher's Point Plus value per slice.  This is a better alternative to other leading pizzas."
2348,2348,2348,2349,4,My husband does not like whole wheat anything but he liked this pizza dough. It was very simple to make and spread on our pizza stone. We put Rossi Pizza sauce and mozzarella cheese on and it was great!
2349,2349,2349,2350,5,Great stuff!Love that it's organic and raw. But later saw same thing @ TJ's for less than half the price!
2350,2350,2350,2351,5,I love this organic raw honey!<br /><br />When using it in my tea I don't need a lot and the taste is great.<br /><br />Honey is also helpful with moisturizing and healing so other than consuming it I also use it on my hair and face often. The darker the better.
2351,2351,2351,2352,5,I absolutly love these candies that are only put on the market at Christmas and Valentine's Day. I would buy them all year if they were available: SO you can imagine how excited I was tao be able to get them for a while through Amazon.I can wait untill Christmas when they will be available again.
2352,2352,2352,2353,5,"Cant find this flavor in the stores, so bought them here online.. Like them so much better than the Peppermint ones... I also like the Cinnamon Ones... Yum-O(as Rachel Ray states)..."
2353,2353,2353,2354,5,The local merchants quit stocking this. Was pleased to buy this on line so I can make French Canadian pea soup again. 5 stars for ability to obtain since quality is not that much of a factor. All of Bob's Red Mill products are 5 star.
2354,2354,2354,2355,4,"Its hard to find this stuff locally. Usually my parents have to bring it to me when they visit. Was pleased to find it on Amazon.<br /><br />Makes GREAT, TASTY dhall. We eat a lot of it, so its nice to know I can get it here again when I need it."
2355,2355,2355,2356,5,Bought these for a change from the green split peas. They are tasty and I like them. Will buy again. Always like Bob's Red Mill products.
2356,2356,2356,2357,2,"When tea is decaffeinated, is all the flavor removed? Or is this just lousy tea? In any case, all you get from a couple of these tea bags in a (12 oz.) mug of hot water is--hot water! True, the hot water is slightly brownish after five minutes of steeping, but there's no tea flavor at all. Very disappointing."
2357,2357,2357,2358,5,"Full bodied tea, no loss of flavor even though it is decaffeinated. Comes stored in its own heavy duty zipper plastic bag to ensure freshness during shipping. A great value for a good tea."
2358,2358,2358,2359,5,"With the departure of Starbucks coffees, I reluctantly switched back to the other t-discs carried by local stores. I tried, I really did. But, it seemed like every other one I tried, which was basically every other one made, including the European t-discs, were not rich enough to satisfy me. I finally gave up and went back to an old fashioned drip coffeemaker so that I could make a nice, rich cup. I was still frustrated by the waste, since I'm the only coffee drinker in my home. Plus, being a basically lazy person, I didn't enjoy filling the reservoir every time I wanted to brew a pot, washing the pot out afterwards, or cleaning out the grounds from the filter.Recently, Tassimo/Gevalia came out with a dark house blend. The front of the package noted: ""New! If you like Starbucks House Blend, try this!"" As a last shot attempt before packing up my Tassimo for storage, I purchased this new t-disc coffee. Tasting my first sip, I was so HAPPY. Really really HAPPY! My coffee is so important to me, and the Gevalia Dark House Blend is AMAZING!!!! It's a rich, full bodied cup of coffee, and as I drink this day after day, I'm starting to think it's even better than my old favorite Starbucks flavors. It's as bold as Starbucks with no bitterness at all. I'd love to hear what others think of this. I am very pleased with it, and I'm so glad that I am able to go back to the simplicity of using my Tassimo brewer, because they make a great t-disc again!"
2359,2359,2359,2360,5,"This is the best thing from Gevalia.  I was drinking the Starbucks Africa and Verona before ""the breakup.""  I tried the Dark Breakfast from Gevalia, but it's horrible.  I can only drink it after adding the Maestro Lorenzo Espresso Intensivo.  That makes quite a nice cup with a good kick to it.  I even need a little cream in it to smooth it out a bit.<br /><br />But this one is just right.  It's a nice strong cup that doesn't need cream, but can take cream without losing flavor.  This is the first hope I have had for saving my Tassimo machine.  I don't want to go back to the Keurig.<br /><br />p.s.  I would still like a good decaf option.  Right now I use the Gevalia Signature decaf and add a shot of Gevalia decaf espresso to jazz it up."
2360,2360,2360,2361,5,I've tried all three new 'Dark' offerings from Gevalia and I think this is the best one from the three. Gevalia finally came up with coffee worth serving to your guests.<br />Coffee has an earthy bold taste with little to none bitterness and no metallic after taste; it actually leaves a nice smooth tasty chocolaty after taste.<br /><br />The pack comes with 12 big T-discs that will brew 8 ounces of coffee. This coffee will delight those who love the darker roasts.<br /><br />Update:<br />I am on my 5th cup of this coffee and it was really grown on me (changing from a 4 to 5 stars); it is quite tasty and smooth. This is one coffee that will truly satisfy the void that Sbux left. There will be some that will say that this is not the same as Sbux and it isn't! Try the coffee and give it a fair taste without trying to compare it to anything else you may find yourself quite surprised at the findings.  Highly recommended and definitely will be buying this one again.
2361,2361,2361,2362,4,"finally some new varieties of tassimo ... I drink everything from DD to starbucks to nespresso to good blends from fairway .. this one is pretty much right on with the description - dark brew good medium body - it has a strong flavor but is smooth and no aftertaste at all, reminiscent of how sbux does brew their beans (but I like this better than the sbux house coffee..it's not quite as edgy), and is unlike many of the other gevalia coffees for Tassimo that I just don't like b/c of their aftertaste (bitter, to me) .. this one brews at 190 degrees (at least mine did), which is a bit hotter than I would make a cup of latte for example (at 160) so be careful on that first sip!  but I do think this one's a keeper..."
2362,2362,2362,2363,5,"Together with many customers, I was frustrated when Tassimo and Starbucks ended their relationship. My coffee was Verona.<br />Since that time, I have tried various alternatives (Gevalia Espresso, Tassimo Carte Noir, Tassimo Nabob & Kenco Med Roast) but with limited and varying degrees of success.<br />After reading a previous review, I sent off for a supply to test it - I love it!!!!<br /><br />I was on the point of giving my Tassimo machine away - no more.<br /><br />A great start to the New Year."
2363,2363,2363,2364,5,"I recently got a tassimo machine and really like it, but the initial coffees that I tried were not as good as what I used to make by the pot. This one finally blew everything else away. It's delicious. The dark house blend is now my preferred t-disc when I want coffee. Since I'm not a coffee snob I don't like to get crazy with the adjectives, but this one has a very deep and pleasing coffee flavor. Full-bodied is a good way to describe it, as opposed to a lesser-bodied coffee that may smell good but tastes watered down when you drink it. This is definitely the best coffee I've ever tasted out of a home brewing machine and even better than many cafes can muster. It has no aftertaste and it is not bitter. You can drink it black with no sweetener and enjoy it, or add some cream. Even if you go heavy on the creamer it doesn't lose is flavor. Buy it, and ignore the starbucks haters. Seriously, starbucks' coffees are not as good as everyone makes them out to be. Dunkin Donuts coffee has them beat in price and quality."
2364,2364,2364,2365,5,"I love this coffee, its dark but not bitter and smooth as silk. Its a big cup size 12oz so its great in the morning when I don't want to get up for coffee too much. If you have a Tassimo you should have this coffee blend on hand!"
2365,2365,2365,2366,4,it tastes pretty decent but I wasn't aware how pricy they were when I bought them.  I paid $17.44 for a pack of 12!!!  What a rip off!
2366,2366,2366,2367,5,"I loved the quality and the taste of these cookies. They are not too sweet and they will live to your expectations. To the person that posted a bad review, just a small comment. They are called meltaways because they have real butter, go figure. If you are interested in low fat food, look elsewhere. It like complaining that french fries are fried, or that chocolate is fattening. Just saying."
2367,2367,2367,2368,5,"These were so, so good, and I love that they're made with whole wheat flour and a healthier sugar substitute (not aspartame or splenda).  I looked at some Atkins peanut butter cups I'd just bought, and they're a higher percentage of saturated fat than these cookies.  I worry a lot more about the sugar in a product than the fat, unless it's made with soybean oil or lists trans fat.  I list this as one of my ""healthy snacks.""  And since I'm over 40, size 4, with no health problems - I must be on the right track of what ""healthy"" is. :)<br /><br />One customer said hers were ""greasy.""  Maybe hers were in the heat, and the butter got hot?  I'm now placing my third order for these. They're worth it!"
2368,2368,2368,2369,3,"I love these cookies, but this paticular batch was stale, very hard, & I had to dip them in my coffe to eat them easily."
2369,2369,2369,2370,4,"My husband is gluten sensitive, dairy sensitive, and diabetic, so it is very difficult to find desserts for him.  Usually, if it's gluten free, it has waaaay too much sugar, for example.  I tried a box of these cookies for him.  He tried them and said that they are surprisingly good.<br /><br />They are not mereingues, even though they are shaped like those types of cookies.  They are regular cookie consistency.  There are just a few in a package, so they are rather expensive.  However, they are less expensive than buying all the materials yourself and having them fail.  (Can you tell I have made some bombs in my time as a specialty cook? LOL)"
2370,2370,2370,2371,1,"If you are ordering cookies, beware, the 'cookies' arrived in crumbles, so, if you want a box of stale crumbs order away :)"
2371,2371,2371,2372,1,"Two of Aunt Gussie's cookies contain 23% of daily fat allowance!  The cookies are so full of grease they fall apart.  They may be sugar free and gluten free, but they make it up with mostly FAT!  I can't even give them to my grandchildren!"
2372,2372,2372,2373,5,"I was looking for some nutritious snacks - with fiber - and came across these.  I've tried this variety and the oatmeal/flax ones and both are very good. They have a dryish texture but are full of flavor.  Wouldn't say they're like home baked, but there is no ""artificial"" taste at all. They're generous in size (3-4 inches diameter, almost an inch high) and though not calorie lightweights (120-140 each depending on the variety), they have 3-4 grams of fiber each. Highly recommend these for healthy snacking or even a quick breakfast."
2373,2373,2373,2374,5,"After years of brandy-soaked Twinkies, I just tried one of these tonight.  Wow!  These are good.  My wife was right:  They're good.  But not so good you go crazy and eat the entire box.  It may be the whopping 3 grams of fiber in these tiny little things.  I think it's actually my stomach screaming, ""NO MORE!  I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE FIBER!  I'M GONNA BLOW!""<br /><br />They remind me of the homemade wholegrain hippy Eucharist from the late 70's and early 80's.  Heavy, moist, whole-grain goodness.  Takes me back to my Catholic school days.  They used to let us kids eat all the leftover homemade wholegrain hippy Jesus after a mass.  Good times."
2374,2374,2374,2375,4,"Whole grain ingredients and good tasting.  Most Kashi products have mostly white flour with very little whole grains, but these cookies are primarily a whole grain mix. It's nice to have a treat that is more nutritious and still sweet enough for my sweet tooth!  There are several varieties of Kashi cookies, and they are all good."
2375,2375,2375,2376,3,"They taste nice, but they made my stomach hurt and gave me a bit of flatulence issues (because of the chicory root fiber). It also made me bloated."
2376,2376,2376,2377,4,"YES, these are wonderful and healthy cookies, but this is a rare bad deal from Amazon (really DAB Nutrition)- they are charging about $25 (including shipping).  In less than a minute of web searching I found the same quantity for about $15 shipped.  Enjoy the cookies, but buy from someone else until the price comes down."
2377,2377,2377,2378,4,"Yummy. Good flavor. I wish they were softer and not so crumbly......and for some odd reason they give me heartburn, and I never get heartburn. I still like the flavor."
2378,2378,2378,2379,5,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:00 Mins<br /><br /></span>These cookies are so great! Watch our video to see how great they really are!!!"
2379,2379,2379,2380,5,"These were shipped out the day after I ordered them and arrived within 5 days.  (I live on the opposite coast where these are made.)  My order arrived nicely packaged.  For the price, I got 1 lbs. 4 oz. of biscotti (I weighed it on my kitchen scale) cut into 10 big pieces.  Add the shipping and handling, and that comes out to a little more than $2 per piece.  This is approximately what my local bakery charges per biscotti too (when they have some.)  So, I guess this is the going price for homemade biscotti these days?<br /><br />The flavor is very almondy. And, the hardness is just perfect.  The biscotti is hard and crunchy, but it's not so hard that you couldn't eat it without dunking (as some biscotti are).  This biscotti can be eaten ""as is"" or can be dunked in coffee, tea or cocoa.  I dunked mine in Chai Tea and it tastes great.  And, the biscotti does not fall apart when dunked.<br /><br />I like the almond flavor, but I wish this came in anise flavor.  That's my favorite biscotti flavor."
2380,2380,2380,2381,5,"This coffee has a smooth, carmely, dark finish that I love! My husband gets other dark blends that taste like charcoal to me. This one is very smooth, with just a hint of sweetness. I wish that Amazon had it on its monthly purchase program, would love to save 15% on it! However, I was glad to find it someplace besides Green Mountain. As prime members, we can get our coffee replaced in 2 shipping days v. a week or longer over at GM. Sweet!"
2381,2381,2381,2382,5,"This is the fifth different type of coffee I've tried with my Keurig coffee maker. Right now, it is tied with a Newman's Own k-cup as my favorite. A couple k-cup products seemed fine when I first tasted them, but have come to pale somewhat in comparison with other flavors and makes.<br /><br />This is a really smooooooooooooooooooth tasting coffee. It does not have a strong taste, but goes down very easily. There is a richness to the taste as well.<br /><br />Bottom line? I will be purchasing this again when my supply runs out as I continue experimenting with different flavor k-cups."
2382,2382,2382,2383,5,"Great coffee.  Rich, robust.  A coffee-lovers choice.  If you like French roast or Italian roast, you will like this coffee."
2383,2383,2383,2384,5,"I am a coffee snob. Yes, I admit it. I prefer fresh roasted Kenyan coffee, but also like Sumatran, Jamacan, Guatamalan, even Etheopian. I generally say that I don't drink Columbian. Most K-Cups are weak and less than stellar, though I have found several I enjoy. I was surprised by Caribou's Mahogany! It is excellent. Strong enough with an earthy, winey taste and smoothe finish (my description).  I eagerly tried their Daybreak, to my disappointment. Just ordinary. I don't often write reviews, but if this can get someone else to enjoy Mahogany it is well worth the time. If you have similar taste in coffee give it a try!! (and no, I don't work for them.)"
2384,2384,2384,2385,5,I love this coffee. Very dark but not at all bitter. I finally found one I like as much as Jet Fuel.
2385,2385,2385,2386,5,"My husband loves strong Caribou coffee but I like the milder one or ""breakfast<br />type. I will drink this but Caribou of all kinds is a great coffee,no matter<br />how strong. It will not disappoint."
2386,2386,2386,2387,5,"This morning, for the first time in my life, I tried Mahogani Caribou Coffee only because I had run out of my usual type of coffee, which I would usually brew and drink. In short, I should not even categorize Mahogany Caribou as coffee!!!! You know why? It has far more anti-depressant and uplifting effect on me than I had previously anticipated. From now on, I will only drink Mahogany Caribou."
2387,2387,2387,2388,5,"You can taste the wood in the respect it taste like the coffee was roasted over wood.  It is VERY smooth, I detect no bitterness or over roasting.  Nice flavor.  My newest favorite amoung the k-cup line.  My old favorite was Donut Shop but not any more.  I am not as pleased with the other Caribou flavors but this one really surprised me."
2388,2388,2388,2389,5,"Most Caribou coffees are too weak for me. This one is a delicious exception. It's right up there with Revv, Emeril's bold, or Van Houtte's eclipse. A Dark bold coffee without tasting burned or bitter."
2389,2389,2389,2390,5,"Caribou's Mahogany is my favorite k-cup coffee.  It's got a great, rich taste.  It's dark, but not bitter."
2390,2390,2390,2391,5,It has a nice strong flavor with no bitterness.<br /><br />How strong is it? I would say it is similar in strength to auto-drip using 1 rounded tablespoon of coffee per 8oz of water.
2391,2391,2391,2392,5,"I've been drinking Green Mountain's Dark Magic and really enjoyed it, however I wanted a change.  After some searching I discovered this coffee and am glad I did.  It's got an excellent deep flavor that I really enjoy.  Strong enough - yet not overpowering.  I recommend you give it a try."
2392,2392,2392,2393,4,"I agree with the other positive reviews I see here.  Nice flavor, strong-ish, no bitter, grind-y or conference coffee flavors to mess it up.<br /><br />For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.<br /><br />My favorite k-cups are:<br />Starbucks French Roast<br />Starbucks Caffe Verona<br />Starbucks Pike Place Roast<br />Green Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran Reserve<br />Green Mountain Double Black Diamond<br />Green Mountain Revv<br />Green Mountain Dark Magic<br /><br />Other k-cups I've tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel ,Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf, Emeril Jazzed up Decaf, Starbucks Caffe Verona, Coffee People Black Tiger,  Starbucks House Blend, Starbucks Breakfast Blend, Starbucks Sumatra, Wolfgang Puck French Roast, Green Mountain Lake and Lodge, Green Mountain French Roast, Caribou Mahogony, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya, Emeril Big Easy Bold"
2393,2393,2393,2394,4,This coffee has a good flavor and a good strength.  At first it seemed strong but then I got use to it.  I recommend this flavor coffee. Good wake up in the morning.
2394,2394,2394,2395,4,"Very nice, smooth cup of coffee.  Caribou Coffee has been a favorite of mine since the first time I visited Minnesota and had the opportunity to go to a store and have coffee.  I have since done mail order for their coffee and after purchasing a Keurig coffee machine was happy to see it was available in K-cups.  I also enjoy the Caribou Blend but I have to say this blend has a little more ""kick"" to it but still a smooth coffee with no after taste."
2395,2395,2395,2396,5,"I hadn't tried Caribou brand K-cups before and am extremely picky.  I like a rich, intense, well-bodied coffee and this product delivered.  Strong but no bitter taste, when brewed with 6 oz. water.  I would recommend this product to anyone with similar tastes and will definitely buy it again."
2396,2396,2396,2397,5,This is one of my favorites.  It's smooth and rich and not too strong for morning but also bold enough that if I like a cup in the afternoon it will do for that too.  My only problem is that I can never find it locally - I almost always have to get it online which is usually more expensive.  I've tried the Obsidian as a substitute and I don't like that one quite as much as the Mahogany.
2397,2397,2397,2398,5,"This is probably my favorite k-cup so far. I'm no professional taster so talk of flavor notes in coffee or elsewhere usually leaves me scratching my head and thinking, ""if you say so..."". But at my first sip of this dark, smooth coffee, I though chocolate. It's not flavored or sweet but, for me, it has a ""note"" of good, dark chocolate. Highly recommended if you like your coffee strong and full of flavor."
2398,2398,2398,2399,5,"Very Smooth Rich flavor even on the largest setting, dark blend a very satisfying cup of coffee. I will recommend this to my friends.  This product arrived on time well packaged."
2399,2399,2399,2400,5,"Obviously taste is an opinion but in my humble opinion this is the best coffee out there for Keurig and I have tried a billion. I love dark roast but Starbucks' French roast, Sumatra, and others I can't remember off hand seem to taste stale to me or not as bold. Can't stand any of Caribou's other dark roasts, such as Obsidian which you can get at Target sometimes. All in all, I am hoping this one sticks around, Ange's personal fav."
2400,2400,2400,2401,5,"Smooth. Full of flavor. Not bitter. No nasty aftertaste. People that like Newmans extra bold, Starbucks Verona and Sumatra, Tullys French Roast and other dark cup should love this.  It's better!"
2401,2401,2401,2402,4,"Although I've only been able to try three of Caribou's k cup blends (Mahogany as well as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G"">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474VPLI"">Caribou Coffee, Daybreak Morning Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>), I've found that Caribou consistently produces the highest quality k cups.  They are head and shoulders above their competitors like Green Mountain and Van Houtte.<br /><br />I should mention that Caribou's Daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the 20 or so I've been able to sample so far.  But I enjoy a flavorful medium roast.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers an extra bold dark roast.  After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.<br /><br />Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.  This coffee packs a powerful punch.  Although that isn't normally my thing, I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener.  My boyfriend adores it, though, and it has become a staple blend for him.  I will still drink this on occasion, but it's a bit too potent for me.<br /><br />I think this is the best dark roast I've had the chance to try."
2402,2402,2402,2403,4,"Nice bold taste but with a little ""packaged"" overtone.  Like other K-cup products this is just a shade below fresh."
2403,2403,2403,2404,5,"Got this in a k cup sampler, the best k cup so far.  If you like good strong coffee with a lot of flavor, slight hint of cocoa, this is it.  No bitter after taste.  This one goes on top of my reorder list, perfect for the K Cup System.  The one reviewer on this post that gave it one star has no taste buds."
2404,2404,2404,2405,5,"my wife and I are avid Keurig coffee fans (with three brewers between the two of us). We started out ordering all the flavored pods and soon learned than are likes were back to the basics ..... we each have a couple of ""full"" strength and then go to the ""de-caf"" for that last cup.<br /><br />Mahogany is my choice for the full blend.  It's smooth ....has an excellent taste and aroma.<br /><br />We are totally satisfied with this order ....."
2405,2405,2405,2406,5,"The name of this coffee is Mahogany, in my mind a deep rich brown. The coffee flavor is deep and rich, and the color is dark brown. It is delicious."
2406,2406,2406,2407,2,"Carabou Mahogony is the worst tasting cup of coffee I have ever had, and I've been drinking coffee for over 4 decades. It tastes just like a piece of burnt toast. The only way I can make it palatable is to put it over ice, add lots of vanilla sugar syrup and milk. I've got to find some way to justify the purchase and icing it seems to help."
2407,2407,2407,2408,5,I ordered the Mahogany Caribou Coffee K-Cups and adore them.  I recommend this product if you like bold coffe with a smooth taste.
2408,2408,2408,2409,5,This is a serious cup of joe. Yummyness!<br />I have turned at least 3 friends onto this coffee.<br />Robust and aeromatic
2409,2409,2409,2410,5,"this is maybe the greatest coffee ever made.  i have had this many time before in regular bean that i grind myself,  but never in k-cups.  Tastes the exact same and its maybe my favorite coffee ever"
2410,2410,2410,2411,5,"I like the taste of this coffee. Tried the other brands but got stuck on this one, I also like the ECO friendliness of the company."
2411,2411,2411,2412,5,"This is the best Caribou kcup if you like a dark, hearty roast with good flavor and little acidity.  Will definitely buy again."
2412,2412,2412,2413,5,"I have been drinking Tully's Kona for the past 2 years, but with the price increase of kona, I needed to find something less expensive. After trying numerous kcups, this Mahogany is just as good as the Kona, with a full coffee flavor, and a hint of caramel. I am happily converted."
2413,2413,2413,2414,4,I enjoyed this because of the full taste I get out of it without it being too bold or having a burnt taste.  To me it is a bit above the medium blend.  I do take creamer with my coffee so the boldness may be tamed down. I will definitely order more of this when I'm am out.
2414,2414,2414,2415,5,"I could get very used to this!  This is a nice, strong, robust coffee without bitterness.  The K-Cups are so convenient and make no mess."
2415,2415,2415,2416,5,I really enjoy this coffee - I have used a variety of the K-cups and this is one of the best.
2416,2416,2416,2417,5,Strong smooth velvety flavor.  Mahogany describes the color and the mood you get when drinking. Absolutely the best. I've found my favorite.
2417,2417,2417,2418,5,"Of all the coffees I've tried -- and I've tried A BUNCH -- this is hands-down my favorite.  Great bold taste but no bitter aftertaste.  I drink coffee all day, and I like it strong and fresh.  It can be difficult to find a stronger tasting coffee that's really great without cream or sugar, I drink my coffee black.  I've not yet found anything I like better.  Yum..."
2418,2418,2418,2419,3,"Too mild for me... I like a strong flavor. My wife likes this coffee. Has enough flavor and boldness to keep it enjoyable and not feeling like water downed coffee. If you like strong, bold coffee, you will be disappointed. For a mild coffee, I found this good, but not good enough to warrant the higher cost over many of the other brands.<br /><br />I will not be re-ordering Caribou Mahogany. My wife prefers Donut Shop brand over this. Again, not strong enough for me, but still makes a good cup of coffee."
2419,2419,2419,2420,5,"If you're a fan of full-bodied coffees, give this one a shot.<br /><br />For my taste, the vast majority of k-cups are too watery and weak (even on the small cup setting), so I gravitate towards the extra-bold varieties.  I had previously been enjoying Newman's Own Extra Bold and GM Dark Magic.  After reading some favorable comparisons between those and Mahogany, I decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />I find that it's slightly less bitter (not that bitter is bad) than Newman's EB or Dark Magic, and a little smoother.  I also think it's more full bodied without any burned bean flavor.  I've tried the Mahogany on the larger cup setting and actually still liked it -- something I've never said before."
2420,2420,2420,2421,4,"I've sampled many different k-cup coffe types. I prefer a really robust coffee and Carbou mahogany really dosn't provide that. I would cassify it as medium roast coffee with a smooth melow taste. If that is what u are after , then give this blend a try."
2421,2421,2421,2422,4,"No bitterness.  A strong, full-bodied, cup but does not taste like ashes.  Smooth, very drinkable.  If you like bold, dark coffee, this will please."
2422,2422,2422,2423,5,"In my office, and for me personally, this is the smoothest and best tasting coffee you can buy for your Keurig machine. Great price too!"
2423,2423,2423,2424,5,I have tried about every k cup brand....Caribou Mohogany is my all time go-to brand.  Flavorful yet not strong and no jitters.  You get the same great flavor whether you make a small cup or a large one.
2424,2424,2424,2425,5,"If you like a bold cup of good coffee...and have a Keurig single up brewer, this is the flavor to buy!  Never dissappointing with Carbou Mahogany!"
2425,2425,2425,2426,5,"i have this strong flavorful mahogany coffee by caribou in my Keurig.  I love the taste.  I do like strong coffee and this seems to be the right blend of strong to medium.  I use a vanilla diet supplement in the coffee every morning with a splash of torani sugar free syrup and there is breakfast on the move.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474VPY0"">Caribou Coffee, Mahogany, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>"
2426,2426,2426,2427,5,We love this coffee. It is the best K cup we've found. We like strong coffee and struggled at first to find one that we enjoyed. The prices on Amazon can't be beat and the shipping super fast.
2427,2427,2427,2428,4,My husband enjoyed this coffee. We usually use Newman's Extra Bold but thought we<br />would try something different. It was a bit too strong for me; I prefer Newman's. But it was<br />still good.
2428,2428,2428,2429,3,"This coffee is inoffensive, but not strong enough for my tastes.  I do use cream, and I'm sure that makes a difference."
2429,2429,2429,2430,4,"I like strong coffee, but I don't want it to taste burnt or have an acidic after taste. Caribou Coffee's Mahogany is full bodied with a nice balance of dark notes and acidity.  It's one of my ""go to"" coffees when my favorites like Coffee People's Wake Up Call are out of stock."
2430,2430,2430,2431,4,I like my coffee strong. This is the first brand that I have tasted that provides the kick I need without the bitterness. I keep my pantry stocked with Mahogony and I do not share!
2431,2431,2431,2432,5,love to order my coffee on amazon.  easy and shows up quickly.<br />This k cup is great coffee.  dcaf is very good as well
2432,2432,2432,2433,5,One of the richer coffee for k cups! We typically grind our own even for the Keurig but the Mahagoney from Caribou is a great alternative. Order was shipped very quickly.  Will definitely buy again.
2433,2433,2433,2434,5,"This is my favorite K-cup coffee (I've tried about twenty different types) and, so far, everyone I've served it to really likes it a lot. Even the pickiest coffee connoisseur I know thought this k-cup made an excellent cup of coffee. Two non-coffee drinking friends wish they liked coffee because they love the sound of Caribou Mahogany."
2434,2434,2434,2435,5,"This is a great coffee.  Its dark but not bitter, a little chocolaty, and it reminds me of an Adirondack lodge.  I can get them for a better price in a Caribou Coffee store, however."
2435,2435,2435,2436,5,"I've tried quite a few coffees and many end up tasting the same. However, this and the Italian Blend by Timothy's are two that are very good black or with cream/sugar. If you're looking for a simple coffee without all the flavors, this is the one for you."
2436,2436,2436,2437,5,"I've tried over a dozen varieties of K-Cups and this is, by far, my favorite!  It's strong but not bitter and just has a great flavor.  This will be my choice from now on."
2437,2437,2437,2438,5,"Without beating it to death - If you like a full bodied, but mellow brew this might be for you.  It is hearty, but not at all bitter.  It holds a nice full body, even when the Keurig is set to the oversize setting.  It's now my favorite blend."
2438,2438,2438,2439,5,I go for the bold varieties of coffee and this Mahogany is not only bold but very smooth.  My all time favorite!
2439,2439,2439,2440,5,"So Far this is the only K-cup I've found thats tastes great with a normal brew!  It's not watered down like the regular stuff, and dosen't taste burnt like the bold stuff. They only K-cup i'm buying from now on!"
2440,2440,2440,2441,5,"We've tried every coffee brand available for the Keurig, and this one is, by far, the best.  It's extraordinarily smooth and rich - the closest to Starbucks, if that's your thing.  I add to it a healthy splash of Bolthouse coffee/mocha - very good."
2441,2441,2441,2442,5,The Mahogany has a smooth full bodied character.  I highly recommend this coffee to drinkers looking for a bold but not overpowering taste!
2442,2442,2442,2443,3,"This coffee is not really bold in my opinion - it falls more along medium roast flavor. It's a decent, smooth coffee, but I didn't think really bold. Like all k-cups though seriously overpriced!"
2443,2443,2443,2444,1,"If you like strong coffee, as I do this coffee is over rated. I found it weak, with a sickening after  taste."
2444,2444,2444,2445,3,"This coffee is very full bodied, and has a great aroma; however, it is the only K-Cup coffee I've had that has a bitter aftertaste. I would still drink it if someone offered me a cup, but I won't buy it again."
2445,2445,2445,2446,5,This was sold out at Cafe Express site.  Thrilled to<br />Find it here. Quick delivery and great service!  Happy to know that I can find it here.
2446,2446,2446,2447,5,"My favorite blend of my favorite coffee.  Used to have to smuggle a few pounds of the stuff back in my suitcase everytime I went out to the midwest! Now I can get in k-cups.  Yay! Good price on amazon, but super saver shipping takes forever! Fedexing it to the post office makes no sense.  just fedex it to me and shave 2 days off the wait already!"
2447,2447,2447,2448,4,"This coffee is very smooth but rather flat compared to Starbuck's brews.  It doesn't have any bite to it.<br />If you like a mild coffee, you will enjoy this one."
2448,2448,2448,2449,1,"Honestly, I'm not sure why so many folks like this coffee in their reviews.  It's a little weak but mostly just doesn't have a rich flavor.  It is really missing something.  I drink coffee black.  Maybe it tastes better with cream and sugar?  Before buying this coffee, I had been drinking Starbuck's French Roast and Folger's Black Silk, both of which taste SO MUCH better than this coffee."
2449,2449,2449,2450,5,"Let me be honest, I wasn't expecting this to be very good. I received a sample and it sat in the fridge for a good week before I was brave enough to give it a taste.<br /><br />At first sip, it was much sweeter than I expected it to be. I could certainly taste the pineapple, but the coconut flavor was much more pronounced than I thought it would be. It was good! I very much enjoyed the taste of the drink. It was exotic and refreshing. It was much fuller in weight, as I was thinking it would be watery with a mild flavor.<br /><br />The box reminded me of those chocolate milks that I buy for my kids, but it didn't detract from the flavor."
2450,2450,2450,2451,5,"I have been buying ONE Coconut Water with a Splash of Pineapple regularly for awhile now. I like the flavor and ordering it on line is very convenient. Also, I have had no problems with delivery.<br /><br />Unfortunately, IPROZON has just lost my business.  I didn't mind paying $15.00 for a case of 12.  I will not, however, pay $39.95 for a case of 12.  That is robbery.  I can walk into Fred Meyer Grocery and buy a case of 12 for $17.88.  Plus there are other sites still selling it for $15.00 per case.  I noticed IPROZON is still selling the other flavors of ONE coconut water for $15.00 for a case of 12.  So what on earth are they thinking.<br /><br />I am quite unhappy with having to trust one of these other sites with my credit card information, but I am willing to do that versus paying nearly $40 for a case of 12.  Quite ridiculous."
2451,2451,2451,2452,5,"I was exhausted, hot, and dehydrated when I spotted this in a concourse store at JFK airport.  I was about to get on a 6 hour flight and water sounded too unsatisfying - but juice sounded too heavy.<br />I'd heard the rumblings about coconut water so I looked to see if I liked any of the flavor options - I can't stand mango and just about everyone adds it. I was relieved to see the O.N.E. coconut water with a ""splash of pineapple"" so I figured I'd give it a go.<br />The woman at the counter said ""are you sure you want that? It's $4."" Steep! But it's an airport, what can you do? By that point I was so wanting to try it I said sure.  After all, it would've been $3 for a sticky sweet soda.<br />I was so happy with it that I kept the empty tetra pack with me the whole time I traveled so I would know which one it was.  It doesn't taste heavy (in case the pina colada reference made it sound that way) but the pineapple takes the edge off the green coconut water.  It's amazing.<br />I was happy to find it on Amazon - as I'm definitely hooked.<br />Since I have Prime shipping, it gets to me in 2 days (if I order it right, that is!) which saves me a trip to various local stores trying to see who still has it in stock.<br />I'm totally thrilled with this stuff."
2452,2452,2452,2453,3,"We loved this product and I just received my new order.  I noticed the packing changed which made me check the label.  The ingredients and NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION HAS CHANGED!<br /><br />Old Ingredients & Nutrition (sample)<br />Natural Coconut Water<br />Natural Pineapple Juice<br />Cane Juice<br />Vit C.<br />Natural Fruit Flavor<br />Sodium 115mg<br />Potassium 299mg<br />Sugar 16g<br />Vit C 172%<br />Calcium 1.3%<br />Iron 1.8%<br /><br />New Ingredients & Nutrition (sample)<br />Coconut Water<br />Pineapple Juice<br />Sugar<br />Ascorbic Acid<br />Natural Flavor<br />Sodium 45mg<br />Potassium 425mg<br />Sugar 20g<br />Calcium 2%<br />Iron 0%<br />Magnesium 2%<br />Vit C 210%<br />96% Juice<br /><br />Maybe the new box is misprinted as it says 96% juice and the packaging clearly says ""a splash of pineapple and other natural flavors"".<br /><br />No thank you...I'll be cancelling my subscription.  I don't why the change."
2453,2453,2453,2454,1,Please contact the manufacturer and ask them to change back to the old formula if you love this product! We just cancelled our subscription of 8 cases per month because the new formula is disgusting! Not buying again unless the change back to the old version!
2454,2454,2454,2455,5,O. N. E. Coconut water is delicious and refreshing. It is amazing how it rids me of cramps in my calves and lower back.
2455,2455,2455,2456,5,"This drink is perfect for the summer. It is a healthy alternative to soda, and a great way to hydrate your body. I know this isn't the ""healthiest"" coconut water on the market (it does have cane sugar), but it's the best one for those who are new to coconut water, or just don't prefer something as natural as pure coconut water. My brother hates coconut water,but loves this stuff. This drink is not too sweet,and has the perfect balance of pureed pineapple and natural coconut water subtly mixed together. I like vita coco's fruit infused waters as well, but find that this drink is a lot smoother in texture, and slightly more refreshing on a hot summer day."
2456,2456,2456,2457,5,I happen to like foods that arent as sweet as kool aid or other sugary drinks. Very refreshing after mowing the lawn and helped  keep those afternoon headaches away.
2457,2457,2457,2458,5,I got the O.N.E. Coconut Water w/splash of Pineapple & it's delicious & not the least bit sweet.  Just very refreshing!!  LOVE IT and will continue using it.  Saw this on Dr. Oz as he recommended it.
2458,2458,2458,2459,5,"I saw this item in my local grocery store, and I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />I have to admit, I was very surprised about how much I enjoyed this item.  I found it refreshing, and I felt that I had a bit more energy. I would happily purchase this product again and again.<br /><br />A word of advice to people complaining that it doesn't taste ""coconutty"" enough.  Coconut water and coconut milk are two very different things.  Coconut water comes from a green, immature coconut, while the milk comes from what we all think of when we think of a coconut...a hard, brown, fiber covered shell.  Just like a green banana and a ripe banana taste different, the same can be said of coconut.  If you don't think of this as a coconut drink or a pina colada, you will probably enjoy it even more."
2459,2459,2459,2460,5,"This is the best drink out there!  I've always had adult acne and no matter what I took or what the dermatologist prescribed for me, it has always been so difficult to treat my acne.  I started drinking coconut water for the electrolyte benefits after my intense spinning classes but I noticed within several weeks that my face started to clear up and actually looked smoother!  Besides keeping me hydrated and my electrolytes in balance, it has improved the quality of my skin tone!  LOVE IT!!!!!!"
2460,2460,2460,2461,4,"I started drinking coconut water when it was suggested to me by a friend.  I never really loved the taste of it, but I spend a great deal of time in the desert and I just can't seem to suck down enough water without getting waterlogged, so I was excited when I found flavors.  I know that recently it's become trendy and much harder for me to find, but my friends have been drinking it for years, as has my yoga instructor, and they highly recommend it for drinking not only for sports, but also to keep hydrated.  Plus, it's done wonders for my always dry skin.<br /><br />If nothing else it's a great avoid a hangover cure if drunk before going to bed, and if your partied too much to avoid being sick it seems to work much better than Pedialyte to get your electrolytes back in balance."
2461,2461,2461,2462,5,"I admit that I fully expected to dislike this product, and approached it with a dismissive attitude - something that's this trendy can't be any good, right? well, I was wrong. The ONE coconut water is refreshing, delicious, and just barely sweet. Really wonderful stuff. The hint of pineapple adds a little bit of acidity that enhances the basic taste of the water. i bet this would make a great summer drink too, but I only had one so I didn't get tot try that. My problem now is that it's been out of stock, so I can't get more."
2462,2462,2462,2463,5,"I decided to try this although I am not a big fan of flavored waters.  It is quite refreshing and the flavors are quite vibrant and not weak as in some concoctions.  I happen to like both coconut and pineapple so there is no problem with the basic idea and both can be distinguished in the mix.  The one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition, even a splash puts it up front and center.  This added to the coconut may make it far too sweet for some.  It would certainly be a good pick me up after a workout or, in my case, after shoeveling the snow that seems to be deposited regularly this winter in the Northeast."
2463,2463,2463,2464,2,"Ugh....I tried this as a replacement for the Coconut Water with Pineapple that was available before in the automatic ship program.  This stuff is awful.  It's got added sugar, which is not needed at all and actually makes the drink taste pretty gross.  Never getting this stuff again.  (And I do love coconut water, in general, as it is a fantastic hydrator and tastier than Gatorade...well, usually.  Not this stuff.)"
2464,2464,2464,2465,5,"Being a ride leader with a bicycle club, I use coconut water (with its high Potassium and vitamin C) as an energy drink. I prefer this product to that you find in ethnic markets, because it has no added sugar and it hasn't been boiled."
2465,2465,2465,2466,5,"Coconut Water with a splash of Pineapple<br /><br />This is refreshing!  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  The coconut flavor isn't pronounced, and the pineapple isn't so overpowering that it tastes like syrup.  It's clean tasting.  According to the packaging, ""it has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives.""  There's a smidge of fiber, 0.8 g of protein and 16 g of sugars.  I suspect most of the sugar comes from the pineapple, but ""cane juice"" is one of the ingredients, too. The 8.5 fl oz carton comes to 75 calories.<br /><br />If you sign up for subscribe & save, it's less than $1 per carton.  Actually, the carton is the only thing I don't like about this drink.  It's sort of hard to drink directly from because there isn't any air getting let in when you drink, which makes a vacuum.  This was solved by pouring it into a glass.  *whew*<br /><br />This was good.  I will definitely get more, and I highly recommend this to people who like pineapple juice."
2466,2466,2466,2467,2,"Almost gagged at first taste. I have used other coconut based products (water, milk, cooking oil, etc) and this is the first time I have been disappointed. My teenage kids hated it. My son is health food nut and drinks all the protein shakes and he couldn't stand it. I am sure Done is not the healthiest, but one you try that, there is no comparison in flavor tolerance."
2467,2467,2467,2468,5,"I LOVE THIS STUFF. Really, I do. I have tried all of the flavors, but I haven't tried the original. I have to say, by far, pineapple is my favorite. Guava is a close second. Who am I kidding? I love them all!<br /><br />Despite what others say about it tasting best at room temperature, I find it tastes very refreshing and even better when on ice. If you want a natural, tasty alternative to water, this is for you."
2468,2468,2468,2469,5,"Since I had been recuperating from a 24 hour flu bug that lasted a<br />week, I knew I was low on electrolytes.  I opted for this product,<br />as some products tend to further aggravate my stomach and<br />acid reflux.  This worked out extremely well, and the taste<br />is good.  I WILL keep it on hand from now on!"
2469,2469,2469,2470,5,I have tried all the different brands of coconut water and O.N.E. is my favorite and O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pineapple is my favorite flavor. I wish the price would come back down I absolutely love this stuff!
2470,2470,2470,2471,3,"To me, this tastes more like pineapple juice than coconut.  There is an underlying hint of coconut, I know the water isn't strongly flavored, but I wasn't expecting so much pineapple.  This is tangy and sweet.  It is alright.  Package is smaller, but I don't think I could handle too much more of it in one sitting.  I am not thrilled with their unflavored coconut water, it is too tangy/sour to me, so with the pineapple it helps cover up that funkiness for me.  Not sure I'd buy this again.  Still in search of the one I first tried and fell in love with, but so far not finding anything as light and fresh tasting."
2471,2471,2471,2472,3,"I didn't expect coconut water with a splash of pineapple juice to taste quite so salty, even if it does replace electrolytes, so that was off-putting.  It's not really bad, especially over ice, but I won't be ordering any more of it."
2472,2472,2472,2473,3,"This is good but not as good as the standard coconut water in this brand.  The container is smaller, there is no straw, and I like the taste of the plain one better.  It is OK."
2473,2473,2473,2474,1,"I've had Amy and Brians coconut water - yum!, Vico's plain in the tetra pack - great! (the ones in the plastic bottle and some in the larger tetra packs are from concentrate - blah and yuck- don't get those!) , and the ones in the glass bottles- green cover- can't remember the name, but pure coconut water -great too.<br /><br />This, one with pineapple- no good.  The added cane juice is superfluous to the natural sweetness of coconut water and pineapple juice.  It makes the water taste 'thicker' and not so healthy.<br /><br />I wish these brands can just stick to the name of the drinks in their ingredients! (i.e. coconut water and pineapple juice! - no more!)"
2474,2474,2474,2475,2,"I love coconut and pineapple, but I was not wild about the ONE Coconut Water with a Splash of Pineapple. It wasn't BAD ... it had a mildly coconutty (though not sweet) flavor, but it just wasn't anything special. It was rather bland, and I had a hard time finishing it as it started to warm up. Since I'm not a competitive athlete and don't have any great need to replenish my electrolytes, I'd rather just drink water."
2475,2475,2475,2476,4,"...Then O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is the drink for you.  I found this drink to be almost overpoweringly sweet as a standalone beverage.  According to the package, O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE contains natural coconut water, natural pineapple juice, cane juice, vitamin C, and natural fruit flavor.  Personally, with the coconut and the pineapple, I think they could have left out the sugar cane.<br /><br />However, when I paired O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE with a light snack of cheese and crackers, it became a very tasty, refreshing drink.  I, apparently, needed a little salt and/or savory to make O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE completely palatable.  With the afore mentioned snack, the O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is really delightful.  I can also see it being very invigorating on a hot summer today (not so much with the cold winter weather).<br /><br />O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE comes in a handy 8.5 oz box with a place to punch a straw through.  This type of packaging is nice if you are on the go or have kids.  Just throw it in your bag and go.<br /><br />Prior to this experience, I had not heard of coconut water.  On the packaging it says ""O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is a blend of the natural water from inside a young, green coconut and sweet, golden pineapple juice. It has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives.""  Huh...who knew you could drink a green coconut?  Educational and a good source of potassium.  Being allergic to bananas, it is always good to have another source.<br /><br />Overall, I would not drink O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE by itself in the middle of winter.  But together with non-sugary snack or in the high heat of summer, I would definitely give O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE another try."
2476,2476,2476,2477,4,"This seems like a pretty straightforward drink. It's coconut juice and it's pineapple juice, with a bit of sugar and not much else.<br /><br />They claim it's a good source of potassium and electrolytes.<br /><br />For me it was pretty tasty. Granted it was also very sweet. Is it a ""health drink""? I don't know if I'd go that far. It has Vitamin C and trace amounts of Calcium / Iron, but not much else other than sugar.<br /><br />For what it is (something sweet to sip), it's pretty good."
2477,2477,2477,2478,3,"My top line advice: If you want coconut water with a touch of pineapple, get the Vita Coco, not this one.<br /><br />Size: The size is 8.5 fl oz per package. I didn't pay close attention when ordering, and expected the larger, 11.5 oz size. Not a big deal, and was my fault, but it's a little too small to be useful.<br /><br />Taste: Ick. I love coconut water. I love pineapple juice. I love lightly flavored coconut water. This tastes like none of the above. The flavor is sickly sweet (ingredients included added sugar), and with none of the nice mellow coconut flavor of other coconut waters I've tried. Might as well be a processed kids drink.<br /><br />Alternatives: While I actually prefer O.N.E.'s regular, unflavored coconut water over other brands, the Vita Coco coconut water with a splash of pineapple is far superior to this one. It comes in a larger package, doesn't have added sugar, has more vitamins and nutrients (this one is diluted with sugar water), and tastes like you're drinking it fresh on the beach. This one is just...not great."
2478,2478,2478,2479,3,"I wanted to try this juice as I'm a big fan of coconut flavoured products.  Given that it claims to have a ""splash of pineapple"", I was expecting a light pina-colada flavour.<br /><br />On opening the package, I could smell the hint of pineapple, and I'd say the taste of pineapple is a bit stronger than the coconut water.  Probably because I've mostly tasted coconut milk and not water, I'd say this was nothing like what I expected.  It's not bad for thirst quenching, but it wasn't my favourite drink in terms of taste."
2479,2479,2479,2480,3,"hi every one I just wanted to share some of my experience with you about this product. First off all it taste pretty good but its kinda sugary and salty. Its an ok drink but when you think about it and you compare it to others this drink is not as healthy as others. Its more like a juice drink than a healthy one. Compared to Vitacoco it has more calories, twice the sodium, half the potassium and almost half the vitamin C. This drink also has less magnesium, phosphorous, and 4 times less calcium. The only this the drink does have over Vitacoco is the 1 less gram of sugar. Overall pay the extra price and get a better drink for your body and if you dont believe me go to the websites and check the facts below or check it out on their web site.<br /><br />O.N.E.

2480,2480,2480,2481,2,"I'm usually into Pineapple and coconut drinks, but this drink just didn't taste all that great to me. The taste doesn't resemble anything close to a 'Pina Colada' flavor and it was actually difficult to taste the pineapple or coconut in it.  It just tastes tangy and a little sour... like water that has a bit of sugar and sour-ness to it. Yeah, not really a taste I crave. I'm not sure if everyone had this reaction to this drink, but it just didn't appeal to me. I really wanted to like it though, because as I said before... I usually love pineapple coconut drinks."
2481,2481,2481,2482,2,"This product is billed as an all natural anti-oxident and electrolyte replacing beverage.  Sort of like all-natural Gatorade with anti-oxidents.<br /><br />Like a sports beverage, it too is also kinda bland.  I love some of the Gatorade flavors, some not so much.  This drink falls into the not so much category for me.<br /><br />It is sorta sweet, sorta pineapple-y, and also sorta bland.  My wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth, like the glass had soap in it still.  I didn't think it was that bad but the drink really didn't appeal to me.<br /><br />In the end, yes, this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch.  But as a sports drink, I think I'll stick with plain old gatorade; it's cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving.<br /><br />If going the all natural route with your juices/drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to 3 stars."
2482,2482,2482,2483,2,"I received a single 8.5 once container of ONE Coconut water with a splash of Pineapple as part of the Amazon Vine program for review.<br /><br />It would have been nice if it had come with a straw, especially considering the price of the product. Now as to the ""Splash of Pineapple"", well it must not have been a very big splash, because I never did taste any pineapple. So what did I taste? It is hard to describe. It doesn't taste like coconut or cane sugar or any ""Natural Fruit flavor"".<br /><br />To be honest, it tastes like water,...sort of. Like water with an odd, undefinable extra flavor. It's not a bad flavor or a good flavor, it's just Meh! flavor. I don't care how ""healthy"" this drink is supposed to be, for it's price, it should have a better flavor, or just have a flavor.<br /><br />And as a ""thirst quencher"", it doesn't equal up to Gatorade or even a Lemonade. I feel a glass of tap water would do just as good as job to quench your thirst."
2483,2483,2483,2484,2,"Coconut water with a hint of pineapple, shipped to the US from Indonesia, packaged in (usually) non-recyclable, disposable containers, and catering to the... sports drink market (""good source of electrolytes"")?<br /><br />I took a  8.5 ounce container and poured 6 servings, for 4 teenagers and 2 adults.  First impression?  The teens (serious athletes) were not told what the drink was, but I did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink.<br /><br />The result?  No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  ""It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,"" one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.<br /><br />There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  It's mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?<br /><br />But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  What's the carbon footprint of this product?  And the container has 2 ""recycle"" symbols on it, but, like milk cartons, it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill.<br /><br />Bottom line?  It's not that tasty, being little more than sugar water, and the transport and packaging waste really don't fit into a culture (for me) focusing on sustainability."
2484,2484,2484,2485,5,"This is a close second to my all-time favorite, Jack Links Beef Steakhouse Steaks, which is the filet mignon of beef jerky. They're very similar in taste and price, but the Steakhouse edges out this one oh so slightly. Still pretty awesome jerky, very tender, and not a hint of fat or gristle. Bon appetit!"
2485,2485,2485,2486,5,"Actually, Sojo's strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw, but it an be cooked as I choose to do.  My dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy.  Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life.  After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian.  Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.<br /><br />It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.  To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.  If I was able to feed him raw (perhaps down the road, when our vet gives the ok), preparation time would  be almost nothing."
2486,2486,2486,2487,5,Sojos foods have been tested for nutritional content and they are all formulated to have a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.4:1. You do not need to add calcium or phosphorus.
2487,2487,2487,2488,5,"I feed my dogs Sojos as part of a mixed bowl of quality kibble and quality canned food.  I recommend Sojos.<br /><br />But I had a problem with the Amazon purchase.  Amazon stored the Sojos bag in the original mailing box Sojos sent them.  My order was picked from the shelf and the box containing the Sojos was placed in another box and mailed to me.  The bag of Sojos was almost one year old and there was no way Amazon kept track of that.  I got a refund from Amazon with no question and very quickly, but Amazon needs to keep control of the ""use-by"" dates of food they offer on their site."
2488,2488,2488,2489,5,"I have three Newfoundlands so we go through a lot of food!  One of the dogs has had severe health issues and since we've switched from commercial kibble to home made food, he's thrived!  He gets regular blood tests to monitor the drugs he's on and they have been perfect since we started on Sojos!  It will not cure his issues, but he has more energy and he can't wait for meal time!  The other two are glowing with health as well!  All three dogs coats are shiny and they have tons of energy (for a Newf!)"
2489,2489,2489,2490,4,I think this is a great product but my picky dog gets tired of it after a week.
2490,2490,2490,2491,5,My small mixed breed is a picky eater but he seems to like solos so long as I mix it with some good people food. He hasnt had problems digesting it  Delivery was prompt as expected.
2491,2491,2491,2492,5,"I have a now 8 month old male Shih Tzu.  When I brought him home from the breeder, I kept him on the 'Pro Plan Puppy' tiny dry kibble until the bag was almost finished.  There was about 2 cups left in the bag and he began walking away from his bowl as soon as I put it down.  As a test, I rolled a few morsels across the tile floor in the kitchen to see what would happen...he'd eat about 10 pieces and go bring me one of his squeaker toys to play with. (Which I was happy with, as I don't want to 'play' with his food as a game to get him to eat).  I went and got him Blue Buffalo dry puppy food (lamb and oatmeal formula), which had bigger size kibbles.  It seemed that he liked the bigger sized items to chew on and the harder antioxidant bits, since he was teething and chewing on his dentabones, venison antler, lamb lung chips for comfort.  Again when I got down to about a quarter of food left in the bag, he would walk away from the bowl---this went on for almost 3 days.  He was still having small bowel movements, urinating, drinking water and playing, running and continuing his successful training exercises; called the vet and they wanted to give me wet venison formula by Science Diet/Veterinarian's Diet after the exam, which showed nothing physically wrong.  The one vet tech said that Shih Tzu's tend to be picky eaters.  I didn't pick up the food at their check out counter, left and began some of my own research into the breed itself and a more natural diet.  I know from some of our outdoor excursions that he's attracted to road kill (he'll sniff the air, and want to lunge for it and would probably eat it if left to his own devices...but I won't allow it).  I remember being a kid in the late 60's early 70's and all my friends who had dogs fed them 1 of 2 choices available back then: Gravy Train or Alpo and they mixed meat or the drippings from the meat; they ate bones, etc and all lived into their late teens.  One of my friends small mutt lived to be 24 years old!!!  I never saw these dogs itching or digging at themselves other than the usual ears or if their was a flea problem, since I grew up in a rural area and most often that was a common occurrance.  Well, I read up on the more natural diets and decided to get the Sojos and ground beef and some boneless chicken thighs/breasts.  My Weston isn't a big fan of totally raw meat, but when browned (I put it in the toaster oven and add 1/4 tsp of 'Missing Link' to the meat portion) with the soaked Sojos Original, he eats with gusto!!!  From his early days, I would play with and take his food away, so he's not food aggressive.  He eats the recommended portion for his size and walks away when done.  Weston then wants to play hard, train hard, take a nice walk and nap.  His coat is soft and easy to keep brushed and groomed.  The droppings are nice sized and easy to clean up.  I just had him neutered 2 days ago and he ate this Sojos mix with the same gusto (even with the e-collar to challenge him).  So I am a fan and we are finished with the second 2.5 lb bag and I just ordered another one.  Hope this helps someone with a picky eater; I know another reviewer mentioned their Shih Tzu not liking it, but this shows you that dogs have certain tastes different from each other, much like us humans."
2492,2492,2492,2493,4,I didn't mean to order a 40-pound bag. But I did. Wow. That's a lot of food. Be sure to mix it with protein or else you dog will suffer a bit of internal distress.
2493,2493,2493,2494,1,"Sojo's diet lacks calcium, and if fed as directed will cause severe metabolic bone disease in your dog.  This diet requires supplementation with a balanced calcium/phosphorous additive to be safe."
2494,2494,2494,2495,5,"I was introduced to these very small doggie bones at my Vet.  My 14 year old Springer who has never been much into doggie bones LOVES these things!!  They make great pocket stuffers to carry around for incentive and motivation.  My old guy has a hard time waking up to go outside and one wiff of one of these bones does miracles.  I have a younger Springer who also loves the bones but she doesn't need much motivation to do anything, ha, but they are also great training aids.  I also sent home a handful of these bones with a painter I had at my home for his 3 dogs and he said they loved them too....so I guess that's antidotal but that's 5 dogs that really love the things!  Oh, the bones are way more expensive when you find them at your Vet, about twice as much per pound, so this is a great buy.  Buy a nice food safe container from Home Depot and fill it up.  You won't run out of bones for a while and that's a good thing!"
2495,2495,2495,2496,3,"It doesn't have a whole lot of flavor, but most light roasts don't.  It does have a unique flavor, but is kind of rich and tiring, so I recommend you mix it with other coffees to make it taste better and make you other bland coffees taste a little better."
2496,2496,2496,2497,4,"It seems most of the organic/shade grown/fair trade coffee is medium or dark roasted, so I've been having a hard time finding something that I like.  While this doesn't wow me like some other coffees, it's priced cheaper than those coffees and it's a good brew for when I'm not really paying attention to what I'm drinking (like when I'm working).<br /><br />I'm definitely going to keep this one around, and just switch to the expensive (better) coffees that I've found when I can really enjoy them.<br /><br />Compared to other coffee that's not organic/shade grown/fair trade, this is an average light roast.  Good, but nothing to get excited over.  It's worth purchasing over those coffees because of the growing practices."
2497,2497,2497,2498,5,"I recently moved and couldn't find a thai restaurant nearby. My favorite meal at my old thai place was massaman curry. I used the recipe on the back on the package when I got it, and it was JUST like what I get at the restaurant! Excellent flavor!"
2498,2498,2498,2499,5,"We love to get Masaman curry at our local Thai restaurant, but I haven't been able to find a paste that actually tastes like it.  This paste does, and is very easy to prepare.  Just add some coconut milk and heat - add your protein and veggies of choice, done!  I have now bought some of the other Mae Ploy products, and found them all very good quality with authentic flavors."
2499,2499,2499,2500,5,This is really delicious and not something you can find in the local grocery store.  If you did it would be very expensive and a much smaller quantity.  This is a good deal and super easy to use.
2500,2500,2500,2501,2,"this paste is actually what first got me into thai curry, at the time i loved it, made it all the time, then i discovered a better brand of curry paste, hand brand curry paste, premium stuff, amazon doesn't sell :(, hint to amazon, stock it, but you can get it at [...], its based in seattle and they import everything from thailand, the flavor of hands brand is so much better the mae ploy, a huge difference, i went back to mae ploy after having hand brand and i didnt even finish my meal, very bland, boring by comparison, also as a side note, these are very small containers, i was used to buy the large ones at my local asian store, these are like 1/4 the size of those ones. not a good deal if you can find it locally."
2501,2501,2501,2502,5,"I ordered this product to send to my friend's husband. They had just moved to Alabama in the end of March, she could not find ANY Diet Peach Snapple that tasted the same as what they had bought up here in New Jersey. He said that the water that was used down South made the Diet Peach Snapple taste different ! So, now she is happy because she has found  a source that they can buy his Snapple from ! Thank you."
2502,2502,2502,2503,5,"This peach flavored diet tea by Snapple is extremely refreshing after a long summer's day! It's truly a diet tea--there are zero calories. It's best served chilled; and it has a mild but not overwhelming peach flavor to it that is just right. Snapple makes this with green and black tea leaves; there's also a mild green tea flavor mixed in with the peach flavoring. They use filtered water as well. This tea is sweetened somewhat with Aspartame; but Snapple adds in just the right amount so that it's not excessively sweet. If you want really tea that is rather sweet, you'll either have to look further or use this with added sweetener. It also contains phenylalanine and it is kosher if these are dietary concerns for you.<br /><br />If you have other questions, the company has a toll free number so that people can contact them.<br /><br />Overall, this tea is perfect for a hot summer's day when you want something cool to refresh yourself and whet your whistle. I highly recommend this product."
2503,2503,2503,2504,5,"Previously I bought some mustard seed that was unbearably bitter, but the mustard I made with this seed is very tasty and (after mellowing a few days) not bitter at all. Pleasantly spicy."
2504,2504,2504,2505,4,"In my quest to find snacks that are not empty calorie types, this is one of my new favorites.  Great taste, and although a hefty calorie count, the decent amount of protein makes this a good choice for eating on the run, if a real meal just is not an option!  VERY satisfying.  I also tried the white sesame crunch, and that is ok too, but this one wins for taste."
2505,2505,2505,2506,5,"Mrs. May's pumpkin crunch is a great snack. For those of you watching calories and intake, be aware that the 2oz portions are two servings. Most of Mrs. May's products are great, but with the fat at 11g per serving, i find it's not a complete guilt free snack. However, the pumpkin seed crunch has 9gms of protein per serving vs. the usual 4gms in their other snacks. So if you're monitoring your intake and want to indulge in these now and then, the pumpkin seed crunch is the healthiest option of the bunch.<br /><br />That said, they are all tasty and certainly not bad for you, just a little high in fat if you're watching your weight."
2506,2506,2506,2507,5,I love to put a bag of Pumpkin Crunch on the table at work and watch people's faces light up when they taste them.  Try it.
2507,2507,2507,2508,5,Mrs. May's Pumpkin Crunch is the best of the bunch.  If you like pumpkin seeds this is for you.  The slightly sweet cubes make me think I am eating cake.  These are great for snacking and even dessert. A truly wonderful product and gluten-free into the bargain!

I used them, and wasn't the least bit disappointed.<br /><br />I paired the cake with Pilsbury's Pink Lemonade frosting, too. But you could have it totally un-frosted if you'd like! You will still love it!<br /><br />Perfect for the family dessert, children's cupcakes, or a lovely addition to the ladies afternoon tea! If you love pink lemonade you are going to love this!<br /><br />The color just screams Spring and Easter! And the taste will leave you screaming for another bite!<br /><br />I give this 5-stars and my thumbs up!"
2511,2511,2511,2512,5,"I normally bake from scratch but when I saw this pink lemonade cake mix with matching frosting I just had to try them both. This cake can be made two ways: with or without egg yolks. I recommend with as the cake will be nice and moist as a result. This cake would also be just as good with plain white icing or just a dusting of powdered sugar. You can make it as a layer, bundt, or sheet cake, or as cupcakes. I picked it up at the grocery store recently for about $1.80 per box, the frosting was about the same price per can. I ended up going back and purchasing more for later as I believe this is just a seasonal flavor and Pillsbury will pull it from the market at some point. If they do I hope they bring it back every spring. Until then I'll be stocking up."
2512,2512,2512,2513,5,"Like I said about the icing....I am so happy to be able to buy this online. It is a family favorite, it also was shipped on time and arrived early. Definitely going to buy again."
2513,2513,2513,2514,5,"I picked up a box of this in a discount grocery store in paso robles. The cake was heavenly. I liked it so much, I found another store that sold the mix as well as the icing, and there is even a pink lemonade cookie mix which I bought but haven't tried yet.<br /><br />The taste, is of course lemon, but it reminds me a bit of that flavored mix Country Time I drank as a kid, but less tangy. Its very light and refreshing.<br /><br />I simply loved it. Hope this is more than just a seasonal flavor."
2514,2514,2514,2515,5,I tried the cookies and they were great nd trying to find them in the stores<br />with no success. did not realize they were seasonal or would have stocked up<br />great product
2515,2515,2515,2516,5,"This is a great product, so it's no surprise that the local shelves are often cleared of it, especially early in the season. Purchasing in bulk through amazon.com is a dependable alternative. Bayer 2-in-1 in granular form feeds roses and flowers while protecting them with a systemic insecticide for up to 6 weeks, but you'll need a separate fungicidal/disease treatment, and the systemic would not be something one would apply to anything edible. Bayer assures me the product is safe for pollinators and earthworms."
2516,2516,2516,2517,5,"I have been a rose Gardner for many years, I remember when this product was made by Ortho and called Rose Pride.  This product really helps with the pests and diseases that roses tend to acquire.  Though it does not stop all pests (cane borers) it stops the major ones that cause serious damage and spread disease.  I treat all my plants on the same monthly regiment and make sure to do it every four to six weeks making a note on my calendar.  Like one other reviewer said you will not see immediate results with this since it is systemic.  For the best results make sure to read the package and work the granules  into the soil and water in."
2517,2517,2517,2518,5,"I have been plagued by white flies for over a year. Neither chemical nor natural treatment has gotten rid of them completely. I decided to try this as it's made by a respected international brand & I thought a systemic product might work.<br />A week after the first application there was no reduction in infestation but by the second week I started to notice less & less of the little vermin. By the time I was ready to do a third application there was not even one white fly or any other insect on any of my roses or any other shrub. I had even used it on potted plants which were also infested & it worked on everything.<br />Remember, the product is systemic and is absorbed gradually into the plant so you will not see an immediate improvement but it works wonderfully.  Also if like me, you don't always remember to spray regularly or get the underneaths of the leaves, then something which you can sprinkle at the base of the plant every 6-8 weeks is certainly a lot easier to use."
2518,2518,2518,2519,1,"There's one important thing not mentioned on their label and that it is NOT for use in containers! Why hide that info? To make more sales, of course. You'll only learn that if you read their Q & A on their website. I studied the labels and opened the back label and it's never mentioned you can't use it on potted plants. Thanks Bayer...now I have to go back to the store to return it. I guess a lot of people have wondered why their potted flowers or roses died, not knowing it's because of this product. If you see your bees dwindle and disappear, then this is the reason. Will systemic products affect your fragrance of your flowers? After 3-4 years of use, they will not have a fragrance. Got earthworms? You wouldn't know unless you thoroughly dug through your dirt. AVOID THIS!"
2519,2519,2519,2520,3,"The active ingredient in this sytemic is imidacloprid.  It is adbsorbed by the rose plant into the leaves, but not the flowers I learned recently online.  I have been using this stuff for years and obseved this, but put it down to my not giving the plant enough granules.  Unless you SPRAY the flowers with another product containing the insecticide, the Japanese beetles devour the rose flowers and leave th leaves alone.<br /> see link<br />[...]"
2520,2520,2520,2521,5,Works wonderfully for most all applications in the garden. Could not be easier since it is systemic and helps fertilize only what you want to fertilize.
2521,2521,2521,2522,1,"If I could give this product a minus 10 stars, I would.  There is now very strong evidence that chlothianidin which is in this product is one of the pesticides that is affecting honeybees and contributing to colony collapse disorder.  This US has yet to ban this pesticide, but it has already been banned in other countries. Avoid this product and any others containing clothianidin."
2522,2522,2522,2523,5,"These chips are good to sprinkle on salad, use in cookies and baking and sprinkle on cereal.  Very pleased."
2523,2523,2523,2524,5,This is the best mustard. my husband loves it on his sandwiches for work. it has the right spices and taste to enhance what you are eating. Have been looking for it in bigger tubes with not much luck but any size is great.
2524,2524,2524,2525,5,"This is the best I've ever eaten.  If you like mustard and you like<br />horseradish this is the product to try.<br />My first experience with Thomy was several years ago when my Son lived<br />in Germany.  He used to send it home, but after he moved back to the<br />States the supply was cut off.  But when you notified me that it was<br />available, I was ecstatic.<br />The blend is delicious, and goes well with your favorite crackers and<br />cheese appetizers or with anything you enjoy with mustard.  It adds<br />that little zing.<br />Give it a try, you won't be sorry."
2525,2525,2525,2526,5,"This mustard is NOT for the mild-mannered, but for those who truly appreciate great German food!  This product is original as sauer kraut und rot Kohl!  Its taste is very original and authentic for those who will appreciate a bit of zip in their mustard.  Try it on brats, burgers (etc.), and you simply won't be disappointed.  Alles Gute!  Jim"
2526,2526,2526,2527,5,"There isn't much to say about this mustard other than ""Ummm Ummm Good!!!""  I tried this for the first time at a BBQ on a salmon burger and it truly brought the flavor out of the meat...now I use it on everything from chicken burgers to homemade Caesers dressing!  You'll love it!!!"
2527,2527,2527,2528,5,"Great with bratwurst, breakfast sausages, salami, cheddar cheese, sandwiches, etc., even though it is a bit exotic/expensive to use with sandwiches where it tends to fade into the background, it's best to keep it simple and let it stand out."
2528,2528,2528,2529,5,"It arrived on time and was packaged well.  This was my first try of this mustard.  It was unique, similar to many other hot mustards, but I favored it over the others I have because of the balance of flavors.  It's almost as hot as English (Coleman's) mustard, but a little sweeter and maybe a slight vinegar essence in it. The tube and a bag of pretzels lasted me one or two evenings."
2529,2529,2529,2530,5,We became acquainted with this mustard when we were in Switzerland and really enjoyed it. That was our reason for purchasing it. Great find!! We have liked this as much as the one that we bought in Europe!
2530,2530,2530,2531,5,"The Lobster Bisque is absolutely delicious. Nice lobster flavor; I cannot imagine what you could possibly add to improve the taste of this soup. Just open, heat and enjoy. I've become such a fan of the Baxter's line that I can't wait to try them all."
2531,2531,2531,2532,5,"Baxters soups are usually very nice, but the lobster bisque is especially good. It tastes authentic, it has a good flavour, is creamy, and has just enough lobster bits to make it interesting. Add some fresh black pepper and a dash of brandy or sherry and it rivals soup served in a very good restaurant.<br /><br />It's also surprisingly low calorie. Though the nutrition info here says 130 calories for 8oz, the label actually says 120 calories, so even if you ate the whole can for lunch you would consume only about 220 calories."
2532,2532,2532,2533,5,"No doubt about it this is just the right combination of Lobster, scampi, prawns with a hint of Dry white wine & a dash of brandy finish this soup to perfection.<br />Ingredients<br />Water, Lobster (4%), Cod (3.5%), Scampi (2.5%), Concentrated Tomato Paste, Modified Cornflour, White Wine, Prawns (1.5%), Skimmed Milk Powder, Butterfat, Double Cream, Salt, Yeast Extract, Sugar, Shrimp Powder, Fish Powder, Vegetable Oil, Vegetable Extracts, Stabiliser (Polyphosphates), Brandy, Concentrated Lemon Juice, Spices, Herb and Spice Extracts with celery.<br />*No Artificial Colours<br />*No Artificial Flavours<br />*No Artificial Preservatives<br /><br />Information<br />Gluten Free<br />Contains: MILK, FISH, SHELLFISH, CELERY."
2533,2533,2533,2534,2,"The taste is good, but I found myself biting down on small bits of lobster shells more often than acceptable. This made me not want to finish my bowl of soup."
2534,2534,2534,2535,3,"This soup is very good tasting if you like seafood, like I do. I am finally finishing my case of cans, because it is good food. However, I do not plan on getting any more of this particular product because every can has a little something extra: bits and pieces of chitinous shell, mostly from the shrimp but also a few hard pieces now and then from the lobster. They are small pieces, which means taking small spoonfuls and not biting down hard on anything, and don't eat the last spoonful. I find six to eight pieces of this debris in each can. Like I said before, I am finishing the case, because it is food and pretty good at that. But I just don't appreciate having to be that careful with my soup."
2535,2535,2535,2536,2,"It is ok soup, but I expected more, as I love lobster bisque and tried so many different kinds in different places. This one is very watery and I could not find any lobster there. I guess it is ok for the price, but I would NEVER buy this brand of the lobster bisque again."
2536,2536,2536,2537,4,"This was actually a gift to my daughter (along with 3 cases of other Baxter's soups). She's of the opinion that Baxter's is absolutely the BEST canned soup on the Planet (of the soups she's tasted, which include the major American brands - she doesn't cook much). The Lobster Bisque rated just below Baxter's Scottish Smoked Salmon (which she rated the BEST EVER). (From my own perspective, and usually cooking my own food, I have to admit that the Baxter's soup line, for canned soup, is superior)."
2537,2537,2537,2538,3,"For canned soup, it hits the spot decently.  There's definitely some lobster flavor and small chunks in it.  However, the whole thing tastes a little on the fishy side.  If I was served this in a restaraunt I think I'd walk out."
2538,2538,2538,2539,1,"I gave this product a one because zero wasn't an option.  This is like a can of generic tomato soup with some overcooked bits of fish scraps in it.  The only lobster in the soup was some shell.  It was salty, fishy, nasty and inedible.  Not only that, but 11 of the 12 cans were dented.  A complete waste of money.  Beyond disappointing.  It made me angry."
2539,2539,2539,2540,4,"This soup is pretty good, not great! I put some heavy cream (1-2 oz) and some Tabasco in it. I have had a lot better Lobster Bisque - But at a much higher price..."
2540,2540,2540,2541,1,Saw this soup in the supermarket and bought a can. Opened can. Heated soup. Tasted soup. Dumped soup down drain. Rinsed mouth with mouthwash. Enough said.
2541,2541,2541,2542,3,"As someone who lives and dies by seafood I've had my fair share of lobster bisque. This stuff, while not completely horrible, needs some love before it's decent. The texture isn't quite there, not thin enough to be soup but not up to bisque level either. As for the taste, it's rather bad. A little on the bland side. As a Marylander I reached for the one thing that fixes all things seafood, Old Bay. Dumped in a liberal amount and stirred while still on the heat. The Old Bay added a nice taste that made it tolerable to eat. Doubt I'll be purchasing this brand again though."
2542,2542,2542,2543,2,"As far as canned soups go this is ok. I was disappointed with the texture, extra unexpected bits (shell pieces) and overall quality. Having been spoiled by living in Maine for 20 years before relocating to the south, I tried different brands of canned bisque. I have come to the realization that Lobster Bisque is best when made fresh."
2543,2543,2543,2544,1,"This is one of the worse tasting soups I've ever eaten. I hated it, and now I have a full case.  It tastes bitter to me, and my husband wouldn't even try it.  Only my cat was trying to reach it on the counter!"
2544,2544,2544,2545,3,"I advise you to do your own web search to determine how the health risk could affect you. The tomally functions as the lobster's liver and pancreas. However, even in the cold Scottish waters, dioxin and other harmful agents have been present and there are warnings for the general public. I was disappointed to discover this information, so I only ordered the mushroom and seafood flavors."
2545,2545,2545,2546,5,"In Europe, you find a bowl of dark flaxseeds to the side of the muesli set out on a breakfast buffet. A great source of Omega-3 oil, you can improve your health by eating these tasty, nutty seeds. They are good for the gut and good for the heart.<br /><br />The golden seeds are an attractive alternative to the nut-brown seeds. They look nice in baked goods like lighter breads. They taste the same as the dark seeds. Ground, they don't show up in white bread, so you can bust some up in the blender and throw then into your standard bread recipe and add needed nutrients and fiber.<br /><br />We like them sprinkled on oatmeal, muesli or yogurt."
2546,2546,2546,2547,5,"I've been taking flaxseeds for several years due to the health benefits. I was excited to see such a great price on these from a reputable company. These are the best tasting flaxseeds I have ever had. To get the maximum health benefits you have to finely grind them in a standard coffee grinder. We usually grind 2 tablespoons per person twice a day and then add them to lemonade, crystal light, or tea and drink it down quick before it expands. Flaxseeds are loaded with minerals, vitamins, amino acids, and fiber. They are excellent for weight loss and work well for chronic constipation. There are several web sites out there that can tout the health benefits of flaxseeds but unfortunately it's against the review guidelines to post links so I'll just suggest to those of you wanting more information to search google."
2547,2547,2547,2548,5,"Flaxseed is a great way to get fiber in your diet and this brand delivers.  It has a mild taste (I put 3 tablespoons in my morning smoothie) and gives you 36% of your daily fiber required intake.  Flaxseed also contain Omega 3 so you also place a powerhouse of nutrients in your diet with this little seed.<br /><br />An excellent source of protein, fiber, and minerals such as magnesium and copper- how can you go wrong?"
2548,2548,2548,2549,5,"It's best to buy flaxseeds as opposed to flaxseed oil or meal because you get more omega3. Since you are grinding the seeds yourself, the released omega 3 oils are at their freshest.<br /><br />I recommend storing these flaxseeds in the freezer. You can keep them there after you open them as well. I grind 2 tablespoons in a coffee grinder and then add it to yogurt or a protein shake. Good stuff!"
2549,2549,2549,2550,5,"Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseeds are an excellent way to ingest some Omega 3.  96 ounces are delivered in 4 packs, and if you don't use it all immediately I suggest storing the seeds in the freezer to keep them fresh.  Grind them right before you use them, and they have a mild taste -- milder than brown flaxseed. I've ordered this product several times, and the quality has been consistently high."
2550,2550,2550,2551,5,Good product. But remember that you need some way of grinding because apparently we can't digest whole flaxseeds.
2551,2551,2551,2552,5,This is funny I bought the flax seed to make  a neck warmer  I made said to use Flax seed and warm in Microwave for 2 minutes.  Bought 4 bags only needed 2 so decided to make use of the rest. Grind and put over any food the benifits are great.<br />I put mine in Yogert and Cereal. Will diffently keep useing. After this last bag will be ording again.
2552,2552,2552,2553,5,"I enjoy this flaxseed in everything I've tried it in so far. This product has a pleasant flavor, yet doesn't over power the foods I put it in. It helps to keep my digestive track regular. I ground it in my coffee grinder and just sprinkle it on just about everything. My husband and I love it in pancakes. I enjoy it in my cereals and even on ice cream. I especially like it mixed in my yogurt. I highly recommend this product."
2553,2553,2553,2554,5,"I ordered this flaxseed after reading how good ground flaxseed was for you.  I ordered a grinder, both were reasonably priced, and the grinding was so easily accomplished.  I have been using flaxseed daily since that time, and the claims made on the Internet have proven to be true.  The product arrived on time and in great shape--I have purchased from this vendor several times, and have not been disappointed."
2554,2554,2554,2555,5,"I've recently started drinking green smoothies to get healthier and had read that flax seeds have terrific health benefits such as lowering your blood pressure and cholesterol. I add a tablespoon of chia seed and flax seed to my smoothies every day and since drinking my fruits and vegetables I feel better, lost some weight and have stopped having heart flutters. I'm now looking forward to having my next blood work done to see how well it has helped. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to get healthy an all natural way!"
2555,2555,2555,2556,5,Bought this as a way to take in omega 3 nutrient. The pack of 4 has lasted me almost a  year. You have to grind up the seeds and freeze the rest. No complaints; very reasonable pricing.
2556,2556,2556,2557,5,We are VERY happy with these Organic Golden Flaxseeds.  We grind them and put them in so many things plus they make a great topping for yogurt and cereal in the whole seed form.  These are now a staple in our house.
2557,2557,2557,2558,5,I have very little to say about the product except that it is a GREAT product and their delivery subscription works very well.
2558,2558,2558,2559,5,Great for you! Grind them up and add a few tablespoons. Can't tell it's there in your cereal ect..
2559,2559,2559,2560,3,"I have bought ground flax in the store, there was always a rancid aftertaste.  This is the best tasting flax I have ever had.  BUT, I have to throw it in the coffee grinder, and then pick out little rocks that are barely bigger than the seeds.  I found this out the hard way after using the seeds whole.  Nothing like working a bite trying to find where the rock you just bit is.<br /><br />After you grind, sift the powder and black stones will be evident.  I have about 1-2 per quarter cup of ground mixture.  Perhaps this is something you organic foodies are used to, I am not.<br /><br />I have only used 1 bag so far, so I cannot comment on whether or not the stones are in the others, but I highly doubt it was a fluke bag."
2560,2560,2560,2561,5,"This brand always makes good products, since you buy bulk they turn out to be quite cheaper than in the supermarket. very clean flaxseeds. I add it to my smoothies to bath my joints with some natural raw omegas, supposedly they are better if eaten sprouted, though haven't tried it."
2561,2561,2561,2562,5,"These Flaxseeds are of good quality, I eat them daily.  Bought the whole seed, rather than the ground seed, because of the better nutritional value of grinding your own.  Will buy again.  I read that whole seeds can pass undigested, and that ground seeds can loose their nutritional value over time.  So we grind a week's worth at a time.  Best used in oatmeal as the flavors blend well.  Or in a cold cereal, or added to a cup of coffee for a twist. Seem to blend better in hot foods."
2562,2562,2562,2563,2,"I wasn't thrilled because I had to pick out tiny bits of gravel. The flax seeds themselves were fine, top quality. If it weren't for the gravel bits (that get through the sieve w/the seeds, I guess?), this would get 5 stars."
2563,2563,2563,2564,5,"It's also a routine baking ingredient. I put it into my bread along with sunflower seeds and organic wheat flour. I also put it into my smoothie, stir fry dishes....anything you can think of! Good price and really, it's a must have for a healthy diet!"
2564,2564,2564,2565,5,Looks fresh and clean; I have roasted it in the toaster oven and I also use it in food whole or ground up in the coffee grinder.
2565,2565,2565,2566,5,These are excellent quality flaxseeds! I just toasted them a little on a pan and even that made a great snack! I also powdered them in a coffee grinder after toasting them a little and the powder is delicious too :) Delicious + Nutritious = Awesome! :))) Planning to have it in my cereal tomorrow and maybe sprinkle some on my veggies. I think I will also try out Bob's Quinoa and Museli.
2566,2566,2566,2567,5,"This is the 2nd order i have placed for Bob's Red Mill Organic Flaxseed. It is a good quality whole flaxseed. We grind it a little at a time and sprinkle it on cereal and in yogurt. It keeps a long time in the freezer. I have been using this flaxseed for about a year now ,eating a tablespoon about every day and have noticed that my skin is softer , plus it keeps me regular, if ya know what i mean !!! Flaxseed is also a good way to get in some of the Omega 3's, that the body needs."
2567,2567,2567,2568,3,It was my mistake - I thought there were 6 bags rather than 4. So the price per bag is much higher than what I pay at the local grocery for the same product.
2568,2568,2568,2569,4,The flax seed is packaged in separate smaller packages so that it can stay fresher longer and it was recommended by the flax cookbook I purchased.  This seed was cheaper than other brands I had checked on.  I am putting it away for any emergency that may arise.
2569,2569,2569,2570,5,"I bought this before I realized how much I was getting and before I knew they had it at the grocery store! That was my own fault. I really should have waited. But the seeds are great, I just have way too many in my freezer!"
2570,2570,2570,2571,4,"I hope that this is really as nutritious as the claims.  I chew on this like the Romans and Greeks and it gets stuck on my molars.<br /><br />These seeds were easier going down when sprinkled on top of crab and egg fried rice.  Go figure.<br /><br />I incorporated a 1.5 cup into the regular white loaf recipe from The Breadbaker's Apprentice and found that the addition meant more warm water was needed to hydrate the dough and I did not get much of a rise, so I baked the loaf with tin foil over the loaf pan and the bread rose to its usual height.  Since white bread is not that healthy, I will include flax seed ground in my food processor to ameliorate the ill effects."
2571,2571,2571,2572,2,Given the recent issues with products made in China I have decided to not buy any food products from there so I won't be buying anymore of this snack.  If they ever switch to made in the U.S. I'll buy it again as I did like it.
2572,2572,2572,2573,1,"This product is made in China.  I would not believe any claims they make regarding allergy safety and vegan/kosher.  Considering Mrs. May's markets itself as a healthy product, I was shocked when I glanced at the back and noticed this product was made in China. China has proven that we can not trust their manufacturing practices. Unsafe toys, dog food, and now we're supposed to trust them making our health food?<br /><br />Not to mention the carbon footprint created by shipping something halfway around the world. I will not buy this product anymore."
2573,2573,2573,2574,5,"These are wonderfully crunchy and delicious. The calorie count is misleading, however! One piece is more than the 25 calories they claim it is. But it's worth it!."
2574,2574,2574,2575,5,"If you like nuts and you're looking for a healthy, great tasting snack, you can't go wrong with Almond Crunch!  My husband and I recently eliminated high fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated soybean oil from our diet and we feel so much better.  Trying to find tasty snacks that don't contain these products is not easy so we were thrilled to find Mrs. Mays Naturals.  We love the Cashew Crunch as well!"
2575,2575,2575,2576,1,I'm a little shocked that this so-called health food product is made from Chinese grown ingredients.  I'd be curious to see what the carbon footprint of each bite is.  Also keep in mind that Chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of contaminants such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other exported food products. All the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the United States.  Why not support products and companies who source locally and consider our own economy before we sell out for a slightly cheaper price?  Your purchasing choice does make a difference.  Let's stop expecting corporations and governments to take care of our safety and economy.  They never will.  We can change the way these companies do business for the benefit of our long term health and economical well-being. Make purchase decisions wisely.
2576,2576,2576,2577,5,The nuts used tasted very fresh. The bite sized chunks were just right. It is lightly sweetened but not too sweet. Very satisfying = )
2577,2577,2577,2578,5,"Ok, I can't speak for when the last review was written, which looks like 2009, but I'm looking at the back of a bag of Almond Crunch and it clearly says that the product is made in California, not China. So if that was the main deterent back then, it's no longer an issue. I just discovered this snack and as a person who can't eat either gluten, soy, or dairy, I am thrilled to find a snack I can eat first of all, and a snack I can eat that is actually tasty, even better! I've been eating these for a few days now and no adverse reactions (and I have an extremely sensitive stomach). I plan on trying out all the flavors to figure out which ones I like the best but yeah, I'd highly recommend this product to those on restricted diets and even to those who aren't."
2578,2578,2578,2579,5,"I'm known to be nuts for nuts, and I've tried nuts from around the world, as friends bring them back for me as gifts. Very near the top of the list of the best nut snacks is Mrs. May's Almond Crunch. From the first time I tasted it, to every time I eat it now, I am amazed at the crunchiness, quality of the almonds, lightly-sweetened glaze which is very unbrittle-like, attention to healthiness in the ingredients, etc. As a side note, because of how much I was impressed by this product, I went on a tasting spree by buying about 12 different kinds of Mrs. May's products, from the peanut and cashew crunches to the various sesame crunches, etc. Perhaps I'm biased to the original, but none of the others have that same magic. I would rate the rest as 4 stars. But the almond crunch should get 6 stars."
2579,2579,2579,2580,5,"These are fresh, crunchy, natural, and healthy snacks you can reseal and keep in the car, crumble into non-fat yogurt or over salads, or pack some in the kids lunch. Convenient and delicious."
2580,2580,2580,2581,4,"Based on other Amazon reviews, I tried this product.  The first shipment was great; delicious.  Thought I'd found my new healthful snack. 2nd shipment was a concern and disappointment.  Even thought of calling the company; but i didn't.  Several different packages had incredibly hard pieces of ??  wasn't sure they were almonds.  Became concerned I'd chip a tooth, so I haven't ordered any more."
2581,2581,2581,2582,5,"Delicious, healthy, plus Amazon is cheaper than if you buy them from Mrs. Mays actual website."
2582,2582,2582,2583,4,"Love these snacks! They're a little bit sweet, loads of crunchy almonds. Am looking forward to trying the other varieties, too."
2583,2583,2583,2584,4,"After reading some of the frothing reviews criticizing Mrs. Mays for manufacturing their product in China -- which doesn't in any way address the quality of the product itself -- I tried to confirm this for myself. The website and packaging say nothing about this, so I wrote them an email asking where their product is manufactured. Here is the response in full:<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Thank you for your purchase and inquiry.

We hope we have assisted you correctly.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Julie<br />Mrs Mays<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I've read other reviews criticizing over sweatshops, Communism, and carbon footprint. To briefly address these: There has been no evidence that Mrs. Mays keeps its workers in sweatshops; despite the Communism, I'm sure the individual citizens find these jobs valuable; and ships produce 1/10th the carbon per pound-mile of trucks, meaning a 5000 miles by ship is as bad as 500 miles by truck.<br /><br />I really like the snack and I'd give it five stars, but I'm subtracting one star: I think it is deceptive that it was so hard to find out the snack was made in China. I don't have a problem with the snack's origin, but Mrs. Mays should be more forthright with their customers and let them make the decision themselves. Granted, most of us Americans are primed to flip out at the latest Scare of the Week, but that should be our choice to make.<br /><br />Oh, and the snack itself? It is quite tasty, filling, and healthy. I will continue to purchase it."
2584,2584,2584,2585,1,Mrs. May's should inform their customers where exactly their products are made and take a stand. I won't be buying any more of her products until further notice no matter how yummy they are. Do-no-harm and quality-control is a concept not understood in China. Totally frightening what they're getting away with.
2585,2585,2585,2586,5,"My husband has diabetes and has to watch what he eats....this is a great and healthy treat for him!  I couldn't find it at local stores, and was happy to see it available on Amazon!"
2586,2586,2586,2587,5,"There ought to be a recovery program. But the good side is that a Mrs. Mays addiction is healthy. I already have a stack of boxes in the garage so I won't run out. And here I am stockpiling more (in case of nuclear holocaust).<br /><br />Almonds have always been my staff of life -- raw, roasted, dry roasted, blanched, flavored, and of course Mrs Mays. I rarely have a day without them. I even feed them to the parrot. A bird guy told me they were the healthiest. And the bird goes nuts for Mrs. Mays.<br /><br />These are, dare I say, miracle nuts. One taste and I was hooked. How she can pack all that goodness into such a tasty snack with such healthy ingredients is a miracle. If you're tired of tastless, bland, gotta-eat-it-because-its-healthy snacks from the nutrition store, try these for a pleasant awakening.<br /><br />Mike"
2587,2587,2587,2588,5,"We are typical Americans who know we should eat better, but often don't because ""health"" food is usually expensive and frankly doesn't taste that good.  That is why we are so thankful to have found Mrs. May's products!!  They are all very healthy and quite tasty, and ordering them from Amazon keeps the cost down.  My son's a golfer, and I am always looking for portable, healthy snacks for him to tuck in his golf bag.  Mrs. May's products fit the bill nicely."
2588,2588,2588,2589,5,"My family and I love Almond Crunch, they're just sweet enough, very crunchy, and a perfect snack."
2589,2589,2589,2590,5,I have tryed the Almond Crunch and is delicious and healthy snack better than chips Try it you'll agree
2590,2590,2590,2591,5,"This product is excellent. It's also a nut snack that my wife, who has celiac disease, and is allergic to wheat and glueton can enjoy. I however can eat anything and this is the tastiest and most unique nut snack I've ever tried.  Al & Virginia Weatherly  53996 Luzerne Dr. Macomb, Mi 48042"
2591,2591,2591,2592,1,"I used to like this product until I learned that it is made in China!<br /><br />How many more horror stories do we need to hear about such atrocities as lead in baby toys made in China, contaminated baby formula made in China, contaminated tooth paste made in China, and poisoned pet food before we learn that -- if it comes from China-- it should not go in your mouth, your baby's mouth, or your pet's mouth??!!!"
2592,2592,2592,2593,5,This is by far the most delicious snack you could ever have!!  The almonds are super fresh and crunchy and the light coating of syrup is not too sweet.  My whole family loves it!!
2593,2593,2593,2594,5,My husband and both love almonds. I've even shared this snack with co-workers and everyone is raving about the good taste of this snack.  I'm taking a few bags on our next backpacking trip.
2594,2594,2594,2595,1,I used to buy these as healthy snacks at my office cafeteria and consider it better than a bag of potato chips.  These taste very crunchy and tasty.<br /><br />Given the kind of unethical food stories we read about China - we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these.  You just cannot import food stuff and sell in the US as gourmet snack food - there needs to be data backing this.<br /><br />Few example of Chinese food (yuk ...):<br /><br />(1) Melamine(kind of platic) in baby food and milk (so wide spread that 80% of milk in China contained this plastic in 2008)<br /><br />(2) Honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin (antibiotic) - because of which it was banned in the US<br /><br />(3) Soy Sauce made from Human hair (not joking google it if you want)<br /><br />(4) Spurious drugs exported to African countries.<br /><br />Need some good facts and quality controls from the Manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls.
2595,2595,2595,2596,5,"The negative reviews of Mrs Mays products just because it is made in China are not really valid, cannot base on other companies' poor quality control and apply to every company in the country!  There are many bad quality foods that are made in the USA that's bad for your health, so just because it's labeled made in USA doesn't mean it is good quality.  As long as a company takes pride in their quality control and not greed for profit only deserves good ratings and fair sales."
2596,2596,2596,2597,5,This is a great product.  We tried it at the beach the first time and loved it.  The cashew crunch was not as good.<br />We bought a case of the almond this week.  Just great!
2597,2597,2597,2598,3,not real crazy but this product. They did not taste good but looked real cute in the little booties I made for the baby shower tables.
2598,2598,2598,2599,5,"I am in love with this tea. Every other apple cinnamon tea I've tried has been too cinnamon-y. This is the perfect blend. It tastes like apple cider without all the sugar, which I love. I recommend this tea to anyone who wants a low-cal version of apple cider."
2599,2599,2599,2600,5,"This is the perfect gift with a southwestern flair.  The jelly's were of decent size, the spreader is a nice quality piece with a small glass chili pepper attached.<br /><br />Cute little bag - great gift for the price!"
2600,2600,2600,2601,3,I thought it was okay but not Harbanero BBQ sauce from Hell.I would probally not get it again.Also it was not worth the money I thought it was kind of a ripoff it was 10$ for barbque sauce you could have made at home.
2601,2601,2601,2602,5,"Montebello pasta has been made at the Monastero di Montebello in Isolo del Piana, Italy since 1388. I love Italian food but have severe digestive and allergic problems, and their pasta is friendly to me, and it tastes better than any other pasta I have eaten, and that's a lot, it is one of my favorite foods."
2602,2602,2602,2603,5,"So... I usually consider pasta to be pasta to be pasta.  It's usually all the same to me.  HOWEVER... when I tried this brand of pasta, I noticed that it does taste better.  I can't describe how exactly, but it does.  I thought maybe it was my imagination (maybe knowing it's organic was influencing my judgment) but my sister commented on it when I served it for her one day.  She wanted to know where I got it - it tasted so good.  Hmmm.  So while usually there isn't much of a taste difference when it comes to noodles and pasta, for this brand there is.  It's subtle, but it's there.  When we moved from California I discovered they didn't sell it in the stores here in NY.  So I was elated when I found Amazon carries it.  Elated over a simple pasta?  Yes, that's how good it is in comparison!  Mmmmmm Mmmmm!"
2603,2603,2603,2604,5,"Best taste pasta. Cooks very well, slightly less time than typical mass produced pasta. Nice color and mouthfeel. Just excellent."
2604,2604,2604,2605,5,I have long searched for a great linguine and spagetti and this is it! Just made linguine with clam sauce and each time my husband remarks how terrific it is.  I buy in packages of 5 for both spagetti and linguine and will reorder when close to being out.
2605,2605,2605,2606,4,Good product just a little mellow on the pumpkin pie flavor to me. A little sugar on top before you brew picks it a enough though. Overall good coffee
2606,2606,2606,2607,5,These are hard to find these days.  Product arrived perfect and the gum was fresh and tasty.  We kept the box for about 1 year and the last pack tasted as good as the first.
2607,2607,2607,2608,5,"Gum made without sugar substitutes isn't easily obtained these days, so I was happy to find Chiclets through Amazon Prime.  Sugar substitutes present problems for persons sensitive to them, so it's good to have the option of gum made the old-fashioned way. Another source for this and other gum from yesteryear is Vermont Country Store online; however VCS sells the same box of Chiclets for $14.95, so clearly Amazon is a better deal.  Amazon Prime (free shipping) makes it a much better deal.<br /><br />My Great-Grandpa used to come home with Chiclets from time to time, so this gum isn't just loaded with long-lasting peppermint flavor, but long-lasting, happy memories, as well.  I guess you can say there's a lot packed into such a little piece of gum.  Hope you enjoy as much as I do."
2608,2608,2608,2609,5,"I love drinking green tea.  It is delicious hot or cold, but being able to take it with me anywhere was key.  So I searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome, expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the US.  In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews.  Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The product works as advertised.  It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too.  The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter.<br /><br />It not only saves money, but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that I need to recycle monthly."
2609,2609,2609,2610,5,"The first part of this review is a history of my health problems and what green tea bottles and sugar had to do with me finding the stash teas products. If you do not want to read that part, skip down to the bottom, and there is the review of the stash teas, only.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A couple of years ago I had a physical and my doctor told me that my Triglycerides were high. I was a serious soda drinker (sometimes as many as 5 cans per day, not diet), so I decided I needed to start drinking something ""healthlier."" I gravitated toward Green Tea because I like it. I averaged 2-3 1/2 liter bottles per day for 2 years (I also averaged about 1-2 cans of soda per day).<br /><br />I recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down THEY DOUBLED. They were over 300 (over 150 is considered high). I about had a heart attack right there. Now, I am not an overweight person, and have had a fairly high motabolism, but I have started to create a belly (I call it a Dr. Pepper belly because that is my favorite soda. I do not drink alcohol of any kind). I am telling all of this to you because ALL of my other tests came in within normal levels, including all other aspects to my cholesterol.<br /><br />I did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area, it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products. The excess sugar consumed, in this case, can be turned into trigylcerides. I looked at what I was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me. What I found shocked me. The 1/2 liter bottles of green tea has MORE sugar in it than a can of soda. I checked several different manufacturers of green tea and I found them all to have about the same amount of sugar.<br /><br />I concluded that between my morning coffee, green tea bottles and soda, I was consuming over 1,100 grams of sugar a week ( or about 4,000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks)!!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products. I personally, do not have the time or patience to use tea bags, so I was interested in the tea powders. I ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it. And I loved it. I then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also.<br /><br />There are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added, so I use a few drops of Stevia Glycerite to sweeten the drink. It does not take a lot.<br /><br />The best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1/2 or less than the bottled green teas I use to drink.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />To end on a personal note, I have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1+ liter of water per day. I still drink 1 can of Dr. Pepper on the weekend, but that is it. I have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills, I have lost about 5 lbs. and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is."
2610,2610,2610,2611,4,"I like the taste of this product, but I have some suggestions:<br /><br />1) for strongest blueberry taste, use less than the 16 ounces of water that the instructions indicate (my first try came out like water with the merest hint of blueberry);<br /><br />2) stir REALLY well and be prepared for a bit of sediment anyway, as well as for an oddly green (I know it's green tea, but I rarely drink green things, so it seemed a bit weird to me at first); and<br /><br />3) if you're going to use a sweetener, why cancel out the health bennies by adding something like aspartame or Splenda or etc? I added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect, but then I also like it without any sweetener at all (as long as I use less water).<br /><br />By the way, this makes hot tea as well, although it's marketed as iced tea powder.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
2611,2611,2611,2612,5,I ordered this item because it was on sale and because of the health benefits of green tea.  I wasn't certain how good it was going to be but I was pleasantly surprised.  It tastes refreshing and fruity.  The flavor isn't overpowering or fake.  I mix the powder in a sports bottle along with cold water and splenda.  The powder dissolves easily and the drink has a nice green tea and blueberry taste.  I was so impressed that I have signed up for automatic delivery.  It's a great product.
2612,2612,2612,2613,5,"If you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder. The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for ""White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream,"" ""Green Tea Papaya Nectar"" and ""Green Tea Sugar Cookies."" You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required. This tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water. I can highly recommend it to you.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
2613,2613,2613,2614,4,"lots of uses for this green tea...<br /><br />I generally like most tea (though not the over-ally flowery blends)...<br /><br />Being on more of a health kick in recent years, I have added a lot more GREEN tea to my diet in one form or another...<br />from straight brewed tea &lt;> hot or iced...<br /><br />To adding the powder to things like salad dressings, smoothies, baked goods, etc.<br /><br />I am not new to green tea....as I first started drinking it when living in Japan some 30+ years ago....<br />in the ground form known as matcha.<br />A quality product. Dissolves well.<br /><br />I like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened."
2614,2614,2614,2615,2,"I expected the flavor to be more like that of ""brewed"" green tea. It really does taste like dried green tea leaves simply dissolved in water. Although I'm sure this is probably a good way to get a concentrated amount of antioxidants, I wouldn't order this again."
2615,2615,2615,2616,5,"Ingredients listed: Pure cane sugar, and 100% pure powdered Japanese green tea.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts: all 0%, except Sodium (15mg) and Sugar (12g)<br /><br />Basic Instructions: add one packet to 8oz of cold water and stir or shake well to dissolve...<br /><br />My Opinion: It is too sweet for my taste, even diluted in a 16.9oz water bottle. It almost tastes like sugar water. I think the unsweetened version would be better. 5 star because it delivers what it promises.<br /><br />This is Japanese green tea. NOT Chinese green tea. There is a difference."
2616,2616,2616,2617,5,I KEEP THIS AT WORK AND I MIX IN MY SMOOTHIES AT HOME- LOVE IT!
2617,2617,2617,2618,3,This tea is not so tasty in my opinion. But one thing about opinions is that every one has one and we do not always agree.
2618,2618,2618,2619,4,"I make a ""jug"" of this tea every morning and keep a glass throughout the day.  I'm delighted to find a source in the US as it was introduced to me in B.C.  It does not have the jasmine flavor which upsets my otherwise very strong tummy."
2619,2619,2619,2620,2,"As others have said, this is REALLY MILD in flavor!  The instructions call for 1 packet per 16 oz. of water.  There are 6 packets per box.<br /><br />I decided to give it a try as I am basically lazy and wanted some (unsweetened; unlemoned) iced tea that I could make on a moment's whim.<br /><br />I started with 1 packet per 16 oz of water; then 2 packets per 16 oz of water and got SOME flavor.  Now I'm using 3 packets per 16 oz. of water.  (I placed a fairly large order so I could experiment with it AND have it throughout the fall and winter.)<br /><br />Since I'm using triple the amount of product in order to get some flavor, I will probably not order this item again."
2620,2620,2620,2621,1,"I have been drinking green tea powder for a few years and have come to love the slightly bitter and tannic flavor of it. I decided to try the Stash brand instead of my normal Japanese brand, and it's not even in the same universe. The Stash product is just green colored powder with no flavor at all. Seriously, the Stash brand uses a maltodextrin base and it has dehydrated tea added to it. Real, authentic green tea powder is supposed to be 100% tea, with no additives!<br /><br />If you drink a lot of green tea, you will be very disappointed with the Stash product. I strongly recommend you go with a Japanese brand that contains 100% tea ONLY.<br /><br />I tried to return it to Amazon, but they don't allow grocery items to be returned!"
2621,2621,2621,2622,5,This is good iced tea. It is hard to find locally in the Fall and Winter.
2622,2622,2622,2623,5,This is a quick and convenient way to drink green tea! I add lemon juice and stevia.
2623,2623,2623,2624,5,"To get a more intense taste, I mix two packets in a 16-oz BPA-free Camelbak bottle, adding 8 oz of water and the rest ice, plus a packet of Stevia, shake well, sip, and oh so good! No-calorie sweet tea, green tea antioxidants, and I'm drinking a lot more water. I also carry packets in my purse and add to water in restaurants, saving tons of money from ordering drinks and not to mention calories. Although the Stash rep tells me there is a ""negligible"" amount of caffeine, the placebo effect gives me a great boost in the morning before my workout. Since I love mint, I think I've found the perfect product."
2624,2624,2624,2625,4,"This tea is more ginger than lemon, so if you like the taste of soothing ginger, you'd like this product. I mix two packages per 16 oz BPA-free Camelbak bottle, filled with 8 oz of water and the rest ice, and a packet of stevia. Shake well, take sip, ahhh - no-calorie sweet tea, green tea antioxidant, and great for summer. I called the Stash company to find out how much caffeine was in a packet, and the rep said ""negligible.""<br /><br />I also buy the Stash powdered mint green tea, and I prefer the hint of mint better. Again, if you are a ginger fan, you'd really enjoy this product."
2625,2625,2625,2626,5,"I think this is a great green tea powder.  I add this powder to a 24oz water bottle and it has a nice light taste, I prefer it unsweeted so that I may add a sweetner if needed.  Great price for the quantity and the quality of the product."
2626,2626,2626,2627,5,I use the powdered tea powder in my fruit smoothies.  Provides you all the health benefits of green tea.  Love the product and use both the plain and lemon ginger.
2627,2627,2627,2628,5,I like the mild sweet flavor of this instant tea.  I've added it to lots of different drinks like juices and energy drinks.  I have fun mixing it with things.  It blends well for me.
2628,2628,2628,2629,4,"This is a quick & easy way to make green tea. It isn't sweet & only has the barest hint of blueberry, but it makes it easy when pressed for time in the morning. It does have more green tint to it than most teas- here's why: ""Sencha green tea comes from the Kyoto region of Japan. It is made from small leaves and has a more refined taste than others forms of green tea. Additionally, the color of the tea is actually green, not yellow, like many Chinese varieties."" Powdered tea is also good for cooking as well."
2629,2629,2629,2630,5,I went on a diet last year and was looking for something goos to drink and came across this tes!  now I can't find it anywhere... Hope Amazon keeps this product forever!
2630,2630,2630,2631,2,"What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable.<br />unfortunately by doing that to this flavor, the ginger was out of control, and not in a good ginger tea sort of way.<br />Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market."
2631,2631,2631,2632,4,"I held off ordering these for a while because I was concerned I might not like the taste. I've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!<br /><br />Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.  I am very happy with the product.  I will order again."
2632,2632,2632,2633,3,"I was looking for an alternative green or white iced tea powder after I realized that the Lipton brands all contained sucralose, and did not come in an unsweetened version.  I found Stash tea online and decided to try it, using stevia as the sweetener.  I bought the lemon ginger flavor.<br /><br />By comparison, I think the Lipton powdered iced tea I had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity ""kool-aid"" for adults.  This is different.  I am having to get used to the green tea taste, and it upset my stomach a little (when I drink hot tea, I usually drink white tea, because I like the mild taste).<br /><br />I tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better.  I would probably like white tea better, but Stash doesn't make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix.  Anyway I hope to get used to the taste.  Since right now I like it watered-down, it's really a good deal as far as price."
2633,2633,2633,2634,5,"I wanted something easy, tasty , and healthy to sub for my diet soda addiction. This did the trick. I drank it for 10 days without adding any sweetener. Once you get past the color, which is a nasty green, the tea is tasty. About a half tsp of sugar really adds to the taste. I will buy this again!"
2634,2634,2634,2635,5,If you like the flavor of green tea and like your beverage iced you will enjoy this beverage.<br /><br />I like the taste of green tea and I also like the health benefits of green tea.  I mix this with ice water and splenda.  It is a refreshing summer beverage.  I like that it dissolves easily and is packaged in small packages.  It is convenient and easy to use.
2635,2635,2635,2636,5,"This is just the quick iced tea fix I have been searching for.....it is perfectly balanced between the green tea and the natural, refreshing blueberry flavor. Keep in mind this is NOT sweet and sassy, like most instant tea ""add to bottled water"" packets. This is the real deal. If you want sweet, then order the sweet variety or add your favorite sweetener. When you add the powder, it is green....looks alittle weird, but once you can get past the looks, it's true love. I think it's delightful that I am actually consuming the entire leaf--finely ground to which it dissloves....thus making my water become murky, swamp water before my eyes!  That has to certainly be more bang for your buck for the level of antioxidants, opposed to the old brewing way.<br />  I have had a very difficult journey (until now) finding yummy, healthy (& QUICK) unsweetened flavored teas......my second favorite is the Celestial Seasonings COOL BREW bags....the blueberry green tea is also delicious, but not nearly as refined as this ""top shelf"" Stash.<br />I am pondering more flavors for my next order!"
2636,2636,2636,2637,2,"What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable.<br />Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market."
2637,2637,2637,2638,4,"Good flavor, but not real sweet.  I add a little stevia for my sweet tooth."
2638,2638,2638,2639,5,"Drank an instant green tea from a major producer for several years. Then they changed production and began using sucralose which I don't tolerate well.<br />Tried several different teas before I found Stash's instant green tea. I like it best with a little fresh lemon lime juice. I can drink all I want--don't even need sweetener. Plus as I understand it, it's just made from dried, pulverized green tea leaves--no chemical process. Also it's very coolby I get a discount forn having it delivered by monthly subscription. Phil K."
2639,2639,2639,2640,2,"I wanted desperately to love, or even like this drink mix, but am not having success doing so. I love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me. It's too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it. Every once in a while I'll try to tolerate a bottle again hoping I change my taste. It's not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people."
2640,2640,2640,2641,5,"THis ice tea, is like heaven on ice.  must try if you love lemon and giger.  Great price for the content.  You can make a pitcher with 4 bags and add some lemon and whatever your sweetner you prefer.  Great for barbeque parties or a tea with the ladies"
2641,2641,2641,2642,5,This tea is awesome.  You have to keep stirring it if it sits too long but the taste is great.  Little prep time- keeps me going all day.
2642,2642,2642,2643,5,"This product is great. I have been searching for an easy to use and non sweetened green tea. So many of the teas are sweetened with Splenda type sweeteners and I prefer to use Stevia. The Jackie Chan green tea appears to have been discontinued.<br /><br />I mix this product and love the taste. A little lemon and Stevia and I have the perfect evening iced tea. It provides all the benefits of green tea, and the instant convenience.<br /><br />I give it five stars"
2643,2643,2643,2644,5,"this is the best iced green tea I've ever had; the hint of blueberry is just perfect.  I add a bit of Stevia for a little more sweetness.  It would be an insult to call this ""instant tea,"" but I carry a packet in my purse because it's better than any prepared tea I could buy when eating out.  Stash tea is always good, but this is extraordinary."
2644,2644,2644,2645,3,"When I received the package just earlier today I was excited to try it out immediately. I'm already a loyal drinker of the Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea Powder and wanted to give Stash a try, particularly the mint flavor (Yamamotoyama only has three flavors: original unsweetened, sweetened and raspberry). When I checked the ingredients of this product (ground Sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor) I already expected that this would be unsweetened (after all, mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said ""natural"", I expected it unsweetened).<br /><br />I do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle, however I could sense a bit of the mint. Maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content, you'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong ""mint"" flavor.<br /><br />But the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it (well in this case it has natural peppermint in it) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats, such as smoothies and even desserts. Just the other day I even added the Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my Muesli hot cereal and it was delicious. I plan to do the same with this Stash mint green tea powder (I'm an experimenting foodie so doesn't hurt to try LOL) with my hot cereal and milk.<br /><br />You can even substitute milk instead of water. Ever tasted maccha green tea latte that you get from Starbucks and Jamba Juice before? Try it with this one. :)"
2645,2645,2645,2646,1,"I wasted a little over $15.00 because the reviews were so good.<br />This has no taste cold or hot. It states to use 16oz of cold water.<br />Well, I used just a cup and it didn't work out for me.<br />I tried adding more packets and it helped but very little.<br />I am an avid tea and coffee drinker and can only resolve<br />that the other reviewers have never had a good strong cup<br />of green tea--, or I am missing something here.<br />I do not recommend this tea."

2648,2648,2648,2649,1,This tea is the most awful stuff I've ever put in my mouth.  It has a chemical taste.  I tried adding sugar and it didn't help. I enjoy the Arizona Pomegranate Gree Tea and would highly recomment it.
2649,2649,2649,2650,3,"This tea has an awfully light flavor. I use this powder to make green tea lattes and green tea frappes. Very tasty. I generally shake 12 ounces cold milk, 2-3 packets of this tea powder, and 1 ounce simple syrup, then pour it over ice. Tho make the frappe, I blend the same ingredients with ice, instead of pouring it over ice. It is annoying that to make a small drink I need to use 2-3 times more than expected."
2650,2650,2650,2651,3,"I've had quite a few sencha powders in my time.  The Stash product is one of the best-priced products out there.<br /><br />That said, what you get per packet is a bit on the light side for mixing with 16 oz of water.  I can barely taste the tea, and I'm pretty sensitive to tea flavors.  If you get this product, keep your mixes at 8 oz of water - otherwise, it's like you're drinking a flavorless algae.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a good product at a good price.  At proper concentrations, the flavor is good, and you can't beat the health benefits of a good sencha/green tea."
2651,2651,2651,2652,5,"I first tried these powdered green teas from Stash last summer. This spring I wanted more, but the store I got them from didn't think the vendor would be carrying any.  I was delighted to find that I could get them from Amazon. I ordered a whole bunch and look forward to having refreshing REAL FOOD drinks all summer in an easy to make form."
2652,2652,2652,2653,5,"I finally finished my box of the Blueberry Green Tea Powder and wanted to try something new!  So glad I tried this flavor as it is now my favorite!  Just add it to a cold bottle of water, drink it as is, or add a few drops of Stevia or Agave and you are good to go.  Very refreshing!!  Will be packing this on my trip to Mexico!"
2653,2653,2653,2654,4,"lots of uses for this green tea...<br /><br />I generally like most tea (though not the over-ally flowery blends)...<br /><br />Being on more of a health kick in recent years, I have added a lot more GREEN tea to my diet in one form or another...<br />from straight brewed tea &lt;> hot or iced...<br /><br />To adding the powder to things like salad dressings, smoothies, baked goods, etc.<br /><br />I am not new to green tea....as I first started drinking it when living in Japan some 30+ years ago....<br />in the ground form known as matcha.<br />A quality product. Dissolves well.<br /><br />I like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened."
2654,2654,2654,2655,5,"As a long time tea drinker, was happy to come across this iced tea mix.  It serves as my sports drink while exercising or golfing.  I find this iced tea very refreshing.  I really like the flavor and especially the low sugar content.  The plain green is my favorite followed by the raspberry.  The blueberry is good too; it's unsweetened, so I add half a packet of Truvia."
2655,2655,2655,2656,4,"I really enjoy this tea because it's not to sweet and it's easy to use.  I carry it and my mug with me and just add hot or cold water, depending upon my mood.  I find that it gives me just the right kind of energy and it can even hold my hunger between meals. A real great thing because I watch my calories.  And of course, green tea is full of antioxidants."
2656,2656,2656,2657,5,This is good iced tea.  It is hard to find locally in the Fall and Winter.
2657,2657,2657,2658,5,I am hooked.  This is a great way to get more fluids into my day without making it seem like a chore.  This powder tastes great without any additional sweeteners.  It is just what I have been looking for.  Also try the Blueberry version.  Delicious!
2658,2658,2658,2659,5,"Green tea is good for you, loaded with antioxidants, boosts your metabolism, yadda, yadda, yadda, but I never quite warmed up to the taste.  Until now.  The lemon and the ginger give this a very nice flavor.  And it is SO great that I can just add a packet to my water bottle and go, without the bother of brewing it."
2659,2659,2659,2660,5,"Just the right amount of blueberry flavor, and the tea itself is not overwhelming. I love that it has no added sweeteners, and really does not need them.<br />This is a perfect way to get more water and benefit from the antioxidants in the tea as well!"
2660,2660,2660,2661,5,I drink this delicious tea almost every day.  I have yet to find anything like it on the market.
2661,2661,2661,2662,5,Love this product!  It adds flavor to your water without all the nasty artificial sweetners.  Hope this product is here to stay!
2662,2662,2662,2663,4,"Powdered green tea with lemon & ginger provides quick daily source of antioxidant ingredients desired but in higher concentration and without the bother of brewing tea bags. Simply pour in water bottle, shake and be on your way.<br /><br />Product used to be available in local health food stores but is no longer carried. Much easier and more cost effective when bought in quantity on Amazon."

2664,2664,2664,2665,5,"I was looking for mint green tea I could carry with me to mix up while out and about. If that's what you want, then this product is perfect. I add a little extra water, but that's just my taste. So, if you're looking for mint green tea powder . . . look no further!"
2665,2665,2665,2666,5,"This has a great rich taste. Remember this is ground whole leaf, so the tea is stronger than you may expect.  Not overly sweet and dissolves readily.  I use it during workouts mixed with ice water in a Polar bottle."
2666,2666,2666,2667,5,"I liked the flavor and the ease to mix this tea.  I use a few packets and make a pitcher to keep in the fridge.  Very good COLD and needs NO sweetening as is lightly sweet already.  Doesn't look pretty, but DOES look like a healthy drink!  I liked it!"
2667,2667,2667,2668,4,"I purchased this item when it was on sale.  I wasn't certain if I'd like it but I've read so much about the health benefits of green tea I wanted to try it.  This is a nice, pleasant beverage. The flavor isn't too strong.  I add a packet of Splenda to make it a bit sweeter.  The powder dissolves easily in cold water.  The flavor is natural not fake.  I was impressed enough with it that I have signed up for auto-delivery."
2668,2668,2668,2669,1,The tea was very weak and not that good. Now I have six boxes of tea I that no one in my family likes.
2669,2669,2669,2670,5,"LOVE this!  I dislike drinking plain water and have been looking for something easy that I could add to my s/s water bottle (gotta be good to the environment, right?)  The flavor is great, ease of convenience is wonderful and the hint of sweet is not overpowering at all.  I can drink my green tea with or without sweetener.  The only thing is if you want to drink green tea all day long, the calories WILL add up - I think each packet is 60 calories.  I drink 2 (32 oz) bottles of water a day so that would be 120 calories of sweetened drink a day.  But I will still give the product 5 stars because the product is fab.  I'd just pick something else if I'm going to pound water all day long (perhaps the blueberry green tea one which is NOT sweetened - it's excellent as well)  I'll use this for one bottle and a non-sweetened one for the other.  Best of both worlds.  Enjoy!"
2670,2670,2670,2671,5,I used to always go to Jamba Juice for the Match green tea shots...after trying this iced green tea powder I was hooked.  This flavor is lightly sweetend and the raspberry and pomegranate flavors are just subtle enough to not mask the true flavor of the green tea.  I don't mind the funny green color...after all it's green tea.
2671,2671,2671,2672,1,This iced tea is terrible. This is the first Stash product that I do not enjoy. It is not iced tea. It tastes more like powdered peppermint leaves.
2672,2672,2672,2673,1,"The first ingredient in this mix, before the tea is even listed is maltodextrin.  If you suffer from a corn allergy, please do not forget to read the label & unwittingly drink this.  I have no idea why there is more maltodextrin in this product than the main product, the tea itself.  I realize this is not a review, let alone a ""helpful review"", as I did not describe the taste of the product or even review the product. I couldn't review this product, if I wanted too.  I want people with a corn allergy to be advised of the ingredients in the tea.  I didn't know how else to inform folks about the ingredients except for on the page with reviews.  I could not give the product more stars, as it contains more maltodextrin, than tea itself."
2673,2673,2673,2674,5,"i have never liked green tea but i knew it was good for me so i have been drinking it for a lot of yrs. i grew up living in the western usa and our neighbors were japanese. they were sweet and gave us tea from japan. my father enjoyed it every morning and added a tablespoon of honey and a little cream to it. he smoked all his life and died at 92. anyway, i found when at times i would quit drinking it i wouldn't feel as good as i did when drinking it. i got tired of boiling the water with the teabags and then getting everything in a container to put into the frig. i really drank a lot of it.  well, i stumbled onto a warehouse to pick up some things i had ordered and noticed this tea. i was immediately interested as you get to drink the whole tea leaf which gives you 10 times more antioxidants. wow, that was good for me so i got a couple cases and when i ran out searched the internet for stash brand. i really love it. i love that it is LIGHTLY SWEETENED, i love that i can just open a packet and throw it into my tumbler, add ice and water and be on my way. it's just right. but more then anything else i love the way it makes me feel. so much more energy and i truly believe it is helping my well being. no getting around about it i don't get sick often for sure. now i haven't tried the other brands and i feel i don't have to because i am so satisfied with this one. the price is also cheaper. i don't think you can go wrong with this choice.  perky"
2674,2674,2674,2675,5,love the ease of having green natural tea anywhear any time . tastes great i love this stash green tea
2675,2675,2675,2676,1,"I bought this tea as I like blueberries, and Stash is known as making good teas.  However, when I first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green (not very appetizing).  Once I mixed the powder with water, the resulting tea had no real flavor.  I feel like I wasted my money and can't get a refund."
2676,2676,2676,2677,4,"This is one of my favorite water add-ins. I think it has a really crisp, clean taste...with a hint of grassy-ness. The tea particles tend to settle at the bottom of the bottle, if left standing for more than a few minutes, so I have to shake it up periodically. There are times when I feel like I'm drinking something that was squeezed off the blades of a lawnmower, but this seems to be based on my choice of sweetener. It tastes great when I use stevia, but when I use Sweet & Low...I get a bitter-ish grassy taste."
2677,2677,2677,2678,2,"I bought this ""flavor"" and the raspberry pom and while they are consistent, it's useless.<br /><br />If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak in flavor, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so you're much better off brewing your own.<br /><br />However, if you're idea is to ""stash"" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men, which would be weird) it's still misses the mark. One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 to 12 packets in a box (depends on flavor, who knows why?), that gives you 4 to 6, 16 oz drinks for $3.

2681,2681,2681,2682,2,This was a big disappointment. There was no raspberry or pomegranate flavor to this. The color is green and not very appealing to look at. However it does work as a great antioxidant.
2682,2682,2682,2683,1,I wish I had read the product description better....I didn;t realize this was sweetened...I do not like the sweetened teas...now I am stuck with 2 orders of them....but the other green tea powder is great.
2683,2683,2683,2684,1,"When I saw the mint iced tea powder on the website, I thought I would like it. But when  I received it and tried one, I was very disappointed. It was the green tea and not sweet at all. The flavor was nothing at all like an iced tea like I was expecting. I had to add sugar to it to get a flavor that I like to be similar to regular iced tea. I don't even know if I'll be using the others I had received. Sorry about this, but you did ask for my review on this."
2684,2684,2684,2685,5,"What a lovely tea this is! The rose petals are abundant in the mix, and when you brew a pot of tea and then raise the cup to your lips, the full, sweet scent of roses greets you! This tea is perfectly blended and balanced! Its color is coppery-golden, very warm and luscious. I just want to drink it every day, for relaxation and sheer enjoyment!"
2685,2685,2685,2686,2,"Upon opening the sealed bag, I was struck by an unpleasant scent.  Looking at the ingredients I saw, in addition to the black tea and rosebuds, a ""natural flavor"" additive.  I believe this additive is the culprit to ruining what should have been a delightful bouquet to my nose.  Then I brewed this tea, and could still taste that additive, but overall the tea was tasty.  I hope the Davidson family reads our reviews because I am certain that, if they would just refrain from adding the ""natural flavor,"" I and others would find this tea to be superb, and in keeping with the other teas I have come to enjoy from Davidson's.  For example, upon opening their Darjeeling loose tea, as well as their Assam loose tea, my nose is struck with a lovely bouquet ~ this is what one wants to experience from superb teas.  I will look forward to Davidson's responding to my (and other customer's) suggestion re: this nasty flavor additive.  I've enjoyed tea with rose petals while in India, and they did not put anything other than the tea and the dried rose petals."
2686,2686,2686,2687,1,"This tea was horrible.  It tasted like potpourri.  I have really enjoyed other Davidson's teas,many also containing flowers, and thought to try something new.  I think the last ingredient is where things went bad.  It was ""natural flavor""  which must have been rose oil or something since my tea chemical taste and making a weaker tea did not help at all."
2687,2687,2687,2688,2,"When I ordered this tea, I was so excited because I thought I had finally found the equal to another brand's rose tea (in individual bags). I was excited for the loose quality of the tea, along with the anticipated light delicate taste I'd hoped for.<br />I was sadly mistaken... When I excitedly opened it, I was hit by a very sweet, syrupy, cotton-candy-like smell coming from the bag. Not a good scent. Then, I thought 'the smell doesn't determine the taste' so I steeped the recommended tablespoons for the amount of time indicated and then tried a taste. The overpowering sweet smell gave was to a bitter taste, not at all reminiscent of my previous experience with rose tea. Unfortunately, I had to pour the rest of mine out.<br />I have a bag of Hibiscus tea coming in the mail soon from this company. I'm really hoping it's better!"
2688,2688,2688,2689,5,"This is my first exposure to rose tea. I purchased it because of the previous review. I have to concur. This tea is delightful. The aroma is fantastic and makes you believe you are in the midst of a blooming rose garden. It is a perfect tea to sip in the winter months as it fills your senses with the scents of summer. I bet it would be refreshing as an iced tea with a sprig of fresh mint. Too cold to try that now, but once the snow melts, I will! Great product for the price!"
2689,2689,2689,2690,5,WOW!  I am a PEPSI-holic and was gaining weight as you can imagine. A little 85 year old woman introduced me to your tea HOT.  AND now with just A LITTLE bit of honey and ice I have a nice cool refreshing drink!!
2690,2690,2690,2691,4,"I am pleased the bag is so large; it means I'll be sipping this tea for a while.  This tea is perfect for the start of the work day:  the rose and hibiscus liven my senses; the caffeine pushes me to type a bit faster as I climb over a hillock of e-mails.  The flavors are a bit more pungent than similar blends I've mixed on my own (is the cause the mysterious ""natural flavor"" another reviewer pointed out?), but it is still quite pleasant.  I certainly look forward to many more mornings begun over several cups of rose congou."
2691,2691,2691,2692,5,The fragrance of the tea totally blew me away. Recommend it to anyone who enjoys mild green tea with a pleasant rosey scent.
2692,2692,2692,2693,4,"I am enjoying this tea and the price was reasonable.  I don't think the rose flavor is as pronounced as my favorite rose tea, but since I can not get that one at this time, I ordered this one, and it is very good."
2693,2693,2693,2694,5,"I bought this tea many months ago and waited to review it, to see if I really liked it over time.<br /><br />I do.  This tea is really lovely.  The rose scent and taste are just right -- not too lame, not too overwhelming.  I find it slightly calming, even with the caffeine from the black tea.  Of the 6 or so loose teas in my drawer that I regularly use, this is the one I seem to reach for most often.  I'm diligent about brewing times.  This one is 5 min. and I set the timer.  Gives me a perfect cup every time.<br /><br />Don't forget that it's organic.  Support organic practices and do something beneficial for your body.<br /><br />This tea was a good buy and has withstood the test of time (for me)."
2694,2694,2694,2695,5,"Good beans.  I can't find these in the grocery stores where I live, but ordered them through this retailer with no problems."
2695,2695,2695,2696,5,"Adzuki ( or Azuki) beans are ment to be used in asian sweets. You can make sweet bean paste by boiling the beans for 30-40 min, (changing the water out at least twice) draining and mashing the beans with sugar.(strain the paste if you do not like the bean skins)  What you get is a paste that can be put on ice cream, fill pasteries or stuff into Mochi Cakes."
2696,2696,2696,2697,5,their not only good for you but their yummy.they smell like cloves when their cooking and taste  a little sweet.
2697,2697,2697,2698,5,Good stuff - like lentils you don't need to soak these.  They are small so feel good in the mouth.
2698,2698,2698,2699,5,"I really like this flavoring. I try to stay away from sugar and artificial sweeteners so this was perfect because it contains absolutely no sweetener so I can add my own (mostly liquid stevia).  I also love vanilla flavoring in many things I make so I sometimes use this in place of extract which can be pricey if you use it a lot. For example, I make my own almond milk so I like to add vanilla to sweeten and lighten the taste. This works better than an extract because there is no alcohol taste. I also make blueberry syrup with agave and this flavoring and it turns out very good. I put it in pancake batter and the flavor still holds after cooking (also with cookies). I use this all the time and now I am not dropping $10 every couple of weeks for vanilla extract."
2699,2699,2699,2700,3,"I wanted to love this but I just didn't. Despite being sugar free it has 15 calories per pump and in my opinion needs three pumps to add enough flavor to my iced vanilla lattes. If your going for calorie count this isn't favorable. I would however say if you think other brands are a bit too sweet or if calorie count isn't overly important you should give it a go, it may be just what you were looking for! As a side note if calorie count is unimportant I recommend their coconut cream flavor<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZU3JJ4"">Amoretti Premium Coconut Cream Syrup (750mL)</a>, its delicious!"
2700,2700,2700,2701,1,We purchased from the original website 8 flavored sugars all but the raspberry was worth the money the rest had little or no flavor at all! It was expensive and not worth the money.
2701,2701,2701,2702,5,"We've been eating this delightful cereal for several years.  My kids always feel better on gluten free foods and so do I.  Unlike the popular junky cereals, this version of a slightly chocolately cereal is light and not too sugary and it's a special treat for the kids.  I also like supporting Envirokids products - the pricing has come down to where it's nearly the same as the other mainstream cereals that are not as good for you."
2702,2702,2702,2703,5,"We received this as a gift, along with some homemade graham crackers.  My husband and I have become addicted to it.  If you love things like lemon meringue pie, you will adore this luscious,lemony spread on grahams, pound cake, etc.  Just a thin layer of this delicious confection enlivens your taste buds with an explosion of flavor.  I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a very special treat."
2703,2703,2703,2704,5,I have never tasted any better! Need to keep refrigerated or it will lose color and flavor but is worth the price.
2704,2704,2704,2705,5,"Mixed with whipped cream and blueberries this lemon curd is a delicious, easy, quick summertime dessert that will delight any guests."
2705,2705,2705,2706,4,"The popcorn itself is yummy, just be warned that we had trouble popping it using our air popper.  The kernels were too light and would blow out of the popper before they were popped.  It's great in the microwave or a pan, but maybe the larger white or yellow would be a better match for an air popper."
2706,2706,2706,2707,5,"I won't claim to be a professional food taster ... I just know what I like and don't like.  I don't like ""yellow"" popcorn, I don't like microwave popcorn, I like the ""white"" popcorn cooked in a pan.  For my ""popping style"" the Baby White pops great w/o lots of hard kernels.  'nuf said."
2707,2707,2707,2708,4,"This is really good. Tender, a little sweet. Easy to make in the Whirley Pop, and excellent with some Cheddar & Spice popcorn seasoning!"
2708,2708,2708,2709,4,"I was a little concerned to buy the popcorn, as you never know what you are going to get.  But I did and I am glad I did.  The popcorn is nice and tender, pops easy, great taste and hull-less.  I have moved from the microwave popcorns and glad I did because of this product.  I like the fact the the popped corn is small but great!"
2709,2709,2709,2710,1,"I love the popcorn, but the shipping costs are INSANE!! A total rip off. Wabash Valley Farms or Amazon or whoever is charging the shipping is out of their mind. 5 Stars for the popcorn. Minus 4 stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping. Argh...Yes, the popcorn is tender and luscious, and it melts in your mouth like you're eating cooked grasshoppers, but come on!!! Can't you ship this product for less?<br /><br />Shipping the 6 pound bag is even worse. *sigh* Too bad really."
2710,2710,2710,2711,5,"We like the much harder to find ""white"" popcorn over the more common ""yellow"" popcorn and Amish Country Baby White is our absolute favorite.  We usually order 3 of the 6 lb bags 'cause we go thru it so quickly."
2711,2711,2711,2712,5,I love this popcorn. Only downside is the shipping and packing. Cost almost as much as the popcorn. Need to pack it better. Bag split and a bunch of loose popcorn falling out of the box when the guy brought it to my door.
2712,2712,2712,2713,2,"I purchased the baby white by accident.  We usually get the medium white, which is great.  The baby is so small when popped that the taste and texture of the hull shell really overwhelm it."
2713,2713,2713,2714,2,"Tasty, small kernel popcorn. However, too small and too light to be popped in a hot air popcorn popper. The kernels are blown out of the popper before they are popped."
2714,2714,2714,2715,3,The gourmet corn is smaller kernels than I like so would probably not buy it again.  But with their special oil and the Stir Crazy Popper every kernel pops every time.<br /><br />I will probably return to good old Jolly Time.
2715,2715,2715,2716,5,This is the best popcorn i have ever ate. I use a Whirley Popper to pop my popcorn. When you eat this baby white hulless you will never go back to any other popcorn. I gave my Orville Redenbacher's  and Walmart popcorn away..To many husks. You just can't beat this popcorn. It tastes sooooo good even my puppy loves it.
2716,2716,2716,2717,5,"I first had this popcorn at my 84 year old cousin's home. I thought it was so tender and delicious, and I wanted to buy some for myself. I found it on Amazon.com believe it or not!!!  Anyway, I ordered 6 pounds of it. All 6 pounds are now gone. This popcorn is REALLY good. It is different than other popcorns I have eaten because the kernels are small and very delicate. I consider myself a pro when it comes to popcorn because I have eaten it every night since I was a little girl. I usually eat my popcorn 1 kernel at a time, but since the kernels are so small, I ate it by the handful. My only complaint is that it does cost a lot to have it shipped. I wish I could find it locally so I would not have to pay for the shipping costs. If you like popcorn, I highly recommend it."
2717,2717,2717,2718,5,OVER THE YEARS I HAVE BOUGHT A LOT OF POPCORN FOR POPPING AND I HAVE FOUND THIS SMALL BABY WHITE HULLESS TO BE THE BEST FOR POPPING AND NOT A LOT OF THE SO-CALLED OLD-MAIDS I ALSO HAD TO RETIRE MY 20 PLUS YEAR OLD WABASH VALLEY FARMS STOVETOP POPPER IT WAS A GOOD ONE SO IF YOU LIKE POPCORN AND WHO DOESN'T THIS POPCORN AND POPPER COMBINATION IS THE BEST AND THE POPPER COMES WITH A 25 YEAR WARRANTY AS WELL MONEY WELL SPENT YOU WILL NOT DISSAPOINTED WITH EITHER OF THEM SO ENJOY
2718,2718,2718,2719,5,This is the best popcorn I have ever had.  As a kid I ran the popcorn machine in a theater so I feel I know what I'm talking about.  We used yellow popcorn but I still think white is best.
2719,2719,2719,2720,4,"Baby white popcorn from Wabash Farms pops nicely, has no meanacing hulls to get into your teeth, and is very tasty. What more could you ask from a popcorn? I highly recommend this product. At least a four star."
2720,2720,2720,2721,5,"The small, white popcorn is the best!  Very delicious - and I've tried lots."
2721,2721,2721,2722,5,"This was the sweetest, smallest, hulless, best tasting white popcorn I have ever had.  Just placed an additional order for a 6 lb. bag as well as other varities carried by this company."
2722,2722,2722,2723,5,Great popcorn!! Good popping results and wonderful flavor.  Can't help but love it and I will re-order when I run out.  Recommend to one and all
2723,2723,2723,2724,4,"I love little white kernels of popped corn.  This was good stuff, but I think I'll try a larger white kernel to pop next time, my preference."
2724,2724,2724,2725,5,Pops great in the microwave.  Much better than many store brands.  Good product.
2725,2725,2725,2726,3,"I was disappointed.  I thought being Amish and according to the advertising that it would be exceptional.  But it's just popcorn, no better than others I've purchased.  So, so. I would not buy it again."
2726,2726,2726,2727,4,"My doctor told me I must eat ""hulless"" popcorn if I have popcorn at all.  Because I can't give up my favorite snack, I bought this Wabash Famnily Farms Amish Country popcorn.  The kernels are tiny, but they pop well, although not as big and fluffy as the popcorn I get from the grocery store.  It tastes great, however, and has fewer and smaller hulls.  I don't think there is such a thing as completely hulless,but Ido notice thst I don't get the hulls stuck in my teeth anymore."
2727,2727,2727,2728,4,I ordered 3 6lb bags with free shipping because of the reviews. I really like it but the real test was my wife's opinion and we also ordered 4 and 1/2 lbs of popcorn from the Boulder popcorn co and the kernels were a little smaller and tasted better. We use coconut oil and it has very good flavor even without butter. I really like the Cambria's Cream kernels the best
2728,2728,2728,2729,5,"I just made some in my Whirley Pop.  It really is lighter and crisper than the larger, yellow kernels.  None of those large hulls either.  The only difference is, it pops up much smaller than the yellow, so you need to almost double the amount of kernels used per pot.  Lovely homemade popcorn."
2729,2729,2729,2730,5,"Use olive oil to cook this, salt it well, and it is the best, most tender popcorn I have ever eaten. I add a tiny bit of butter to mine, but don't need it. My nine year old daughter didn't like popcorn until she reluctantly tried this. After a few bites, she consumed half the bowl!<br /><br />I bought mine at a specialty popcorn shop in Long Grove IL, so I didn't have to pay shipping costs, but when it's gone, I might have to bite the bullet and order it from here."
2730,2730,2730,2731,3,"Wish I would have read the reviews that discuss the product's performance in hot air poppers.  The PC is very tasty and light with no residual kernel shells that get stuck in your teeth...4 stars.<br /><br />Problem with using it in hot air poppers is that the kernels are too light and fly out of the machine before they pop.  Tilting the machine helps keep them inside, but it would be simpler just to find another larger kernel corn."
2731,2731,2731,2732,4,"We've enjoyed this popcorn every bit as much if not more than the Movie Theater Popcorn.  It's light and fluffy - tender - and delicious.  I think we enjoy it a bit more because we know there is no ""palm"" oil or coconut oil in it - we can control what oils we add or leave out.  It works well with the popper - in fact just last night we had a popper full of this corn and followed it with the other because we had purchased so much of the other - we enjoyed this more."
2732,2732,2732,2733,2,"Popcorn has grear color (white)  But taste is average and due to shipping costing more then product, I would not buy again."
2733,2733,2733,2734,5,"I bought the Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper several months ago, which (of course) the Wabash Valley popcorn came recommended (same company). I thought...what the heck; I've always wondered how ""gourmet"" popcorn differed from Orville or other everyday popcorn brands.<br /><br />Let me tell you...IT IS WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY! I can really taste the difference in quality. AND, ""normal"" popcorn just doesn't taste right when you make it in the Whirley-Pop.<br /><br />This popcorn is so tender and tasty. It was a little weird to see and eat at first because it's about half the size of regular popcorn. But, I believe this characteristic is essential in helping the seasonings completely coat the corn.<br /><br />My favorite prep methods include using the Whirley-Pop and Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (see my review for that for more details!) I add a little peanut oil, sea salt, black pepper, and a good amount of Vegaline Garlic Mist Cooking & Seasoning Spray. YUMMY!!!!<br /><br />I've tried the other Amish Country popcorn, and they're all good. This is my favorite, though!"
2734,2734,2734,2735,5,This popcorn is really great!  We enjoy the taste and the smallness of the actual popcorn.  Its not like the popcorn that is big and fluffy its small and really great to eat.  I eat only this popcorn now and order every three months. Highly recommend to the popcorn lovers of the world.
2735,2735,2735,2736,5,"I bought a bowl to pop the corn in along with this popcorn. And put two handsful in the bowl and set the microwave on Popcorn. But it needed more popping for all to pop, in fact almost twice as much time. But the results are great.<br />Today we will get the seasoning I bought for it and look forward to using it to have a woderful snack while watching TV."
2736,2736,2736,2737,1,"This is  terrible popcorn! No taste, poor popping ratio. and the size OMG! I popped this Gourmet popping corn in front of a party, everyone busted out in laughter!"
2737,2737,2737,2738,1,"Do not spend your money on this product as you will find the popping ratio extremely poor. One cup of popcorn will have 1/2 cup of  un poped (old Mades) kernels left over which is unacceptable.This is a non returnable item so if you buy this one you are just out of luck, so I recommend staying away from this one."
2738,2738,2738,2739,3,"This is my first time trying Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country Baby White.<br /><br />Pros: It's okay with a nice mild nutty flavor. The hulls are more pronounced than with some other Amish ""Baby White.""<br /><br />Cons: It tends not to briskly pop up. In fact, we've burned several pans because popping it is tricky. We found that the microwave often works better than pan popping. And as mentioned above, the hulls are much more noticeable than with other Amish ""Baby White"" brands.<br /><br />We purchased these 6 bags and we'll use them up but won't be ordering any more. Next time we'll drive the long distance to our nearest Amish store."
2739,2739,2739,2740,3,If you like your popped corn small this is for you. Taste is good and it is crisp yet tender. The only real complaint is it has a disproportional amount of hull.
2740,2740,2740,2741,5,popcorn is very good.  cant believe the difference between this popcorn and the regular stuff at the story. a very good purchase.
2741,2741,2741,2742,2,"Bought 6lbs of this popcorn based on reviews that the hulls are softer on this Baby White than on regular popcorn.  Not only are the hulls just as tough as regular popcorn, the corn pops up so tiny that it's about 1/3 hull, 2/3 popped corn per kernel! I was hoping to use this as a healthy snack for my kids who love popcorn but not the hulls.<br />I popped this using every tip I could find on the internet; all experiments still resulted in a tough hull."
2742,2742,2742,2743,3,"Received the ""Baby Yellow"" instead of the correct ""Baby White"" kernels. Unable to return the product since it's a grocery item, but Amazon.com customer service did an excellent job and provided a full refund. As far as can tell, no other issues with product."
2743,2743,2743,2744,4,"I liked the idea of the small popcorn.  It pops up really well in the popper but it doesn't have much if any ""popcorn"" flavor.  Was pretty bummed by that."
2744,2744,2744,2745,4,"I used to grow the Japanese hulless in small quantities for my stovetop popper. This is the closest I can find. If you are appalled by the shipping cost, like I was, try looking elsewhere for a better deal. For instance, one popular site offers 6 lbs for $11.95 with FREE shipping if you sign up for repeating shipments (which you can cancel any time). Try www.c**king.com."
2745,2745,2745,2746,5,I have made this my popcorn of choice.  I enjoy the flavor and kernal size.
2746,2746,2746,2747,5,"Get it, Get it, Get it! This popcorn is truly the most tender, delicious popcorn I have ever tasted."
2747,2747,2747,2748,5,"Got three different Amish popcorn's for my daughter's Birthday..she is always on a diet, I got her the hot air popper same time...she & my grandson..( he's 4) loved it..she ate a bowl every night &  still lost 15 lbs !! not saying it's a diet food, just satisfiing !!"
2748,2748,2748,2749,5,I bought this popcorn as a gift for some dear friends. The have commented back several times that it's the best popcorn they have ever had. They love it!  They had shopped in the DC metro area to find white popcorn and could never find it so one look on Amazon was all it took to find this -- the best popcorn ever!!
2749,2749,2749,2750,5,"I bought this for my daughter's new microwave popcorn popper as a Christmas gift, and she says that it is delicious, but pops up smaller than other popcorn.  She likes it a lot."
2750,2750,2750,2751,5,"This is very high qulity pop corn, I recomend it.  Almost all kernels pop and they are a crisp white when they pop.  Very healthy and yummy!"
2751,2751,2751,2752,5,"Pops fully, few spare kernels with the traditional stovetop method.  Small, fluffy kernels, not a lot of 'misfires' that are only partially evolved.  My wife says they're a tad too small for her taste, but the kids and I really love this popcorn."
2752,2752,2752,2753,4,This popcorn brings me back to days before the microwave version. What a treat it was to savor the taste and lightly salted lily white popcorn that was popped over the heat of a stove burner again.
2753,2753,2753,2754,5,"I love this brand,  all kernels pop and they are a nice size, texture and flavor."
2754,2754,2754,2755,5,"I have not eaten this popcorn or tasted it myself, it was part of a gift for my daughter in Grad School.  She likes the fluffy quality of the popped corn and the not so many hulls - also the big bag makes her think she can make it last until Christmas ( that remains to be seen) without having to buy more.  A very good snack for a poor Grad Student"
2755,2755,2755,2756,5,"I'm a huge popcorn fan and have tried all sorts, and the Amish Country brand popcorn is the best I've ever eaten.  Absolutely delicious!"
2756,2756,2756,2757,5,"There are very seldom any unpopped kernels, which is nice and the flavor is wonderful. Not a whole lot to say about popcorn. I always buy from you guys and will continue to."
2757,2757,2757,2758,5,"I love white corn, in all its forms, including popcorn. And I hate how outrageously expensive the kernels are in the supermarket, so I love this popcorn."
2758,2758,2758,2759,5,"I enjoy it practically every evening, it is very good popcorn, not as much hulls and small when popped."
2759,2759,2759,2760,5,"This popcorn is much smaller than your average popcorn, and it is virtually hulless.  That is exactly what I was looking for in a popcorn because my 3 year old LOVES popcorn.  With 3 year old children, you have to be concerned with the hulls causing choking or hurting their tender gums.  My son has no trouble eating this popcorn.  It is soft and light, doesn't get stuck in your teeth nearly as much, and has a great flavor.<br /><br />This is now my popcorn of choice for our whole family.  I usually pop it in my 10 year old cheap hot air popper with no problems.  I get very few unpopped kernels. Another reviewer stated that it flies out before popping, but I have not experienced this problem (it could depend on the popper, I suppose).  I have tried microwaving it in a paper bag, but I always seem to end up burning it.  I think it takes a little more trial and error for microwaving to get the time just right, so I just stick with my hot air popper. I get great popcorn every time!"
2760,2760,2760,2761,1,I am so surprised that they have this popcorn for sale.  I received 6 bags the other day and the special popcorn pan from Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country ....GOURMET ... well.. the popped kernels are the size of a pea and with hulls.  It burns very easily.  There are too many old maids due to the delicate nature of the kernel.  I ended up throwing most of the popped corn away.  I am so disappointed in this product.  I now have 5.75 bags of this stuff ... I have nothing good to say about it ... but if you like tiny popped corn with lots of hulls then this may be your product.  I am giving mine to the squirrels.
2761,2761,2761,2762,5,"I bought this with the whirly pop popcorn popper, and I made some as soon as I got them. It is the best popcorn I've had. I thought I would mind the smaller kernel size, but I didn't. There is substantially less hull than regular popcorn. The flavor is great. I suggest using peanut oil for popping popcorn. It gives popcorn a great nutty taste - really delicious. You can buy peanut oil at any oriental (Asian) store. It's better than olive oil (olive oil and popcorn is too weird for me). But peanut oil is perfect. You won't need butter flavor or anything like that again (artificial butter flavorings are full of chemicals). Now, we pop around three times a day and always crave this for a snack instead of junkfood. Try it and you'll be popping like us."
2762,2762,2762,2763,2,"the baby white popcorn has lots of hulls when popped, very small kernels and scorched the bottom of my new whirley popper. I've had several poppers and this is the first time one has scorched and the first time I've used the Wabash corn. shipping charges were very high for a relatively inexpensive corn."
2763,2763,2763,2764,1,This popcorn has alot of hulls I order 4 bags and can't stand to eat it it's so hully - terrible
2764,2764,2764,2765,3,"The Popcorn was delivered as promised in an attractive wrapper. I used the Whirley Pop popcorn maker and used 2 tablespoons of olive oil and popped it according to the instructions of the whirley popper. While the majority of the kernels popped, there was also a large amount of 'seeds' or residue that can get caught in your teeth and are somewhat distracting while you're eating. I actually got better results using Orville Redenbacher White Popcorn Kernels in the Whirley Popper (and it was actually cheaper at the local market). Overall I give Amish Country 3 out of 5 stars and mostly for the presentation of the package than for the yield results."
2765,2765,2765,2766,1,"I ordered this because Amazon recommended it to go along with the Redenbacker popcorn popper I got from them. Hey, only a few of these actually pop! Most of these small, unpopped kernels get thrown out of the popper. What an absolute waste of money!"
2766,2766,2766,2767,3,"This is good popcorn, but it is very small so you need to make twice as much as you normally would."
2767,2767,2767,2768,1,worst popcorn ive ever bought.  chewy not fluffy.  gave it to the birds for bird food.  postage was outrageous!  just not a good experience all around.  wont be buying from them ever again.
2768,2768,2768,2769,4,"This is delicious popcorn -- lost a star because I use a hot air popper and many of them  ""jump"" out before popping.  Great flavor, great texture - tender.  I do not add anything even though I have purchased three different flavored toppings.<br /><br />Thanks,"
2769,2769,2769,2770,1,"This ""Baby White"" popcorn pops small and somewhat hard.  I have tried several batches with various adjustments of heat, using a ""whirlypop"" popcorn popper.  Unsatisfactory results!  I won't purchase this again."
2770,2770,2770,2771,2,wE LOVED THIS POPCORN  BUT COME ON  SHIPPING IS WAY OVER THE TOP  WE WOULD SETTLE NEXT TIME FOR SOMETHING WE CAN BUY BUT NOT SPEND 3 TIMES ON SHIPPING
2771,2771,2771,2772,1,"I can only go as low as 1 star on the review, though I'd like to rate it a ""0""- this item still shows in stock, but clearly isn't, which is why my order was canceled from Amazon today. Amazon suggested I search out the item again, and in doing so I see that this same vendor states the item is available. Not so.<br /><br />Technically this review does not relate to the quality of the product, just the ability to be able to ship it. Good luck!"
2772,2772,2772,2773,5,"Got this for like $10 on a warehouse deal. It was a bargain! I received them in early May and the label says best before June. At a rate of one can per 2-3 days, I don't think I'll have a problem finishing them off before June. (I know, I have a sweet tooth). All 4 cans had some dents on them but the condition of the gulab jamun inside was good. They were just as described - soft cheese balls (about 20 per can) in a sugar syrup with just a hint of cardamom. Warm it up a before eating for the maximum flavor and texture."
2773,2773,2773,2774,4,"Why is this $[...] when the same product is available for $[...] here?<br />http://www.amazon.com/VICTOR-FLY-MAGNET-BAIT-REFILL/dp/B00004RBDY<br /><br />The Victor M380 and M502 traps are unreal, of course -- total fly genocide. Pretty stinky, but only right nearby."
2774,2774,2774,2775,5,We have used the Victor fly bait for 3 seasons.  Can't beat it.  Great product!
2775,2775,2775,2776,5,"Bar Harbor clam chowder is absolutely fantastic!<br /><br />1. I am not usually a fan of soup out of the can.<br />2. I am really picky about my clam chowder.<br /><br />That said, I get this stuff in bulk.  There are several reasons for this, the first of which is the great flavor of clams and potatoes.  Second, I like the fact that the ingredients are all natural and, third, that one can adjust the level of creaminess and viscosity with what one adds to the soup (I like to use a mixture of milk and cream).  The fourth plus is that this soup contains neither bacon nor excessive amounts of spice or pepper - two things that ruin clam chowder for me.  I know bacon is popular with a lot of folks but I really just want to taste the clams when I have a bowl of New England clam chowder.  If you're like me in that respect, then I think you will like this soup too!<br /><br />p.s. As a child, I was a fan of Friendly's clam chowder (before they changed their recipe).  Bar Harbor is even better!"
2776,2776,2776,2777,5,"I've definitely had a stigma against canned anything (and still do). Picked this up at the supermarket, drawn by the all natural ingredients (for once no MSG or really anything else I didn't recognize). It's really quite good, and especially so for coming out of a can. I can have excellent clam chowder -- and with a little milk and butter, exactly to my liking -- warm within minutes. One of the few canned goods I keep in my cabinet, and one of the most convenient and surprisingly satisfying meals always 5 minutes away.<br />Highly recommended."
2777,2777,2777,2778,2,"I've just prepared my first can of this soup.  It tasted incredibly bland, and didn't have much clam flavor.  So then I added more milk, butter, onions, salt and fresh ground pepper, plus white wine.  For 2.92 per 15 oz. can, all of those ingredients should have been adequately added in there already, except for the pepper. Bar Harbor brand certainly didn't stint on the other ingredients in order to increase the amount of clams, that's for sure.  There were larger pieces of clams than in Progresso's - but that's damning with faint praise.  Next time I'll buy the clams and make my own, for less, probably.  I'm just perplexed by these reviews;  I think I can safely say Progresso's tastes better.  And, of course, it's much less expensive."
2778,2778,2778,2779,4,This is our preferred clam chowder . We like the natural taste with lots of potatoes. The only complaint is I think the soup can be creamier. Amazon has much better price on this with subscribe and save.
2779,2779,2779,2780,2,"I'm a little perplexed by all the great reviews.  This was the most bland chowder I've ever had.  I prepared it with just milk and a little butter, and it tasted like nothing!  Added some salt and white pepper, still nothing.  Added some black pepper and Provence herbs, now it tastes like herbed potato soup.<br /><br />On the plus side the clams were nice big chunks and the potatoes were tender.  The consistency was pretty good too.  It just had no flavor.  Not going to be buying this again, certainly not when it's this expensive, too."
2780,2780,2780,2781,4,"It's not as good as I hoped, but canned chowder never is. I added some butter, a can of chopped clams, and some milk - then thickened it a bit. It works great as a base, but not for me straight out of the can."

2782,2782,2782,2783,3,"I've had better canned clam chowder.  Bookbinders is one that comes to mind.  I don't buy the ones with preservatives or a long list of ingredients, so my choice is limited.  For this one, if I add just half a can of milk and a pat of butter, along with some extra sea salt, it's ok.  The longer it is gently heated -- not simmered or boiled -- to let the flavors mingle, the better it becomes.  More clams and potatoes would improve it.  As it is, the ingredients were skimpy."
2783,2783,2783,2784,5,This is the best clam chowder ever. Come originally where this is produced and was so happy when I found it on line. Keep this in my cupboard at all time. Being an old Maine girl this is my favorite chowder of all times.
2784,2784,2784,2785,5,"The best canned clam chowder I've found currently available.  Very light, nicely seasoned, creamy taste.  Not fishy or oniony.  Good amount of minced clams per serving.  To find better chowder, it would have to be homemade."
2785,2785,2785,2786,1,"Bits of ""Clam?"" (not sure) in water with something I assume is potatoes. Whose recipe is this? save your money get something worth having. How do so many like this?! It's awful! If you prefer REAL Clam Chowder and not seawater with something floating in it DO NOT buy this!"
2786,2786,2786,2787,5,"This is clearly the best canned clam chowder I have tasted. It is refreshing to have a canned soup without all the unnecessary preservatives and artificial flavoring. The can is supposed to be ""Condensed"", but if you like a hearty thick soup, it is better just heated without adding milk or water. The clams are perfect, and not over cooked. I will order again, and look forward to trying out some of the other products they have on Amazon."
2787,2787,2787,2788,2,"My local store had the product lineon close-out at 77 cents a can so I bought a dozen cans of different verities. Lobster soup was very fishy for starters and the Manhattan chowder was very watered down.  The New England chowder is somehow creamy and void of flavor.  The Clam corn chowder was not enjoyable.<br /><br />  I am real soup eater and take soup at least once a day and always when I dine out.  Long story short... This is the most tasteless soup and just not good.  I suggest you pass on this and I am sure Cambells will be a much better choice than these soups... Sorry, I had leave an unfavorable review bit this soup is just not worth eating and 77 cents a can I would never buy this again"
2788,2788,2788,2789,2,"I expected better from a premium Maine chowder. This is no better than, say, Snow's, which you can get for less than half the price. Not bad, but not worth the money."
2789,2789,2789,2790,1,We opened a can of Bar Harbor clam chowder and could not believe how few clams were in the chowder.  There were mostly potatoes.
2790,2790,2790,2791,5,"I used to be a buyer at a natural/organic grocery.  This is the best soup I have ever had in a can.  I am very picky about my clam chowder soup as my favorite is The Ritz Carlton's clam chowder.  Just add butter, milk/cream, and black pepper.  Have some fresh corn bread and butter and you are in heaven."
2791,2791,2791,2792,4,"For canned soup this is very good clam chowder.  Those who give it 1 or 2 stars are comparing it to homemade soup or restaurant style soup.  I would buy this any day over other brands.  You can tell it is all natural and without loaded msg, salt and other nasty ingredients.  Pure and clean soup.  Those who rate it badly, some say it has no flavor or there aren't chunks in it.  The flavor is mild, but that is good- not overwhelmingly clammy and not over salted like conventional brand canned soup.  If I want to, next time I will add a potato cut up in chunks to boost it's contents- not a big deal to do.  I would prefer to do that than buy a conventional brand that doesn't care about healthy ingredients and sourcing of ingredients.  I will buy this again- good source of iron as well."
2792,2792,2792,2793,4,Even though the chowder is very very good as is - I add a can of the Bar Harbor Chopped Clams to it - along with a can of heavy cream and a huge pat of 'budda' ....<br /><br />yummy ...
2793,2793,2793,2794,1,"Tried this yesterday as a ""treat"" on a cold, rainy fall night.  It had an unpleasant, grainy and somewhat watery texture.  The clams were actually sandy and gritty and the potatoes were kind of chalky, for lack of a better term.  The flavor was also very lacking...it didn't really taste like, well, anything.  Definitely not worth the price.  I can only imagine the people who wrote the good reviews either work for Bar Harbor or have never tried any other kind of clam chowder."
2794,2794,2794,2795,3,"We had high expectations for this product but the chowder was only average.  Warming instructions are vague as to the amount of milk and/or butter to blend in with the soup mix. We found the flavor to be bland and one dimensional, even with as little as 1/2 cup of added whole milk.<br /><br />The package of six cans contained three dented cans.  Two of them were severely dinged on the seamlines and had to be tossed.  For this reason, we will no longer purchase can goods through the mail."
2795,2795,2795,2796,3,"I just finished my first bowl of this clam chowder, and was disappointed to find, or rather, not find, clams. Don't get me wrong -- the soup was good, with a very nice texture and taste, but the clams were AWOL. Several times I bit into something that provided a small burst of clam flavor, but only once did I find a clam fragment big enough to look at. I'm going to buy some chopped clams to kind of ""chum"" a bit. This, of course increases the cost of the meal. I'm going to try some other brands as well.<br /><br />I do hope that Bar Harbor does some testing. The label shows clams as the most prevalent ingredient, but I don't see how that can be -- my money is on the potatos."
2796,2796,2796,2797,5,"I adore this chowder because it uses natural ingredients and not harmful fillers like MSG and partially-hydrogenated oil. Most importantly, this chowder tastes MOUTH-WATERING GOOD and is bursting with flavor. I use whole milk and add a pinch of pepper, and this aromatic chowder is devoured in minutes. If you have not already, definitely give it a try."
2797,2797,2797,2798,5,"Unless you've got a clam roller somewhere on your property, I doubt seriously that you could whip-up a better bowl of chowder! The clams were tender, fresh, plentiful, and remarkably non-gritty. The 'taters' were tasty and not overly done. I would recommend that they cut-back a bit on the tapioca starch and add some medium cream, instead.  I like to add some diced Vidalya onion or red bell pepper. Stir in some milk, butter, and black pepper, and you're on your way to a delightful meal."
2798,2798,2798,2799,3,"...........but still not that great. It's bland. Even when I added salt, pepper, milk, and butter, it didn't taste like the best I've had. But at least it's edible, unlike every other canned clam chowder out there. If I can find a way to make this taste better than I'd love it. It's the best CANNED clam chowder I've ever had, but it's not that great. The clams taste good.<br /><br />EDIT: I had a 2nd can and I made it today, I added only a little bit of milk and I added NO salt, pepper, or butter, and it actually tastes a lot better than when I did. So I suggest adding nothing but some milk or cream to this soup. It's still not the best I've ever had though."
2799,2799,2799,2800,4,"This soup lacks the key ingredients that make a canned clam chowder great: Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (soy/cottonseed), dehydrated potatoes, modified starches of all kinds, hydrolyzed corn gluten, MSG, potassium chloride, sodium phosphate, disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate, and succinic acid. What good is a classic New England clam chowder without these classic ingredients?<br /><br />Instead, the first ingredient listed is: Clams. Next you'll be telling me it's got butter in it (it does? Oh.).<br /><br />On a more serious note. Bar Harbor makes a good tasting clam chowder. The first list of ingredients came from Snow's and Campbell's condensed New England clam chowders. This Bar Harbor stuff is worth it."
2800,2800,2800,2801,3,I was really excited to try clam chowder from Maine but it did not wow me.  I think Campbell's might even be better....
2801,2801,2801,2802,5,"Good flavor and not too rich--fewer fat calories than the standard fare. It's not loaded up with canola oil like Campbell's and Progresso, so you can add a little quality EVOO like California Olive Ranch, or even butter for a healthier brew if you prefer it that way like we do. I also add a little half and half, and saute some Hormel Bacon bits with red onion and garlic to add complexity to the flavor. I was impressed. I usually also add some Gorton's Wild Pacific Salmon (frozen, in most markets) to basically make it a healthy fish chowder."
2802,2802,2802,2803,1,"One perfect box. No rips, tears or gouges. Inside the box? 6 badly dented cans of chowder that looked like they fell out of an airplane. Every single can! Very disappointed. Should I return them all? Is the chowder any good? Was this a joke? I rate this 1 star...for the unblemished box."
2803,2803,2803,2804,4,very good clam chowder.not as good as being in Maine in a restaurant but much better then other canned chowders
2804,2804,2804,2805,5,"bar harbor clam chowder is an excellent product. easy to fix and has tremendous flavor, nice amount of clams and potatoes. you will enjoy this product very well !"
2805,2805,2805,2806,4,"This arrived earlier than expected, which was great! However, for some reason, this particular product smelled a little like ""fish food"".... but no worries, still tasted like great cashew butter, just the smell was kinda weird - like fish food. Also, I wish this product was organic."
2806,2806,2806,2807,2,"When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a ""gravy"" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters."
2807,2807,2807,2808,3,"Our dog loves this stuff. I bought it for a occasional treat since he only eats dry dog food, I thought it would be a nice treat for him to have a lil something extra every now and then. But this stuff stinks really bad like dirt, it makes the whole area where the dog eats smell like we just opened and bag of soil in the house. If they could improve the smell of it, that would be awesome, because our dog just loves it but we can't bare the smell of it."
2808,2808,2808,2809,5,"My dog likes the Iams savory sauce.  It helps to tempt him to eat when his appetite is off, and it's good for him."
2809,2809,2809,2810,1,"I ordered this Pack of 20 1-pound full leaf tea which looked like a great deal. Well....<br /><br />1st, it's not 20lbs of tea, I received only 1<br /><br />2nd, it's not high quality full leaf tea, but rather the ground tea leaves you'd expect from lipton<br /><br />Strangely enough, I ordered the non-decaf regular version and it arrived as full leaf tea and doesn't taste half bad. If someone receives something different than I or rather if someone receives what was advertised, I'd like to know about it. Maybe I'll try again."
2810,2810,2810,2811,1,"This was the 2nd time that I ordered the Smokehouse USA Chicken Stix. The 1st order had USA printed right on the bag, this one had a USA sticker over the China sticker.  In addition, the product looked entirely different. Obviously I am concerned. I pay more to ensure I am not feeding my ""fur kids"" products from China. If it happens again, I'll stop ordering all Smokehouse products on-line."
2811,2811,2811,2812,5,I HAD READ ANOTHER REVIEW AND THE REVIEWER WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PRODUCT COMING FROM CHINA.  I CALLED THE MANUFACTURER AND WAS TOLD THIS PRODUCT IS MADE HERE IN THE US.  MY DOG LOVES THEM!!
2812,2812,2812,2813,5,"This is a new treat for our ""kids"". They are pretty picky eaters, especially my girl! They both love 'em. Glad I found this product. Reasonably priced too"
2813,2813,2813,2814,5,"I have a German Breed, G.Sheph. & he is VERY, VERY, PICKY! He loved them. He is such a happy camper. He wakes up in the morning & ready to go for his walks & comes home straight to his treat cabinet, he wants his chicken stix....thank you, finally something that my boy loves...."
2814,2814,2814,2815,3,"With the Prime shipping, this made a great last minute gift. It seems a little pricey for the amount of fish, but the quality was good (according to the person I gave it to). In the end, I think this is better than a fruit basket or something similar."
2815,2815,2815,2816,3,"I think pack of 4 for $25.00 is too much ($6.25 per box). I got them in Target for less than $3.00 sometimes. Also, maybe because of promotion, I got them for $2.80 or around that at Safeway. I will not buy this one online. TASTE is FIVE STARS, but price is ONE STAR."
2816,2816,2816,2817,4,"I eat a lot of cereal, and that includes a lot of the high-fiber kinds. Oatmeal, Mini (Frosted) Shredded Wheat and Raisin Bran are usually what I'd eat when I needed to lose a few lbs., but there have been a few instances where I tried the ""healthier"" options. I've tried several of the Kashi cereals, but they weren't very appetizing. The plain one had a cardboard taste. Next, I tried Grape Nuts, which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food (though it's closer to kitty litter in texture.) That brings me to FiberPlus Antioxidants.<br /><br />This Berry Yogurt Crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high-fiber cereals I've eaten. It's like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal. The clusters of yogurt really help, but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own. Yes, there are 12g of Sugar per serving, but the 10g of Fiber and 170 Calorie parts more than make up for it. Especially if you compare it to Raisin Bran and Frosted Shredded Wheat, which are typically higher in Sugar and Calories, yet lower in dietary fiber. The antioxidants are a nice bonus, too.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I'll add this to my grocery list whenever it's on sale or the price is right."
2817,2817,2817,2818,5,"Let me first say that I don't eat cereal as a general rule.  I just don't like it.  I don't drink milk EVER, so eating dry cereal isn't always a treat.  I purchased a box of this for my husband.  I ended up trying some because it just looked so pretty in the bowl....and I was HOOKED!  This cereal is tasty and healthy and I eat it everyday now with my yogurt.  I can't give it enough stars!"
2818,2818,2818,2819,5,"I am now on my third box of this delicious cereal. I try to eat only high fiber cereals, mainly for nutrition but also because they seem to be more filling. This is now my favorite! If you purchase the fiber plus bars, many times they have a $1 coupon on the back (off one box of cereal)  I buy mine from Wal Mart @$2.68 and use coupon...great deal. Usually lasts me a week...I eat a bowl everyday.  Also, many times you'll find a $1 coupon on cereal box for fiber bars. They are pretty good too, especially the chocolate almond."
2819,2819,2819,2820,5,"My daughter, living and working in DC this summer, introduced me to this product while home for a visit.  She encouraged me to give the plain version (just pure coconut water) a chance first, and by the second container, I understood the amazing qualities of this drink.  I felt so refreshed, hydrated, and healthy!  I later tried the kind with pineapple, which is also delicious, but I think the plain is more effective and purely refreshing when really hot, tired and thirsty, while the sweeter fruit infused version will be amazing as part of a cocktail.  Can't wait for 5:00!"
2820,2820,2820,2821,5,"This has been my favorite brand of coconut water of the ones I've tried. They use real fruit juice for flavoring, as well as it tastes good.<br /><br />We tried the smaller size, and they just aren't large enough to get enough water at the gym, and are not resealable.<br /><br />Things I like about this:<br /><br />* Perfect size for an hour long gym routine<br />* Resealable cap(smaller one lacks this)<br />* Tasty (Like a pina colada)<br /><br />Negative<br /><br />* Box makes it hard to get the last drops- usually end up squishing it up to get the last bit<br /><br />So great coconut water, perfect size, and cheaper than buying locally at sprouts with the Amazon's 'subscribe and save'!"
2821,2821,2821,2822,4,I like the slight pineapple flavor in this better than the plain coconut water. Good well chilled. Coconut water is supposed to be a healthy drink.
2822,2822,2822,2823,4,"Love this juice. Scheduled shipment is convenient and economical. This is a very expensive beverage and any way to save some money on it, is worth it"
2823,2823,2823,2824,5,"I have tried every brand of coconut water that health food stores carry, and this is, by far, my favorite.  The pineapple flavor does not overwhelm the coconut or vice versa. I also like the tetra pack with the screw on top- it is much more convenient than the smaller 11 oz size which you cannot reseal.  This has been a great Gatorade substitute for me, and helps a lot when I am sick or dehydrated or need to hydrate quickly. Great stuff!"
2824,2824,2824,2825,5,Shipping great and loved product. The boxes are a little tough because there is not a lid if you do not finish.  I suggest buy only little ones this way.
2825,2825,2825,2826,5,"I discovered Vita Coco a few months ago.  Of the flavors I have tried, I like the Pineapple best.  It tastes like a mild pina colada without the alcohol.  I love the idea of an all-natural hydrating drink that is low in sugar and high in potassium.  Whenever I am hot, thirsty or a little run-down, I find that Vita Coco Coconut Water with Pineapple really quenches my thirst, refreshes me, and gives me a little energy boost without added sugar or any artificial ingredients like the ones in Gatorade and other drinks aimed at balancing electrolytes.  An 8-1/2-ounce serving  has only 60 calories and 30 mg of Sodium (less than fat-free milk), with 515 mg of Potassium and 180% of the RDA of Vitamin C.  It's a little pricey, but if you can buy it on sale with free shipping, it's a great value.  Although I have previously purchased it on Amazon, I more recently bought it at GNC during Gold Card Week when there was a free shipping offer and a ""buy 2, get 1 free"" offer.  With a deal like that, it breaks down to less than 65 cents per 8-1/2-oz serving."
2826,2826,2826,2827,5,Pineapple is hands down my favorite flavor of Vita Coco! It not only serves a great electrolyte replenishing beverage (aka the PERFECT hangover cure) but it can also be made into a pinacolada if you just add some rum :)
2827,2827,2827,2828,4,"I really like this coconut water, but I was surprised that per 17oz box it's the same price at Wegman's.  Probably won't be ordering again unless there's some sort of discount."
2828,2828,2828,2829,5,"Heard about this drink from a friend and had to try it. Had one while traveling and loved it!!! I sat on the plane enjoying it...I was thinking, I should bought another one!"
2829,2829,2829,2830,3,I subscribe to this monthly but just got an email stating that it's changing from 17 oz. to 16.9 oz. - but no price change?  WOW that's a really lame cut to increase their profit margins.  Whatever I won't miss the .1 oz. obviously but how about messaging and acknowledging your devoted consumers.
2830,2830,2830,2831,5,"I tasted the pineapple flavor yesterday at a friend's cocktail party. She used it to mix with rum to make pina coladas. It complimented the drink so well!! The bottles are really pretty to set up and hand out at a party as well =)<br /><br />I have been drinking Vita Coco for a while now and usually drink the 100% pure, but I find the flavors to be such a treat (yet still very healthy)! Especially after a long workout."
2831,2831,2831,2832,4,"It's high-quality and the price is right, especially with subscribe-and-save via Prime, but after months of trying to keep up with my subscription, I had to put it on hold.  I'm not a big water drinker, but this stuff has a distinct flavor and when you're using it as a work-out beverage four or five times a weak it eventually wears on you.  Or me, at least. I'd still recommend it, just don't OD the way I did."
2832,2832,2832,2833,5,"Originally I was turned of by this product when I tasted the regular flavor. Once I had the version with pineapples, I was instantly hooked. I used to get a lot of stomach cramps and cramps in my feet. Since I have incorporated this drink daily it has aided my digestive system and obliterated all of my previous cramp problems. I would recommend Vita Coco to all of my friends and family."
2833,2833,2833,2834,5,"Of all the flavors Vita Coco produces, the Pineapple combination is by far the best - it has just enough flavor to keep it interesting but not overpowering."
2834,2834,2834,2835,5,The pineapple coconut combination is refreshing. I especially like that there is no added sugar. This is a welcomed change from other brands.
2835,2835,2835,2836,5,I like this product so much I have it delivered monthly!  So happy to be drinking this at work while my co-workers are stuck with pop!  It's so refreshing and revitalizing!  The only coconut water flavor I like is pineapple!  Transports easily and stores easily with the screw-on top.
2836,2836,2836,2837,5,I always feel refreshed when I drink this coconut water. The pineapple gives it an added extra that makes it truly irresistible. It has been a firm favorite of mine now for nearly a year.
2837,2837,2837,2838,5,"I tried quite a few varieties of this brand and the pineapple is the best.  Light but refreshing.  I am not sure if I think it is a miracle elixer or anything but I did purchase a case and look forward to drinking this on a regular basis.  Thank you for the great value and convenience, Amazon."
2838,2838,2838,2839,5,I use vita coco coconut water with pineapple to mix with my ultra-meal nutritional supplement it mixes well and taste great.I have it for breakfast every morning.
2839,2839,2839,2840,2,"This product doesn't have the greatest taste. I like Jamba coconut water, but it's hard product to find. I purchased this to try out and I'm not liking it, but it's tolerable when it's cold; really cold (reason why I gave it two stars).  I tried the coconut water when it was warm to see if it really tastes bad like some of the reviews said and sure enough, they were right."
2840,2840,2840,2841,5,If you haven't had coconut water with pineapple juice before then you need to try this! Simply delicious and so healthy for you!
2841,2841,2841,2842,5,"Bigger is always better, and that is not what she said, I did.  I got turned on to coconut water about a year ago and since then have not been able to get enough of it.  I found that Vita Coco, is the best brand around.  The pineapple flavor has a great sweetness that compliments the coconut water to create a refreshing, thirst quenching beverage.  I have recently began to drink more due to the nature of my job so I don't cramp up in my hands. plus with all the nutrients and benefits, whats there not too like. With subscribe and save,  I can quench my thirst any time of year.  Thanks vita coco, you surely have a lovely bunch of coconuts!!!"
2842,2842,2842,2843,5,"I love the taste of the Viva Coco with Pineapple. If I was likening it to a common drink, it's a melted virgin Pina Colada.<br />The 17 oz boxes are better for me than the other sizes, because they contain the resealable lids in case you don't drink it all at once.<br />As with all coconut waters, the taste can vary slightly, but the pineapple seems to keep it pretty consistant."
2843,2843,2843,2844,5,Good thirst quencher. Milky and thicker then I expected. Not what I would call a pineapple flavor but one can get the idea it is pineapple.
2844,2844,2844,2845,5,"I love the Pineapple/Coconut water. It is high in potassium. I am a rural mail carrier and have to be out in the hot weather. In the afternoon I get hot, dry, and thirsty. I am trying to lose weight so I'm watching my calories. Water is wet and cold but doesn't quench my thirst. This stuff does the trick. It quenches my thirst and gives me a little pick-up for the afternoon and keeps me going. This only has 60 calories per serving, so that is much less than a 180 calorie Gatorade. I recommend this to those looking for a healthy alternative to the sugary sports drinks."
2845,2845,2845,2846,5,"i love the pineapple the best. had a hard time finding this at the store,they get ya hooked and then stop carring it.i have tried the other brands of coconut water but i'm just not loving them,so i went online hoping to find this brand and there it was.now mom's happy and so is everyone else!  love the vita coco!"
2846,2846,2846,2847,5,Short and brief.  The product has a wonderful coconut taste and the pineapple addition is light and mildly sweet.  I will certainly purchase this again.
2847,2847,2847,2848,4,"I've always wanted to like coconut water - low in calories, high in minerals - but I've just never liked the taste much. The pineapple juice in this really makes a difference. It still needs to be well chilled to be good, but it makes a healthy post-workout drink."
2848,2848,2848,2849,5,I love buying these and drinking them after my workout.  You lose not just fluids but minerals/vitamins and this helps replenish you.  Water is good too for you too but I just love these post-workout.  They are also good for anytime when you could use a sweet but natural drink (like you don't want milk or soda or water but want something tasty and refreshing).
2849,2849,2849,2850,5,"After reading about the benefits of coconut water, I decided to give this brand a try.  I have tried a few other brands with a juice added, but they all have lot of extra sodium.  Be sure to read the labels.  Some have less potassium in them than the Via Coco brand.  I felt like this was better for my husband to drink than Gatorade. He works on a/c during the summer and is out in the heat all day long."
2850,2850,2850,2851,5,Love the pineapple flavor. Makes me feel like I am on vacation drinking a pina colada. (You probably could add a little rum and.....)Really tastes better than other pineapple coconut waters I have tried!!
2851,2851,2851,2852,5,"This product is a good addition to fruit smoothies.  It thins it out while adding good taste and electrolytes, which are good during the very hot weather."
2852,2852,2852,2853,5,"I love this water! I started buying it after my Bikram yoga classes to rehydrate, and now drink it whenever I feel a little dehydrated.  Living in AZ, I tend to not drink enough water so these help tremendously and are delicious too!  Try them! You'll be hooked :)"
2853,2853,2853,2854,5,Vita coco water is taste great by itself or mixed up in a smoothie. It is great for re-hydration after a workout and has more potassium than a Banana.
2854,2854,2854,2855,5,IT SAYS ON THE BOX EACH DRINK CONTAINS: THE POTASIUM OF 2 BANANAS & MORE ELECTROLITES THAN A SPORTS DRINK. THEY MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE HIGH PRICED BUT GO TO GROECERY STORE BUY 2 BANANAS & 2 SPORTS DRINKS AND YOU WILL PAY MORE TO GET THE SAME NUTRITION YOU GET FROM 1 JUICE BOX OF THIS COCONUT WATER...
2855,2855,2855,2856,5,"Great before, during, and after a workout. Great natural electrolytes, Very high in potassium, amazing drink! This is my favorite flavor, tangerine is 2nd"
2856,2856,2856,2857,5,Great real coconut young coconut taste. Not the usual overwhelming sweet taste seen on other coconut water canned drinks.  Good on the environment. Made in Brazil. Even better.  You can really taste the fruit labelled on the product besides the coconut water taste
2857,2857,2857,2858,5,"Not only does Vita coco have the best taste ..much better than ONE<br />and slightly better than Zito, but now they have the best package<br />also!!<br /><br />This new screw top is great to take to the gym, hiking and biking.<br /><br />Coc water is the best re-hyrator and IMO Vita coco is the best.<br />I also noticed when I searched coconut water on amazon.com that<br />vita coco comes up number one, so others seem to think that vita<br />coco is number one also because they are voting with thier purchases."
2858,2858,2858,2859,1,"According to an article on CNN.com on 8/5/11, the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the lable.<br />""Researchers at ConsumerLab.com tested the sodium, potassium, magnesium, and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water, and they found that only one, Zico Natural, contained the stated amount for all four ingredients.<br /><br />The sugar and potassium content in the other two brands, Vita Coco and O.N.E., also matched the label. But the amounts of sodium and magnesium--two nutrients key to hydration--were as much as 82% and 35% lower, respectively, than the listed amount."""
2859,2859,2859,2860,1,"I bought this at a local gas station near my house and was excited to try it because I see it everywhere. It was nasty. I will never drink this crap again, I don't care how ""good"" it is for you. The taste is disgusting and I'd rather just drink regular water. Blah!"
2860,2860,2860,2861,5,I'm so addicted to these!!! You know the movie When Harry Met Sally? When I drink one of these it just feels like that famous scene in the movie... orgasmic!
2861,2861,2861,2862,1,"This stuff is pretty disgusting.  I don't care if Madonna, Tom Cruise or whatever celebrity invested in the company and carries a container of it around for photo opps, it tastes bad.  And as far as rehydrating better than water, umm, don't think so.  It might replenish potassium, although, unless you are participating in the Olympics, you probably are not going to risk a potassium deficiency from physical activity."
2862,2862,2862,2863,2,"I had hoped that this would taste like Pina Coladas but it doesn't.  It is rather nasty and left a film on my tongue.  I wanted something to drink after a work out or to give to my kids when we are traveling but it is to hard for me to swallow.  The reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is good in mixed drinks.  I have been able to add it to smoothies and drinks with alcohol.  If you are going to drink this straight, it helps if it is really cold....almost frozen.  If you really like the taste of coconut milk you might like this because that is the only thing I can taste in it,"
2863,2863,2863,2864,2,"The product description says 12 packs of 12 (144 count), but when you order, you only get a box of twelve.  I did this weeks ago, talked to Amazon, but they still haven't updated the product description."
2864,2864,2864,2865,5,"High quality coca products do not have a paper wraps since they can harbor dirt and bacteria and the printing ink can change or contaminate the delicate flavor of the tea bags.<br />Organic coca tea bags do not contain preservatives or additives; therefore they must be properly stored. All coca tea  Air Tight Bags are re-sealable with zip lock closures and once opened the bags must be kept closed at all time to avoid contamination in a dry, cool, dark place away from strong-flavored foods.  An extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one month.<br />Do not store coca tea  products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside. Many fruits and vegetables, especially if they have been damaged, give off ethylene gas as they ripen. Coca tea bags are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas. The refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the generating varieties, allowing it to build up to damaging levels. Although not hazardous to humans, the ethylene gas leads to the early aging and rotting of the tea."
2865,2865,2865,2866,5,"I got a bag with 25 oinkies, pig skin with sweet potato in the middle.  But my dogs like them despite the wrong item being received.  It's still made by hartz.  The description of this product didn't say anything about sweet potato in the center.  So unless they update the description & package image I got the wrong product.  I'm only happy because my doggies are. :P"
2866,2866,2866,2867,5,"These are a great snack for any dog who has food allergies to chicken. My 20 pound Sheltie loves them more than any other chew or rawhide that we have given her. I highly recommend these for any dog, especially one with food allergies."
2867,2867,2867,2868,5,I have an old english sheepdog. He absolutely loved the treats. It took him longer than I thought it would to eat through one so I could eat a treat in peace while he chewed on his. It was great.
2868,2868,2868,2869,1,When I placed my order it was for Hartz Pigskin 10 pack with sweet potato center.  When I received the order it was Hartz Pigskin 10 packs but it was all pigskin and this is not easy for my dog to chew.  I contacted the company and they were very nice about the hole thing as they refunded the money to my credit card and told me to take the pigskin packs to a local shelter or SPCA.  They were also very fast in sending out the original product.  They told me that they forgot to change the photo from sweet potato center to all wrapped pigskin and they would do that.
2869,2869,2869,2870,5,"My dog craves these...one each morning. She's never had digestive problems with them, unlike the beef rawhide bones which we wont give her. WE couldnt find them suddenly in any of the stores and i was soooo delighted Amazon had them! Right to my door quick!  thank you amazon!"
2870,2870,2870,2871,1,"I emailed customer service and asked if the treats were filled with sweet potato, and they assured me that they'd checked with the manufacturer and confirmed that they did in fact have a sweet potato center.  However, the ones I received did not and I feel like I was lied to by customer service because they didn't want to take the time to actually check into it."
2871,2871,2871,2872,5,"Wrigleys' 5 FLARE sugarless gum is Wrigleys' sugarless replacement for their ""Big Red"" cinnamon gum. 5 flare seems to be difficult to find in stores. Thanks to Amazon I always have a supply. 5 FLARE is also the longest lasting gum I have ever experienced both in flavor and durability. It is positively the best cinnamon flavor currently on the market."
2872,2872,2872,2873,5,I love this gum.  It is very dishearting that it is so difficult to find.  I was hooked on the Cinnamon Extra until that went away.  Now this item is not available.  This world needs more Cinnamon lovers.
2873,2873,2873,2874,5,"I tried this gum after Trident cinnamon became hard to find a couple of years ago.  (Trident told me that they were overhauling the plant that made the gum so it was in short supply but it would be back.)  I quickly discovered that the Flare 5 was far superior to the Trident and I haven't looked back.  It does last a long, long, long, time.  Unfortunatley, as other reviewers noted, it has become very hard to find in stores.  Trident cinnamon is everywhere but now I don't want it.  Amazon saves the day again."
2874,2874,2874,2875,4,"I found this coffee flavorful and bold.  I didn't experience bitterness.<br /><br />For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.<br /><br />My favorite k-cups are:<br />Starbucks French Roast<br />Starbucks Caffe Verona<br />Starbucks Pike Place Roast<br />Green Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran Reserve<br />Green Mountain Double Black Diamond<br />Green Mountain Revv<br />Green Mountain Dark Magic<br /><br />Other k-cups I've tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel ,Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf, Emeril Jazzed up Decaf, Starbucks Caffe Verona, Coffee People Black Tiger,  Starbucks House Blend, Starbucks Breakfast Blend, Starbucks Sumatra, Wolfgang Puck French Roast, Green Mountain Lake and Lodge, Green Mountain French Roast, Caribou Mahogony, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya, Emeril Big Easy Bold"
2875,2875,2875,2876,5,Is so good. Lots of flavor and great coffee taste. Especially good to wake up with. Enjoy this coffee. I give it a plus 10.
2876,2876,2876,2877,5,I love how fast my cups arrived. I will always get my k cups here! I can't wait to try something new.
2877,2877,2877,2878,4,We have several of these machines at work and I've tried lots of different flavors and blends...this is one of the few I can keep down without my body convulsing with an involuntary shudder.  Lots of these instant coffees are very bitter or far too strong.  This one is actually very tasty.
2878,2878,2878,2879,5,I've tried a handful of other brands of French Roast and I find this one and Tully's version to be both great and comparable in flavor. The difference is the price (this one is far more reasonable).
2879,2879,2879,2880,4,"I have had Green Mountain coffee before, but had not tried the French Roast.  I am just realizing that there is a taste difference between different manufacturers, even with the same types of roasts.  The Green Mountain French Roast has the flavor I like and was expecting.  The price was reasonable and my order shipped quickly.  My only disappointment was in the shipping packaging.  I knew that I was ordering 2 boxes of K-cups but was surprised to see how big the shipping box was.  There was room for 3 boxes, with the extra space filled with bubble-wrap, which seems wasteful to me.  But on the whole, I am very happy with my coffee!"
2880,2880,2880,2881,4,"This coffee has a nice bold flavor, not too strong, but smooth and bold enough that you know your having a wakeful, full bodied cup of coffee that is really enjoyable.  If you like a distinctive, medium bold cup of coffee you will love this."
2881,2881,2881,2882,5,one of the best choices so far.  If you like bold coffee you will like this one  Will definitely buy again
2882,2882,2882,2883,4,"I prefer stong coffee but my husband does not like it quite so strong.  It works well for me.  The way he made it work for him, he makes a cup and a half and that suits him.  It also makes the KCup last twice as long!"
2883,2883,2883,2884,4,"Out of curiosity I compared with side-by-side with Tully's French Roast k-cups.  These Green Mountain k-cups do not have quite the full bodied flavor of Tully's.  Both k-cups are good, but if you're going after a French Roast with the most full spectrum and thickness of flavor then I'd recommend Tully's French Roast k-cups."
2884,2884,2884,2885,5,"French roast my green mountain is my favorite every day K-cup. Its a good coffee... bold yet smooth. NOT BURNT (I hate Peets and Starbucks because they taste like the burn the beans). If you like the nasty burnt taste, these probably are not for you. If you want a well balanced, bold, smooth everyday coffee these K-Cups will work!"
2885,2885,2885,2886,5,"This is great French Roast. For whatever reason, it is also cheaper (in 24-count) than the other Green Mountain Coffee roasts."
2886,2886,2886,2887,5,"I find many K-Cups are weak and not what I am used to (Starbucks), but this french roast is a pretty good subsitute to the $2 coffee I get from the store."
2887,2887,2887,2888,1,"If you love super dark, rich, bold and thick flavored coffee then this is the coffee for you...with one problem.  Personally I love coffee that embodies everything I just said.  I love esspresso and the like.  To find a K-cup that is this bold even on the 10 oz. setting is great...but there is that problem again...<br /><br />It smells, tastes, and leaves the after taste of burnt urine!  Like someone torched a public restroom and mopped the floor with coffee, then packaged it. Yum!<br /><br />There are other dark, bold k-cups out there that have a better smell, flavor and does not have a nasty after taste. You may not believe me, and that is fine, but get a sample pack before going for the 24, you'll thank me later. Try the Green Mountain Coffee Extra Bold Sumatran Reserve K-Cups. Better all around cup of coffee."
2888,2888,2888,2889,5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9Z1WS"">Planters Peanut Butter Cookie Crisps 100 Calorie Packs, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  These cookies are so tasty!  I love the peanut taste and the crispness.  A one-hundred calorie pack is just enough to get started having fun eating them, but then the limitation of the size of the package helps me put the brakes on.  Probably the most important part of weight control is portion control.<br /><br />The cookies have 3 grams fat, 0 mg Cholesterol, and 2 Weight Watchers points."
2889,2889,2889,2890,3,"It's very nice that the company put 100 calories packages out--great marketing idea.  They taste okay to me.  A bit subtle on the chocolate IHMO.  Mostly they're lightly-flavored, chocolate, wheat crackers.  They have very little nutritional value but over 39% sugar.  The 100 calories is achieved by a very light product--it doesn't weigh much.  So, 100 calories sounds great--but only if you eat but one package.  Not easy to do if you're hungry.  Still, it's a convenient snack to put in a backpack, lunch box, carry-on (now that they don't feed you much when you fly), etc. with less calories than most alternatives.  Could also tide you over between meals.  Still, I'd personally prefer something a bit healthier.  But that's why there's chocolate & vanilla--oops, they left out the vanilla!"
2890,2890,2890,2891,5,"I enjoy them a lot and so does my son. I have to say that this kind is one of my favorites. It is full of peanut butter flavor that you forget that it is only 100 cals. As for the amount you get in the bag, it is more than I expecting so I was very happy."
2891,2891,2891,2892,4,"I enjoy the Peanut Butter Cookie Crisp, but they are definitely a departure from the originals.  Still my son LOVES them so for this reason I still give it four stars."
2892,2892,2892,2893,5,"One reviewer writes that these are Oreo crackers without the creme--and they are right! These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.<br /><br />These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories, too. Excellent!<br /><br />These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. This makes them even more portable for both children and adults. Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. This way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have.<br /><br />I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that.<br /><br />I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy. They make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and/or cholesterol.<br /><br />Buy some and enjoy them today!  SMILES"
2893,2893,2893,2894,5,"I really like these.  They are so light and airy, almost like chips instead of cookies!  The flavor is that yummy OREO chocolate we all know and love!"
2894,2894,2894,2895,4,These are good but the flavor did not resemble an oreo. I purchased these along with the chips ahoy and those did resemble the flavor of chips ahoy. In my opinion these tasted like animal crackers. I will stick to chips ahoy 100 calorie packs.
2895,2895,2895,2896,5,"I have been eating the 100 Calorie Chip Ahoy for sometime. I really find that it is a filling, guilt-free snack. It has a unique taste of its own - not a `diet' food-type taste either, it taste like a `real' snack."
2896,2896,2896,2897,4,"As I get older and fatter, I seek opportunities to eat snacks that at least make a nominal attempt to be healthy.  Oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods.  However, Oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief.  Not only are Oreo cookies delicious, but I sometimes think I hear Oreo cookies calling my name as I walk by them.  Honest.  I am unable to buy Oreo cookies because if I do I know I will eat them; generally in a few days.  Not a good idea.<br /><br />Nabisco, realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods, have created a brand-identified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat, creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker.  To this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie.  However, this wafer snack, which Nabisco has decided not to call a cookie, perhaps because cookie sounds fattening, is reasonably yummy.  I have eaten these things several times and still eat them.  I actually eat them more than regular Oreos, which I count as quite a nod to health.<br /><br />You may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie.  If you are going to add the fat and calories in icing, perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular Oreo cookies.  In fact, just revel in the calories and go for the Double Stuff Oreos.<br /><br />Oreos have been around since 1912, and remain the best-selling cookie brand in history.  According to our friends at Kraft, which owns Nabisco, and which is owned by the Altria Group (renamed from Philip Morris, presumably for marketing reasons), more then 450 billion Oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence.  Though Oreo Thin Crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing, they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the Oreo name.<br /><br />Of course, you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy, but where is the fun in that?  For those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun, and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of Oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system, Oreo Thin Crisps are a lovely alternative.  Or course, you probably should avoid eating pounds of these, even with the reduced fat.  Food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you, even if it tastes good.  At least Oreo Thin Crisps do not talk to me when I walk by.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
2897,2897,2897,2898,4,"We are still six years away from the centennial for the Oreo cookie, which was first manufactured by Nabisco in 1912 as something more exciting for people to dip in their tea than the biscuits the English tend to use (it was copyrighted as the ""Oreo Biscuit"").  The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine, but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the ""modern"" Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for ""hill""), with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the ""cream"" in between.<br /><br />Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate-flavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the Uh-Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.<br /><br />But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three-prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos, bite-sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br />These are baked chocolate six-sided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now, I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans-fat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g., #56: ""Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees"").  Of course, I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit."
2898,2898,2898,2899,3,"With any low fat or low calorie food, you're going to sacrifice taste of portion size.  With this product, you sacrifice both.<br /><br />It's a good idea, which was done well with the Oreos and others in this series of ""100 calorie"" snacks, but I think you're better off with a single cookie from the regular Chips Ahoy box than a whole bag of these."
2899,2899,2899,2900,5,"Love this snack.<br />Its really tasty.<br />Filling for my wife, not me though...""I'll take 2 please"" =)"
2900,2900,2900,2901,5,"how good these cookies really are.  They're delicious, satisfying, and really, really healthy.  Definitely a great alternative to ""real"" cookies."
2901,2901,2901,2902,4,"FIRST THOUGHTS: BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES<br /><br />When I recently tried these little wafers I recalled when I worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE<br /><br />Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, ""100 calorie packs"" -- 4.5 inches across!<br /><br />WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + ""ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS"" & ""ARTIFICIAL COLORS"" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL<br /><br />2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES<br /><br />As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history."
2902,2902,2902,2903,4,"I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of ""A Star Is Born"" the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are ""100 Calorie Packs"", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack."
2903,2903,2903,2904,5,"Nabisco knew if they didnt put little things that give this much pleasure in little baglets, we would keep dipping our hand in the bag and in a couple years would all weigh 400 lbs, die an early death and no longer be able to give Nabisco money.<br /><br />Kidding aside, these are loveable. The texture is perfection. If you feel like chewing them quickly or take it slowly and let the light wafer melt in your mouth."
2904,2904,2904,2905,2,"I was sorely disappointed in these cookies.. They are pretty tasteless and damn hard too.. I wouldn't buy them again and I've certainly tasted much better low-cal cookies.. I definitely recommend saving your money, folks.."
2905,2905,2905,2906,5,"When you have a craving for a sweet but you don't won't too much, this bar is just perfect.  It's yummy."
2906,2906,2906,2907,5,"I don't usually like really crispy cookies, but the taste of these changed my mind.  I like that you get quite a few for only 100 calories.  I often go for ""quantity"" over ""quality"" so I would rather have a few thin crisp cookies than one regular cookie."
2907,2907,2907,2908,5,These are our favorite indulgence at 100 calories for a sweet fix and energy- they are the best!  Sad to see on Amazon they are no longer available ;-(<br />Quick shipping and they arrived safely!
2908,2908,2908,2909,5,These cookies are just enough when you crave a sweet little snack.  My 3 yr.old granddaughter likes to say the letter<br />before she pops it in her mouth.
2909,2909,2909,2910,5,"These 100 calorie Cakesters are delicious!  Both the vanilla<br />and the chocolate are great, they satisfy those little ""sweet""<br />cravings and its only 100 calories for three little cakes!"
2910,2910,2910,2911,4,"Let me begin by saying that I do not like Oreo cookies at all. I think the cookie part is bitter and I hate the white cream filling. When a friend suggested I try these I was reluctant and kept telling her that I was not interested. She insisted so I tried a few and surprisingly did not find them to be bad at all. I'm diabetic, so this is not a snack I will be eating often, but a few here and there won't hurt. If you're expecting these to taste like Oreo cookies (I'm one who's glad they didn't!!), then you'll be disappointed. But if you want a chocolate snack that's low in calories and fat please give these a try."
2911,2911,2911,2912,4,"Growing up on Oreos and milk is common. So I was taken aback with the brand extension of Oreo's to cakesters. And while I had low expectations, I must say these are better than normal Oreos. Although I can't say it'll beat the combo of oreos and milk, these are fantastic treats and relatively guilt-free.  If you like cake and like Oreos you can't go wrong with Oreo cakesters.<br /><br />The filling will bring you back to your childhood while the cake will provide you with a whole new Oreo experience. Certainly worth a try - guaranteed enjoyment!"
2912,2912,2912,2913,5,"I have recently joined Jenny Craig as  I need to lose some weight, and these 100 Calorie Pack cookies are the greatest thing for snacks.  I appreciate the opportunity to get them from you so reasonably. I have agreed to take a shipment each month."
2913,2913,2913,2914,5,"I loved the original Oreo Cakesters when they first debuted. But, I shied away from eating them on a regular basis because of the high calorie and fat content in each serving. So, when I saw the commercial for the 100 calorie version, I could hardly wait to try them, and I must say I am very impressed!<br /><br />While some of the 100 calorie snack cakes can have a dry, mealy consistency, these cakes are moist, decadent and taste 100% like the originals.....just smaller. I would recommend them to anyone who liked the original version, but is watching calories. Good job Nabisco!"
2914,2914,2914,2915,5,"My family is on the last box.  My oldest daughter ate most of the cookies.  She likes peanut butter more than anything, and these 100-calorie pouches had just the right amount and they taste great."
2915,2915,2915,2916,4,These are more like a cracker - good for a little fill in for between meals.
2916,2916,2916,2917,2,Chips Ahoy cookies were not very tasty.  My children and husband would not eat them.  I tried to give them away and everyone refused.
2917,2917,2917,2918,5,Super yummy! Really hits the spot when I want a chocolatey snack that won't break the calorie bank.
2918,2918,2918,2919,5,Such an easy way to buy calorie controlled snacks.  The arrived quickly.  So easy to take to work or when you need just an easy snack.
2919,2919,2919,2920,5,"I absolutely love the Oreo Thin Crisps cookies <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9Z1WI"">Oreo Thin Crisps 100 Calorie Packs, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. They taste great and satisfy my chocoholic craving without compromising my diet."
2920,2920,2920,2921,5,"Of all the 100-calorie pack snack products I've tried (and there have been many!) these are my absolute favorites. The funny thing is that I don't even like Oreos, and am not that crazy about chocolate. However, these Thin Crisps are exactly that, thin and crisp. They are also just right to fend off sweet cravings or premature hunger."
2921,2921,2921,2922,5,"They melt in your mouth!  I think I found my perfect snack.<br />I love Oreos, but hate all the fat they provide to my diet.  By diet I mean the ability to eat everything in moderation.  I monitor how much fat I ingest for many reasons, health being the most important.  One package of these cookies had the same great taste of oreos with only 1/4 of the fat.<br />I also like the fact that they come in individual packages:  They don't go stale;  you can take them on trips, movies, park, etc.<br />Great tea or coffee cookies too!.... and, of course, good old milk."

2923,2923,2923,2924,4,"Dude, these things are pretty good... as long as you're not bent on them being just like Oreos. I mean, they're not. But I definitely like them better than other chocolate cracker snacks like teddy grahams. The lightness of the crackers makes them perfect for slathering on other goodies, like peanut butter, cream cheese, icing, pudding, melted chocolate..."
2924,2924,2924,2925,5,"These are great snacks for traveling, such as, by airplane or car.  The cookie comes in the shape of a small cracker.  The cracker is less messy than a cookie which can break apart and crumble; and for this reason a preferred treat.<br /><br />The texture is comparable to a medium crunchy chip and very light to eat.  The first response by most people when eating the cracker for the first time is, ""Humm these are good!""  This is a pleasant response and these crackers will probably be a big success over time."
2925,2925,2925,2926,3,"Sorry, but I wasn't terribly impressed by these light snack crackers. Okay, I admit that I never liked Oreos that much in the first place. This 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like Oreos, for sure--minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling. But as one other reviewer noted, they're not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, they're not so good for you. If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense. It not only costs less, it's got lots more nutritional value, not to mention fibre."
2926,2926,2926,2927,5,"Who doesn't love Oreo cookies?  Many of us well remember after school snacks of Oreo cookies and milk.  However, also for many of us those school days when we could eat all we wished and not gain an ounce are in the past.  So, it's a special treat that brings back all kinds of good memories to find Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br /> No, I was not one who pulled the cookie apart to lap the frosting, I just loved the chocolatey taste and that is all in these cookies less the unwanted cals. They're crispy, crunchy, chocolate wafers - a wonderful comfort snack.<br /><br /> A high five for Oreo Thin Crisps!<br /><br />  - Gail Cooke"
2927,2927,2927,2928,5,"I was one of fifty families chosen to receive Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for free to do a product review on.  Once I received my Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters in the mail, I and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediately.<br /><br />The box of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters comes with five individual packages.  Each package is 100 calories.  In fact, the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are advertised as being 100 calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved.  Each 100 calorie package comes with three Oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirty-three and one third calories.<br /><br />The appearance of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness.  They are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly.  When you put a Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters into your mouth, they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor.  In fact, they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake.  The Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling isn't as easily tasted or rather it wasn't possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but I didn't have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsons.<br /><br />My oldest grandson ate almost two 100 calories packs of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters minus one or approximately 167 calories.  He enjoyed eating them and even gave Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters his `lick of approval' to the wrapper they came in!<br /><br />My youngest grandson isn't able to communicate effectively verbally (he's special needs) but I considered his dedication to eating his Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his 100 calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately 134 calories.<br /><br />I definitely give the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters a thumbs up.  I believe that I really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two 100 calorie packs or 200 calories worth of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters that I ate. I honestly didn't mean to eat both 100 calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so, I ate it.  But luckily I know that all I had was 200 calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at all!<br /><br />I like the fact that the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are presented as a 100 calorie pack.  I found the thought comforting especially since I ate two packages of them!  I even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too!!  I am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me.  I think the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you don't want to overindulge.<br /><br />If I have any complaint about the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters, it would be that they are too small!!  But since that is actually part of their appeal, I don't consider their small size a problem.<br /><br />I do recommend Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you."
2928,2928,2928,2929,5,I love Oreos but hate the filling.  These prevent me from having to scape the filling out and they're good for you - calorie wise.
2929,2929,2929,2930,1,"These things are NOTHING like Oreos.You think wow Oreos. Think again. I would say spend your money on something better (the Hershey's or Reese's crisp wafer bars come to mind). My honest view on these ""thin crisps"" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones."
2930,2930,2930,2931,1,"To be honest with you, I got these at a store. You think wow chocolate chips, and Oreos. Think again.For those that think these are so good, I would recommend the Hershey's or Reese's crisp wafer bars. My honest view on these ""thin crisps"" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones."
2931,2931,2931,2932,1,"These things are low cal oreo's: minus the creme, minus the cookie! The title ""oreo"" is basically a total misnomer. These are nothing but black crackers with some sugar. If that is what you want, then click purchase."
2932,2932,2932,2933,4,"These arrived in the middle of May and they have an expiration date of the first week of July. This means I have to eat a lot of these in the next few weeks! Just beware if you're planning on stocking up for the future...the future will get here very soon with these!<br /><br />It's also interesting that the box inside the Amazon box says ""For internal use only"". I'm not sure what that's about!"
2933,2933,2933,2934,5,"They all taste really good. It comes in Mango, Strawberry, and Red Bean. They are each individually wrapped so you only have to eat one at a time. There are 20 of each flavor as well. When I finish this canister I plan on buying another. *^^*"
2934,2934,2934,2935,2,"Well, when I bought this item....I thought it would be a direct Japan import.  It is Taiwanese.<br />It was bought at Costco and resold....(the price label was still the product.)<br /><br />The product can be bought at Costco for half the price...if not less.<br /><br />The expiration date was not printed on the product....which makes me think it was expired.<br />I believe this as most of the mochi is dry and tough..<br /><br />Will shy away from this product."

2936,2936,2936,2937,5,"I got this after a mention in the NY Times and immediately became an addict.  It's a little hot but not too much, and it has an amazing depth of flavor -- a lot more than the plain version.  I use it in chicken salad to cut back on the amount of mayo, to add flavor to blah soups and as a substitute for a lot of the oil in salad dressings.  A little bit over steamed veggies and added to yogurt over baked potatoes (instead of sour cream) is also great."
2937,2937,2937,2938,5,"My aged cat has a very sensitive stomach and she cannot eat most cat foods available. However, she has absoloutely no problems with this. Not once in all the months i've been feeding her this has she ever vomited in any way. Not to mention she's acting healthier and seems stronger on this brand.<br /><br />And she easily eats this dry without having to add any wet food to make it palatable. She clearly likes the taste.<br /><br />All in all I highly recommend this to anyone with a senior cat."
2938,2938,2938,2939,5,"I don't know why Science Diet is being referred to as junk food, as it is one of the higher quality foods on the market. A lot of the new organic and natural cat foods are not as healthy for pets as they are cracked up to be. But regardless, my veterinarian wanted me to put my 2 year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine. After some comparisons, Science Diet Mature Adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food. Both my cats, the younger one and the older (10) are on this food and they seem to enjoy it. They both graze all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to overfeed them. My younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy :)"
2939,2939,2939,2940,1,This comes in a case of 24 so I bought one can locally before ordering the large amount.  Good move!  I have 3 cats and none of them would eat it. This review is for the mature gourmet beef entree. Haven't tried the other favors yet.
2940,2940,2940,2941,1,"I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo."
2941,2941,2941,2942,1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."
2942,2942,2942,2943,5,"This is the perfect food for my cat & in fact, the only one she will eat - wet or dry."
2943,2943,2943,2944,1,"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.

One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck."
2944,2944,2944,2945,2,"Although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced.  The cans say it is minced but it isn't, it is ground beef.  My cat ONLY likes minced.  Not chunks, not ground.  Although she will eat ground cat food sometimes, it has to be inviting and delicious, yet she just walks away from this.<br /><br />I hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product.  The shipping was speedy and the value is great (as long as they deliver what the promise) now I am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all."
2945,2945,2945,2946,3,"I ordered this because it is Science Diet and it says it is minced. Well, it is NOT minced and my cats do not like it. It is more of a pate than minced and gets mashed down in their bowl so they can't eat it. I am very unhappy with this product and my cats are too. Will not be buying it again. Returning it would be not worth it as the shipping charges are taken out of the balance so I would be losing money."
2946,2946,2946,2947,1,"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags.

2947,2947,2947,2948,1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."
2948,2948,2948,2949,1,"I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0"">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>"
2949,2949,2949,2950,3,"This food is working well for my 19 1/2 year-old-cat with kidney problems.  But I can't find any info on how many cans are included for this price?  I'm guessing 24 cans based on shipping weight and the price, but I won't buy without better info."
2950,2950,2950,2951,5,"A friend brought a bag of this tea back from a trip to Taiwan, and shared it with his coworkers. I was amazed when I drank my first cup. The best word to describe the mouth feel is buttery. It's a wonderful, clear and elegant tasting tea. I've never had anything like it, and can't wait for it to become available. Everyone he shared it with wants to buy some. A Japanese friend who has been drinking green tea all her life said it was a special experience to taste this tea. Please offer it soon!"
2951,2951,2951,2952,2,"Sent this as a gift, and found out later that many items were stale.  They loved the thought, though, and loved the way it looked."
2952,2952,2952,2953,5,"BEST coffee I have ever tasted.<br /><br />My wife, neighbors and friends are all CRAZY over Jamaican Me Crazy!!!<br /><br />You must try it!!!"
2953,2953,2953,2954,5,"I love coffee anytime of day. But sensibly I drink decaffienated coffee during afternoon and evening hours. And a flavored coffee is a real treat. But some can be overpowering. This ""Jamaican Me Crazy"" flavor not only suits my personality(HA), it is very pleasing to the palate. The flavoring is very subtle while allowing the full flavor of the coffee to be enjoyed. And oh, the aroma is delicious! Both while grinding the beans and brewing the coffee. I will definitely purchase this again."
2954,2954,2954,2955,4,"I was looking for a wheel. You know, like the one sitting at the bar at a restaurant. I wanted to offer some broken pieces along with olives, pepperoni, and some prosciutto.  All for a New Years eve party. Well it was not a wheel - thank goodness because it was half a wheel and at 20 pounds for the half wheel, 40 pounds would have been way too much. The flavor was excellent, just enough of bite.  The creaminess of the cheese really came through and was a perfect balance. I broke up the half wheel into thirds and decorated a tray with a cascading effect of broken pieces. It was all well received with the choices of red wine. There was more than enough, which has allowed me to enjoy the flavors for other favorite dishes for a couple of more weeks. I am looking forward to ordering this again - Super Bowl is right around the corner. It is big, so make sure you can carry and store this quantity. As far as cost, I thought it was a great deal since it seemed to have much less rind than what we purchase elsewhere. The cost per pound may be average, but the amount of actual usable cheese is there with the great flavor."
2955,2955,2955,2956,5,absolutely delicious  have tried it on everything from meat and fish to scrambled eggs highly recommend it
2956,2956,2956,2957,1,I did not know anything about chutney until I went on a known recipe cite and found out that they mix the fruit with peppers and vinegar! I thought chutney was a different form of Marmalade but I was wrong!
2957,2957,2957,2958,5,"i have started the extraction process less than a month ago, and so far it looks and smell wonderful. waiting to try it.i have put 6 oz in 1.75 liters of vodka and now have a beautiful brown fluid that as i stated earlier smells wonderful. I plan on using the other 2 oz. in some homemade vanilla frozen icecream etc."
2958,2958,2958,2959,5,"Wifey bought these for me for Christmas.  I used to work with a guy who would bring still warm home roasted peanuts to work.  After he left I wanted to try it myself.  These were great. 25 minutes in the oven with one stir and they are done. They taste better than any grocery store peanuts ever could.  I might shell some of them and try honey roasting too.  I see a lot of people boil them, what are boiled peanuts like?  You don't see them up here in RI and I've never tried them."
2959,2959,2959,2960,5,"Same great taste as the honeybush tea bags, but so much more green!  Thank you for packaging this in bulk!"
2960,2960,2960,2961,5,"We use this in place of sugar for almost everything.  It has a light flavor, sort of similar to honey without the crystallization and the strong flavor.  The best part is the lack of sugar highs and crashes due to its lower glycemic index."
2961,2961,2961,2962,5,I was truly amazed at how great this product is. The flavor is everything that you can expect from a sweetner that is this pure! I will be ordering it again and I will try the other flavors as well!
2962,2962,2962,2963,5,"Buy these cookies. You will not regret it.<br /><br />They are, hands down, the best store-bought chocolate cookies out there, and I buy every new brand that comes out (from Mrs Fields to all the permuatations offerred by Pepperidge Farms).<br /><br />These are much better than Entenmann's recent incarnation of ""new recipe"" chocolate chip cookies, the milk chocolate chip and ""soft baked"" chocolate chip cookies. Both of these newer cookie species are awful: the milk chocolate tastes like rotting bananas and the cookie part tastes like all the other crappy store-bought soft cookies out there.<br /><br />In contrast, Entenmann's Original Recipe chocolate cookie is a mind-blowing experience: delicious dark chocolate chips and a soft mouth-watering cookie with a unique but ineffable taste. They seem to have perfected the ratio of flour to sugar, so that the cookie is delicious without weighing you down with excessive sugary sweetness (this is again in contrast to their horrible new cookies).<br /><br />I have absolutely no idea why Entenmann's decided to nearly eliminate their sales of the classical recipe and replace it with these disgusting brands. It seems to have happened when the Entenmann name was bought by a larger multinational company, so it was probably a money-saving opportunity. The Original Recipe cookies likely have expensive ingredients.<br /><br />The only problem is they are so hard to find: thank goodness they are now on Amazon!!!"
2963,2963,2963,2964,1,"I received this box with great anticipation since they don't sell these on the west coast. I got the package, opened the box and was EXTREMELY disappointed. The cookies looked like a gorilla shook the box to death and left most of the box filled with crumbs. AND THERE WAS A RODENT SIZED HOLE ON THE SIDE OF THE BOX!!!!!!!! So, needless to say I will not NOT be reordering these again."
2964,2964,2964,2965,5,"I found Wild Thymes many years ago and have continued to use their products - the Lemon Salad Refresher is my favorite salad dressing, it is light, now cal, and very tasty. Excellent on any green or pasta salad and especially good on fresh Heirloom tomatoes with fresh avocado slices. Yum! Their Customer Service is excellent and helpful, and the site shares some great recipes as well. I'm a fan."
2965,2965,2965,2966,2,"The shipping was very fast, but so was the expiration date.... got it on Feb. 14, 2012 expiration is April 4, 2012 (only 6 weeks before it expires).  Who can eat so much seaweed in such a short time??????  I should have returned it, but who wants to go through all the trouble.  Well I stuffed it all in the freezer and hope it will be still eatable.  That's what you get when you order food online.  I will not order it again!!!!"
2966,2966,2966,2967,5,I have purchased these though a local source for four dollars for a pack of eight. If you are not sensitive to MSG then these are a delicious alternative to other salty snacks. The seasoning is tasty and the thin sheets of seaweed are lite and crispy! I eat them two or three packs at a time...25 calories per. Love them!
2967,2967,2967,2968,1,"I was disappointed when I received this shipment, as the seaweed contains MSG, and it's not listed as an ingredient.<br />Amazon was very gracious and refunded me the amount of purchase."
2968,2968,2968,2969,5,My little ones love seaweed and rice and this seaweed did not disappoint.<br />other brands are too oily or salty or not enough.  This one though is just right.<br />I would be buying it again... and again.
2969,2969,2969,2970,5,"Great for sushi, or for use with Korean kim-bob, or maybe just as a snack. Lightly salted, great crunch, and will support, rice, beef, pork, even fish.<br />Or a vegetable or two."
2970,2970,2970,2971,5,"I found this stuff to be very tasty, great with jasmine rice or just as a snack. I don't mind a little MSG if it enhances the flavor."
2971,2971,2971,2972,5,"This coffee was really good.  Been trying to find it in New York, but haven't been able to.  I think it's worth the few extra bucks to get it delivered.  I've ordered twice now and each time the coffee comes fresh and still very aromatic.  Also, I think the caffeine content is pretty high, as I'm more awake on this brand then other brands like starbucks and fairway market brands."
2972,2972,2972,2973,1,"My local Walmart and Target both have this, ground or whole bean, at a regular price of less than $9 per 12 oz. bag. It's WAY overpriced here.<br /><br />It is an excellent coffee - I'm drinking it as I write this: an interesting hint of woody, creamy, citrusy taste that's dark but without the burnt aftertaste that comes with many dark roasts."
2973,2973,2973,2974,5,"This is my family's favorite brand of wheat free gluten free cake mix. This brand is moist, tasty and closer to the traditional cake mixes  people are used to. Namaste products are the best in my opinion of what's available out there in health food stores. Try it! You won't be disappointed."
2974,2974,2974,2975,3,"I ordered this thinking it would be a yellow cake mix.  It is a heavy cake and is brown. That said, it comes in handy to make streusel coffee cake, upside down cake and other augmented recipes because it is a basic mix and in those recipes the heaviness isn't a problem.  Plain cake though was disappointing.  So get creative instead."
2975,2975,2975,2976,2,"I made cupcakes with the vanilla cake mix.  They were just ok.  They were dense, but not overly so.  So that wasn't too bad. The flavor, however, is where I was disappointed.  The vanilla flavor was so subtle that I missed it entirely, and I felt like there needed to be a little more sweetness (which probably would have also made them a bit more moist). The child I made them for only ate a few bites."
2976,2976,2976,2977,1,I tried vanilla cake mix and pizza crust mix and was disappoined in both.  They had a medicinal bitter taste and even smelled strange.  I threw both items away.
2977,2977,2977,2978,5,I added 3 tbsp of sugar and half tsp of pure vanilla and a pinch of alum  free baking powder and  coconut oil for oil  and it came out soo good. My son loved it . I liked it too. The fact that it's all the major allergens free makes it better.
2978,2978,2978,2979,5,"Excellent for GF.  Not bad on it's own but I have used it as a basis for coconut cake, pineapple upside down cake, tres leches cake and others."
2979,2979,2979,2980,5,"I think Namaste Gluten Free Spice Cake Mix is their best but vanilla cake is pretty good,too. I especially like it with whipped cream and strawberry sauce with a dash of ground orange peel. In my oven,the mix bakes better in muffin cups or a muffin pan than in a rectangular pan."
2980,2980,2980,2981,4,"I've made these twice in cupcake form, topped with red jam and powdered sugar. Of course it doesn't taste like a normal vanilla cake... more grainy in texture, with a subtle sweetness, and some  spice.<br />But I think they are super tasty. They didn't suffer from the weird chewy texture I often run into with rice-flour based mixes. Also used EnerG egg replacer with no problem."
2981,2981,2981,2982,4,"I used this mix to make a 9x13 cake in a glass pan using grapeseed oil, spring water, and free range eggs.  I thought the cake had a nice flavor to it but it was not what I was expecting.  I was craving a white cake (like wedding cake) and went to my local store to find something wheat-free, gluten-free and dairy-free; I purchased this vanilla cake mix.  I think it is a very good mix.  I couldn't really taste the vanilla flavor but thought it had a nice flavor.  The cake is yellow, dense (but not like a pound cake) and texture-y like brown rice has more texture than white rice.  I thought the sweetness was just right.  I think I would purchase again but would make pineapple upside down cake with it."
2982,2982,2982,2983,5,"This mix allowed my little one to have cupcakes at his second birthday party.  They turned out great and with some homemade vanilla icing, they were a hit with everyone!  I even used Ener G's egg replacer to replace the multiple eggs the mix calls for.  One hint, bake for almost the maximum time on the directions.  They come out golden brown and moist."
2983,2983,2983,2984,1,"The chocolate cake is fantastic, so I had reason to think that this would be as well - not the case.  It was very dense & tasteless - totally unlike the airy, tasty chocolate.<br />I want my money back or an even exchange for the chocolate cake mix."
2984,2984,2984,2985,5,"This tea is hard to find - it was a joy to find it on Amazon.<br /><br />Large package -6 full size boxes arrive all for enjoyment!<br /><br />Sugar plum is a delicious, sweet, warm, feel good tea. Reminding you of Christmas. It has that spice palate of warm hibiscus, barley, rosehips. I think what I like most of all is the sweet aromatic taste. One of those tastes that makes you feel taken care of - a special treat when you are little. Like when mom or dad would make you hot coco or something you like that was so sweet and rare and ONLY on those special occations.<br /><br />I adore this tea and rather drink anyother tea.<br />I am so happy to have found it!"
2985,2985,2985,2986,5,This tea makes me sleep better than sleepy time tea. The taste is also pretty good. I make mine very concentrated<br />with less than 3 ounces of hot  water and I cover the mug top with a plate and wrap a towel around the whole thing<br />and let it sit for as long as I can before I drink it.
2986,2986,2986,2987,5,This tea smells and tastes like Christmas! This has always been my family's favorite tea for children's (and big kid's) tea parties.
2987,2987,2987,2988,5,I began purchasing this tea years ago and looked forward to it each year. For the past two years I was unable to locate it in my local stores so I was elated to find it at Amazon. It tastes like cinnamon and red candy apples to me. I love it!
2988,2988,2988,2989,5,So glad to have found this tea...it's my absolute holiday favorite!  Thanks for the fast shipping too!
2989,2989,2989,2990,4,"****<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings' Sugar Plum Spice is a delightful holiday tea. It contains hibiscus, roasted barley malt, roasted chicory root, rosehips, chamomile flowers, natural plum flavor with other natural flavors, ginger root, roasted carob, and cardamom. It does not contain caffeine, so it's technically an herbal tea.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings has been around a long time, and makes quality teas. All of their teas are free of preservatives and artificial colorings and flavorings, all are certified Kosher and none use irradiated botanicals, which I appreciate. Although they use ""natural flavors"" in their teas, these natural flavors are derived primarily from fruits, spices and herbs, and never contain monosodium glutamate (MSG). They use environmentally conscious packaging and sustainable sourcing. To remove the caffeine from green and black teas, they use a process called ""effervescent decaffeination"" (using carbon dioxide). Celestial Seasonings justifiably takes pride in being a company that makes natural teas.<br /><br />On the package, Celestial Seasonings writes, ""Take a sip of Sugar Plum Spice and journey with us to the Land of the Sweets in Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker. Here you'll find gingerbread houses, trees laden with sugar plums and days filled with sunshine. This is the land of the Sugar Plum Fairy, who is beautiful, gentle and kind. We created this tea to pay tribute to her. Sugar Plum Spice is made with 100% natural herbs and the festive flavors of plum and spice, with just a hint of sweetness."" This tea is slightly sweet and full bodied, tasting just as you would expect from the description. The cardamom and ginger give it a little zing. Each tea bag packs a lot of flavor and I only need to use one at a time.<br /><br />I recommend it, even if it's not a holiday. It's perfect for a cold or wet winter day.<br /><br />****"
2990,2990,2990,2991,5,"It's hard to rate tea. It's very good tea, but tea nonetheless. However, the company that sells this particular tea was very nice to deal with. They shipped the tea very quickly. I'll most likely buy from them again when the need arises."
2991,2991,2991,2992,5,"The fortune cookies were shipped immediately and were packed well, i.e. none arrived broken.  The cookie was delicious and the fortunes were classic chinese (and not the modern version)."
2992,2992,2992,2993,5,My daughter's Kindergarten class celebrated Chinese New Year and we were in charge of providing the fortune cookies.  This company had a prompt delivery and the cookies were a great success.  Her teacher commented on how funny the fortunes were for the kindergartens.
2993,2993,2993,2994,5,"I brought these cookies as a ""dish to pass"" at my family Christmas get together. they were a hit. The cookies were fresh, and unbroken. packaging was well done, and delivery was prompt. my sisters had fun with the fortunes, by adding the phrase, ""while in bed"" after reading each fortune.<br /><br />I will use the Amazon vendor, ""House of Rice"" again."
2994,2994,2994,2995,4,The cookies were kind of stail but other than that it was fast shipping and good packing the cookies weren't broken
2995,2995,2995,2996,4,"My primary reason for ordering, was the picture had shown the cookies as green. I will acknowledge that the ""Important Information"" heading listed a warning that the actual product may be different, compared to what was shown. Aside from the color problem, they were shipped quickly, and properly. Only one or two broken cookies on arrival, but it's no big deal, I eat a few when they come in anyway. I'm not sure what flavor they are, but they are delicious, as per the description. If you're not picky on color, good value."
2996,2996,2996,2997,5,"The cookie is crispy good and flavorful.  The fortunes are thoughtful, not the shallow ones we are seeing lately.(Be patient, even in time an egg will walk)  I received the quantity and quality I ordered."
2997,2997,2997,2998,2,I was expecting these cookies were going to be normal size but i was wrong!  i was planning on dipping them in chocolates but they r not those average size at all! So disappointed! I now have to go out n find the normal size cookies. What a  waste of money. I also needed 50 but 20 of them were broken. They do not put fragile on the box outside.
2998,2998,2998,2999,5,"I ordered these fortune cookies as rewards for my students each time they passed a multiplication test (to go along with the theme ""Fortunately we know our math facts"").  The majority of the cookies arrived still in tact.  I understand that with shipping there are bound to be a few broken cookies.  I am very please with the product and the customer service.  I will definitely be ordering again in the future and will make sure I refer my family and friends to this business."
2999,2999,2999,3000,1,"Reading in earlier reviews that these were genuine chinese fortunes, I served them with a chinese Christmas dinner and was greatly disappointed, as were my guests.  Three sample fortunes are:  ""Life is not a struggle.  It's a wiggle.""  ""Management is doing things right: leadership is doing the right things.""  ""If you're feeling down, try throwing yourself into your work.""  These are not fortunes, they are self-help mini-bites.  A fortune is:  ""Your love of travel will soon be satisfied,"" and it doesn't matter if they are predictive or not.  What matters is that they state a fortune.  ""Beware the dog in the corner house,"" would be fun to get.  ""Life is a wiggle"" is boring.<br />The cookies arrived on schedule, as promised, and in good condition in their individual wrappers.  All of that was as I'd hoped.  But content counts, in fortune cookies especially."
3000,3000,3000,3001,5,"I am very pleased with this product. I almost did not buy them because they looked green on my computer, but when I received them they were the normal tan color that most of them are."
3001,3001,3001,3002,5,This is the second time I have ordered this product.  I was happy enough the first time to place an order again.  Cookies were fine and delivery was very quick. Thank you.
3002,3002,3002,3003,5,Well packed. Few are broken but it is understandable. The cookies are tasty and the notes are interesting. My friends and I really enjoyed it! Thx!
3003,3003,3003,3004,5,"Great Product, fast shipment,the food product tasted great. none of the fortune cookies where opened.  i would buy again from this seller!"
3004,3004,3004,3005,5,"I bought these as a gift for my sister, I was so excited to see that they arrived in great condition. My sister loved them!"
3005,3005,3005,3006,4,These cookies were a big hit at our progressive New Year's Eve dinner.  Everyone enjoyed reading their fortune each time we arrived at another house. They really kept the party moving...
3006,3006,3006,3007,4,"This is a great product, however, you can buy it in a salumeria in Brooklyn, NY for $9.99.  Frank & Sal on 18th Avenue--Brooklyn. And I'm editing my review because amazon assigned me the profile name ""LIAR LIAR."" Animals! I was only stating a fact about what a rip-off the site is.  In the future ,Amazonn please don't call me a liar. That's not nice you stupid thieves."
3007,3007,3007,3008,5,"Bought as a Christmas present. Smells like a milk shake. I might have to try it, might make a coffee drinker out of me!"
3008,3008,3008,3009,5,"Amazing! My roommate brought this home because it was on sale and at first I just gave it a shrug. Within a week I was adding it to every combination of bread, peanut-butter, muffins, sauces, meats I had in my kitchen-- guiltily apologizing to my roommate as I scooped and slathered away. Anything I added it to, even if it seemed strange was immediately transformed into something wonderfully delicious. Even sweetening my tea and coffee with it had me in bliss. Needless to say, the jar was emptied quickly. I went back to the store to try stock up but they were all sold out and I haven't been able to find anything like it since. Please MacKays! bring your deliciousness back, I have a long life ahead of me and I've only just discovered you!!"
3009,3009,3009,3010,4,"I bought this for my sister for christmas...she loved it, but was afraid she'd eat all of it at once, so she took the box to work.  Within 1 hour, it was finished by all her interns!"
3010,3010,3010,3011,3,"This tastes just like Wint-O-Green Life Savers. It's a hard, sweet, crunchy ring, with a minty flavor. That pretty much describes it. It's a crunchy mint shaped like a ring."
3011,3011,3011,3012,3,"This is good popcorn, I have purchased before in Hawaii.  I was happy to see that I can order online.  However, I purchase the 20 pack and they overstuffed the box.  There is no bubble wrap or any type of wrapping around the individual packages before they put it into the box.  They choose a small box that can barely fix all twenty packages.  It is overstuffed to the point that the box is no longer squared, but rounded somewhat.  The postal service does not treat the package with care, so when it arrived, there was a wet stain.  When we opened it, two packages had been damaged, and the butter leaked all over all the other packages.  We had to spend a long time washing all the packages, because they are all greasy.  The greasiness does not wash off easily even with soap.  Now when eating them, some of the other packages of popcorn got water in them because of the washing, they are not air-tight packages.  So when popping them, there are a lot of unpopped kernels.  They should use bigger boxes and wrap it better."
3012,3012,3012,3013,4,"Okay, not like the butter most people would expect, but a very smooth, full and slightly savory vegetal flavor. The first time you take a sip, you might not notice it, but let it sit in your mouth a bit before swallowing and then take another sip. The more you drink it, the more it will become apparent. It is very soothing to the pallet.<br /><br />Jin Xuan Golden Lily Oolong from Summit Tea Company it a good if not great tea, especially for the price and quantity you get. A solid every day drinker. It is not as complex as some that I've had, but that could be due to how long ago it was harvested and a number of other conditions. Depending on how you brew it, a serving of these leaves is good for 4-5 infusions before the flavor wanes, making it an even better value. And even then, the broth is soft and sweet.<br /><br />If you like your Oolongs more on the green side, then you should give it a try. I know I'll be ordering another tin."
3013,3013,3013,3014,5,"I eat these tuna cups (or the salmon cups) almost daily.<br /><br />If you're looking for a nutritious snack, these cups really can't be beat.  If you're a bodybuilder or athlete trying to increase your daily protein intake, these are awesome.  If you're a parent trying to get your kid to eat healthy, getting them to like fish is a great idea.  If you're trying to eat 5-7 meals a day to lose weight, make one of these cups one of your meals, the protein fills you up and makes you feel good.  It also requires a bit of chewing to complete the eating experience.<br /><br />Why eat a nutritionally empty ""100 calorie pack"" of goldfish crackers or potato chips when you could have something like this that has only 80 calories and infinitely more nutritional benefit??<br /><br />I'll eat these alone, straight from the cup, basically anywhere since you don't need to refridgerate and you don't need a can opener.  I'll dump them onto salad, or mix with rice, quinoa, or beans.<br /><br />Here's the nutrition data off the back (for 1 2.7oz cup) at the time of writing:<br /><br />Calories 80 (10 from fat)<br />Total Fat 1g<br />Cholesterol 35mg<br />Sodium 15mg<br />Total Carb 0g<br />Protein 18g<br />Omega-3 EPA/DHA 200mg<br /><br />You really can't beat this for something so portable that requires no preparation or refridgeration.  The package says ""in water"" but there's a little bit of broth in the cup, and if you squeeze this out or just leave it at the bottom of the cup, you probably cut the sodium down to 10mg.<br /><br />I highly recommend these tuna cups and the salmon cups as well.  But, avoid the tuna salad, or the flavored varieties if you are looking to get the maximum nutritional benefit.  Those salads and flavorings just add salt, sugar, carbs."
3014,3014,3014,3015,5,"Although I prefer to get my tuna in the foil packages, what I had ordered appears to no longer be available through Amazon so I tried these and they are handy and pretty goo eating for one.  Toss on a salad, or use on bread or toast to add good quality protein."
3015,3015,3015,3016,5,"Cats are such finicky eaters some times.  My old lady kitty does not like the canned cat foods, but she always went nuts whenever I'd open a can of tuna for myself.  So I gave her some one time.  These Tuna Cups are a great way to keep the tuna fresh enough over a few days, and good for travel.<br /><br />Same items can be purchased at grocery store, but buying in quantity through Amazon saves some $$.  Thank you"
3016,3016,3016,3017,4,"When I'm working, I always carry my own lunch. It's so much better than the food court, and I have much better regulation of my nutrient intake. Finding items having high protein without high fat is the most difficult task. Tuna is excellent and these little Chicken of the Sea White Tuna Cups fill the bill. Put one in the lunch with a few fresh fruit and veggie items and perhaps a few dried fruits and nuts. It's good nutrition, and there's no worry about weight gain. Also, when I'm camping, I like to take a batch of these tuna cups along. In both cases, the cup size just the right for one serving.<br /><br />I had a minor problem with the latest tuna cups, and it might be just a batch problem. My latest tuna was very dry. I almost had to choke it down. And it seemed rather tasteless. I've had these cups in the past and they seemed much better. I have not been satisfied with the present ones. However, I like the product and the serving size and It will not deter me from future purchases.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
3017,3017,3017,3018,5,"I keep a stack of these tuna cups at work, along with lemon juice and teriyaki sauce for variety.  They are low calorie, satisfying, and nutritious.  I'm sold on them-- now buy in bulk and keep on hand all the time!"

3021,3021,3021,3022,4,"I love portable electric corrals.  They are a fantastic option for containing horses while camping, etc.  They are easy to use, give your horse some walking around room,  don't require a level set-up area, are flexible for size/shape, and are  small enough to keep handy in your trailer's tack room.  I much prefer using these to portable panels, high-lining, tying to the trailer, etc.<br /><br />There are many portable corral kits on the market, all very similar with the same kinds of components.  (Except the Zareba EZEE, which is a different animal.)  So I'll give you a component-by-component rundown on the items in this kit.<br /><br />CHARGER - This kit comes with a charger that takes 2 D batteries.  I was leery of this, having had less-than-stellar performance from a 2D charger in the past.  But this one works pretty good, producing a reasonable strength zap with 100 feet of electric tape (with good grounding in damp, solid soil).  If your horse is already accustomed to and respectful of electric fencing, this should be sufficient.  The charger is easy to use, with the fence and ground terminals clearly marked.  The on-off switch is very accessible, and a light and an audible sound tell you when it's on.<br /><br />ELECTRIC TAPE --  This kit is advertised as coming with 200 feet of ½"" tape.  My kit had only 100 feet.  100 feet is enough for one horse.  I don't know where they're coming with up the statement `perfect for containing 4-5 horses for short periods of time'.  No way, not even close, even if I had received the full 200 feet.  Of course, it's easy enough to pick up more electric tape at the farm store.  But beware that the more tape you add on, the less zap you'll get from your charger.  So I'm not sure if the 2D charger would be strong enough with 200 feet of tape.  The tape in this kit comes with a handle pre-installed.  It's a nice handle with a good feel to it, but it doesn't connect nicely to the posts.  I rigged up an extra little tape loop to hook the  handle to.<br /><br />STEP-IN POSTS - These are my favorite kind of step-in posts.  Each post has numerous clips to slide the tape through, so you can set at the right height.  It's very quick and easy to insert and remove the tape from the clips, making set-up and take-down easier.<br /><br />CORNER GUY LINES - This kit comes with some very nice corner guy lines and metal bracing stakes.  Honestly, I'll probably never use them.  With this style of fence, there usually isn't much (if any) tension on the posts, so  I've needed corner guy lines.  Why add to set-up and take-down time?  But if you prefer to use the corner guy lines, I think you'll like the ones in this kit.  They are nice quality adjustable lines, with metal stakes.<br /><br />WIRES, GROUND ROD, ETC -- Of course this kit contains the necessary wires to connect the charger to the fence, and the charger to ground.  The ground rod is a 12"" pointed spike.  Nothing special here.<br /><br />CARRYING BAG - Oh my gosh, A+++ for this carrying bag!  The bag has one long skinny section for the posts, and a separate snap-off zipper tote for the other components.  Within the smaller bag, there  are separate compartments and elastic holders for each piece.  No more jumble of stuff!!!  I love it.  (One quibble - one of the step-in posts had pierced the bag during packing or shipping.  The bag is made of pretty heavy-duty fabric, but not quite heavy-duty enough to stand up to a pointed spike.  And the ends of the bag are not reinforced to avoid this problem.)<br /><br />All in all, this portable fence kit is about as good as any I've seen and would be a reasonable choice for anyone wanting a camping corral.  Just don't expect it to ""contain 4-5 horses "", unless you're rotating those horses in and out one at a time."
3022,3022,3022,3023,3,"Although I think this pen is great...I didn't receive the entire roll of polytape..even after calling customer service...and I think the height of the posts is misleading..hence the 3 stars.  If I wanted to buy a new energizer and more polytape then it would be great to own, as my review below states:<br /><br />Easy one-page instructions and everything fits nicely back inside the bag, without struggling...<br /><br />I needed this portable paddock for my goats because I have a lot of unfenced acreage beyond the barn area.  I was worried about the fence being suitable for goats so I called Customer Service...The rep went to a lot of trouble and checked this for me and said it would work fine for goats as well.  However, several days later, I called back and spoke to another rep and he said that goats needed much higher voltage.  This particular energizer is 3,000 volts and that goats needed 5,000 to 8,000 volts. But he said I could just buy another pulse type energizer and it would work with the tape that I have.  I have older, very mellow goats so the 3,000 volts are working so far.<br /><br />I have different breeds and therefore different heights of goats and one concern was that the clips on the post wouldn't be low enough to the ground for my mixed breed goats but on the post, it has clips all the way down so that the tape can be hung at various heights.  However, even though the post is listed as 4ft high, I measured and they are actually 47 1/8  inches tall and after you push the metal tip into the ground, you are left with a height of 38 inches.  The tape rests at the bottom of the top clip which holds the tape at 35 inches off the ground.  Seems awfully short for horses but I don't know anything about horses either.<br /><br />The instructions are clear and has helpful diagrams, making it all very easy to put together.  I did have problems at the end tying it to the last post.  I had to call Customer Service, and the rep said that you CANNOT unroll the whole spool of polytape if you are hanging it to the last post via the spool, which is per the instructions.  Since I had already unrolled it to the end, I had to tie the end of the polytape to the post or to the empty spool container, which he said was okay, but then it's not easy to untie that knot.<br /><br />In lieu of posts, you can hang the guy wire around trees and then slide the electric tape through the loop.  Guy wires, which are similar to tent stakes give the posts extra stability, but I saw no need for them at all since the clay soil held the posts very well.<br /><br />My ground is hard clay but the fence posts sunk in easily, despite that.  It had rained within the last week though so it may be different depending on the dryness of the soil.  The posts are sturdy, and strong enough to not break with normal use.  I did have gravel in some spots which made me have to relocate a few posts, since the tips would not go past them.<br /><br />There is no mention of the tape being allowed to touch weeds and grass, so I called Customer Service back to find that out. He said that that only a low impedance energizer can be used near grass and this energizer is NOT low impedance.  So, I had to mow where I wanted to put the fence to avoid any problems with grounding.  Not very practical when out on the road.<br /><br />Planning the fence was harder than I imagined because I couldn't make a perfect square and I thought I had measured correctly but still fell short of where I wanted the fence to end.  I then discovered that I was only given 126 feet of polytape rather than the 200 feet.  Doing a trial run of setting the fence up is recommended.<br /><br />I wanted something that was easy.  I'm a small middle-aged female and needed something that wasn't too much trouble so I could move it around without a lot of sweat and tears.  This is perfect for my goat situation if they had just sent me the correct length tape.  It seems too short for horses but I posted the measurements in case it helped someone who has horses."
3023,3023,3023,3024,5,"This product is both effective and convenient. We were able to assemble it and have it working within 30 minutes. It worked great as a ""maternity ward"" for our alpaca millay and her new cria. We were able to give them some private time while not feeling as though they were separated from the herd. I highly recommend this product and will have many uses for it in the future! Please view our pictures we have provided in the customer photo section!!"
3024,3024,3024,3025,4,"This kit pulls together several standard components rather nicely. I am using it for supplemental grazing of horses, particularly to get small areas that are not permanently enclosed as pasture, but that get overgrown and/or delicious.<br /><br />I like it. Setup time, once you figure out the components, is about 15 minutes. It has all the pieces to make a very reasonable temporary electric corral - tape, posts, charger, ground, and gate hook.<br /><br />The 8 step-in posts are fairly standard: they have nice pointy metal stakes at the bottom that make them relatively easy to insert in moist ground. You probably can't get them into rock hard dry ground, but that's not a surprise. There are clips to give you flexibility in the fence height. But - you've probably seen them at the feed store - this kind of post is pretty short and will feel quite short compared to a normal horse fence.<br /><br />The kit is supposed to come with 200' of 1/2"" electric tape. Mine (as a Vine kit) only had 100'. This is enough for one very well behaved horse in a 25x25 square. The tape is not much of a visual barrier, especially with only one strand. This is not a fence I'd trust for a problem horse or for long unattended periods. 200' would be enough for either two strands or to have a 50x50 square and would be a much better value of time spent to grazing time. 50 x 50 is still quite small and the fence is still not substantial. It would be straightforward to add tape, but adding distance also increases the load on the charger.<br /><br />The product description says 4-5 horses. I would not feel safe doing that. Two quiet horses who know each other well and are already familiar with electric fence, maybe three for very brief periods, if you had the 50 x 50 and were nearby or had a secure outer fence. For grazing, three horses would have the area mowed in just a couple of hours.<br /><br />The charger - which uses 2 D batteries - has plenty of zap new. I was pleased by how easy it was to work with. It has its own spike, allowing you to set it up away from the fence.  The connections are long enough that you can put it out of nose range. The grounding nail was easy to set up and pull out.<br /><br />I like that it comes with a simple corner bracing system. You can set it up without the corner braces, depending upon how tight you like your fence and how stiff the ground is. But when you need the braces, you're glad to have the option.<br /><br />The tape comes on a handy small spinning jenny, which is designed to hang on the fence when it is installed. It's a simple thing, and thoughtfully done. It makes it easy to unroll the fence when setting up, and easy to reroll when putting it away. There is no problem doing the whole setup and takedown by yourself.<br /><br />The hook for the gate isn't quite a match for the brackets on the posts. A little bigger hook, or some sort of metal bracket, would be nice, to give a sense of a more secure latch. Still, you're counting on the fence never being touched, so it's not a big problem.<br /><br />The bag for the kit is amazing. Everything fits inside beautifully, with thoughtful pockets - even a special pocket for the instructions. It is easy to carry and extremely organized. I was very impressed to see the thought and effort put into the bag, which makes the kit much easier to use and deal with than just a pile of fence parts. The bag is big enough that there is room for extra items in both the long post compartment and the smaller bag section.<br /><br />This is a very nice and handy kit to have around if you have quiet horses that respect electric fence."
3025,3025,3025,3026,4,"I haven't owned a portable fence for horses until now, but I am impressed and liking this product very much. Upon opening the package I was happy with the portability of the carrying bag, and shocked at how lightweight and compact this system is. It's a great accessory to throw in the trailer when taking the horses out, or just to have around in the event that we need a temporary corral for a couple horses. Once set up, it won't hold more than two of our horses comfortably. I don't think we'd ever try and manage to get 4 inside like the product advertises!<br /><br />The instructions were surprisingly simple and it set up easily between myself and my husband working on it. I can see how this would be great to have for other animals as well (such as alpacas), but we only have need for it with the horses and have had success in containing them.  The step in posts are fantastically designed, the overall design makes the fence very versatile, setting up easily pretty much anywhere your horse an go.<br /><br />We're very happy with it's design and portability and will get a lot of good use out of this system, I think!"
3026,3026,3026,3027,5,"I am always impressed when someone tries to solve an old problem in a new way. And I have never been happy hobbling my horse - I'd rather she could escape from a dangerous situation, and something unpredictable is far more likely to happen on the trail than at home. Sooo - here we have this device that is compact and weighs only 15 pounds, thus is easy to pack for trail rides. And since it operates on easily-obtainable D cells, no problem being ""off the grid"".<br /><br />The Fi-Shock HC-100 Portable Paddock showed up in a nice durable red Cordura nylon case. The long part contains eight molded, reinforced plastic stakes with foot push tabs to make it easy to get the metal spikes at the bottom, into the ground. Their working height seems to be just about 3 feet. Multiple slots allow a variety of configurations in set-up.<br /><br />A smaller bag attaches to the pole bag with snaps. It contains 100' of conductive tape on a reel (no, I don't know why the product description says 200'), the transformer of nicely molded, durable-looking green plastic, a transformer stand to be tamped into the ground, a shoulder strap, and two D cell batteries which I promptly put in a safer place so they couldn't accidentally contact conductive material and discharge.<br /><br />This proved easy enough to set up in an area that is clear of tall brush that could cause trouble when contacting the live tape. Properly set up, the paddock's batteries did not drain. Of course I carried extras. I also chose to guy the corners which I am used to with tents. Of course I had to bring extra rope and tent stakes for that purpose. No problem.<br /><br />This worked... for ONE not-huge horse who is trained to electric fences, so she doesn't challenge them. Sure, any beast of her size could easily break out, but I'd want her to if in danger. No, I can't see how the stated 4 or 5 horses could be contained in this enclosure. But this a viable solution on the trail, for my mare."
3027,3027,3027,3028,5,"Got this to take along on backpacking trips with the horses.  It works fine for that purpose, the size is perfect and worked like a charm.  The two horses didn't attempt a getaway, at least.<br /><br />Easy to put up and easy to take down, along with the portability makes this a camping winner!"
3028,3028,3028,3029,5,"I don't have horses, so I am not using this in the traditional way.<br /><br />Our backyard is being redone and all the fences are down.  With a pool there, though covered, I was concerned about the wanderers etc. So this came in handy and it was so easy to set up."
3029,3029,3029,3030,4,This is a great temporary fence for 1 or 2 horses. It is kinda unwieldy and you may need a little help setting it up if you are a smallish person but it works great after setup.
3030,3030,3030,3031,5,"I bought this color for a cake replica of the Stanley Cup that I made.  I was using this color for the very first time and I have to say that it was perfect!  I was afraid that the silver would be too dark or matte, but it had a sheen and was exactly what I was hoping for."
3031,3031,3031,3032,5,"This is the first time I have found a US produced truffle oil that actually contains real truffle. A lot of other ""truffle oils"" just have ""truffle aroma"" (whatever that is) and a lot of chemicals that sound less than pleasant. You can definitely taste the difference as well."
3032,3032,3032,3033,5,These cookies are amazing. They taste as good as if not better than the original brands. I only wish local stores would catch on and carry this cookie.
3033,3033,3033,3034,5,"These cookies are ridiculous.  They are just as delectable as ... well... any popular chocolate-sandwich-with-cream-center-cookie you can think of :)  When you compare them, they are slightly larger in serving size (2g bigger), and still they have about 10 fewer calories, the same fat, sugar, and carb content, but 25% less saturated fat, three times the fiber, and are MUCH more nutritious (loads of vitamins, minerals, etc). Plus, you don't HAVE to eat 3 cookies, you can just have one or two (good luck).  Everyone who has come to my house has asked to try one, and they went crazy for them.  If you are craving something sweet after a meal and still want to put good things into your body, you will absolutely love these cookies. Delicious to munch and no weird after-taste whatsoever (unlike the WhoNu chocolate chip cookies).  Just sweet, chocolatey, Oreo-esque yumminess.<br /><br />I will say, though, that I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why they're so expensive on Amazon. Maybe because they're not in every grocery store yet, so, when combined with shipping, Amazon can get away with charging a little more?  Who knows. I know I bought them here for convenience, and I'm so glad I got three boxes.  I know you can find them in ShopRite or WalMart for around $3.<br /><br />Wherever you end up getting them, enjoy!"
3034,3034,3034,3035,5,"These chocolate sandwich creme cookies by WhoNu? are every bit as delicious as similar brands but they are healthier for you. True, they have almost the same sugar, fat and carb amounts of the best-known name brand of these cookies; but as others have noted they also give you fiber with noticeably more vitamins and minerals than that other brand. This is a plus!<br /><br />They're really good as a snack and it's hard to stop at the serving size of just three cookies; but I guess I'm allowed an occasional guilty pleasure! As I write this they are a bit too expensive on this website; try looking for these cookies elsewhere unless you want the convenience of having them shipped to your door.<br /><br />Overall, these awesome chocolate sandwich creme cookies by WhoNu? are the best! I definitely recommend them as an excellent, healthier alternative to the major name brand of this type of cookie.<br /><br />I love `em! Enjoy!"
3035,3035,3035,3036,5,"I bought these locally, not from amazon. I'm in Arizona and they are sold in Albertsons and Bashas stores. They are absolutely delicious and taste just like other cookies. I bought all four of the ""flavors"" to test them out. The only one I didn't like was the chewy chocolate chip. All others though are wonderful. I count calories and try to eat healthy, but I do indulge with treats sometimes. This is the perfect treat since it has all the vitamins and fiber! I will never eat a regular cookie again. What's the point when you can actually get nutrition from tasty cookies!?"
3036,3036,3036,3037,2,"I love these cookies, they taste exactly like Oreos. But unfortunately, every time I eat them (2 cookies at a time)I get horrible headaches and migraines (which I don't get from real Oreos) Its obviously caused by some of the 'nutritious' ingredients. Another thumbs down---they include vitamin K which should not be eaten by anyone on blood thinners, or for anyone middle-aged or older who overindulges in these cookies be warned---vitamin K can cause blood clots.<br />HEADACHE & MIGRAINE SUFFERERS BEWARE of these cookies!"
3037,3037,3037,3038,3,"I really liked these cookies when they first came out.  But then I got a little tired of them.  They have a bit of a gritty texture, and they don't taste the way you hope they will when thinking of an Oreo.  They are worth eating if you have a bad craving, but I can't eat more than one or two.  The different taste gets to me.  There may be an ingredient in them that doesn't agree with me.  They contain vegetable oils, just like Oreos do.  Palm oil is in practically everything these days because it is cheap for companies to use.  When I eat it, it leaves a thick, greasy film in my mouth and throat.  Store-made cake frostings, cookies, cupcakes...anything that has it leaves that feeling, and I don't like it at all.  Some are worse than others, making it hard to swallow.  This happened when I ate a double-stuf chocolate WhoNu cookie.  Palm oil is listed as an ingredient.  I stopped buying them and the regular chocolate.  I only get the vanilla version.  They contain palm oil as well, but I'm guessing it is less because they don't bother me.  I like them much better.  It's weird because I like chocolate sandwich cookies better than vanilla ones in general.  But with Whonu, the vanilla wins for me.<br /><br />Yesterday I had a craving for a chocolate sandwich cookie, and I bought Oreos.  Even Oreos don't taste as good as they used to.  I guess since the trans fat change in products.  The WhoNu cookies have the extra vitamins and nutrients, and less sodium.  But the Oreos have a better flavor.  The difference in fat content doesn't seem to be very different.  Actually, the difference in sodium doesn't seem very significant, either.  I decided I'd rather eat a few Oreos than a few of these.  It's something you have to decide for yourself when comparing the pros and cons."
3038,3038,3038,3039,5,"This review is based on taste only, not nutritional value or any of the other qualities or selling points of these cookies.  I wrote three sort of similar reviews for this brand of cookies.  This review is for those who are looking for a cookie because they want a cookie, not vitamins or fiber or whatever.  I bought them because I have a sweet tooth and wanted some cookies and these were on sale plus I had a coupon.  I purchased the crispy cookies, the vanilla sandwich cookies and the chocolate sandwich cookies.  I thought they were all very good and would not hesitate to buy them again. I found these cookies to taste very good, very similar to an oreo except that the cookie part was a little thinner and crispier than an Oreo.  Oreos might taste a wee bit better but then they're Oreos, come on.  A cool fact I found out when I was looking up ingredients for Whonu Chocolate Sandwich cookies and Oreos, the first ingredient in regular Oreos is sugar and in these cookies and most other sandwich cookies I think it is flour.  I found that interesting for some reason.  Anyway, out of the three flavors I tried this was my least favorite but only because I like vanilla ALOT, these are still great tasting chocolate sandwich cookies!"
3039,3039,3039,3040,4,"these are grossly overpriced.  It is a package of three boxes but when you take into account that they are a dollar of two per box than they should be, you then have to pay for shipping.  Sorry, I would skip them.  My local grocery store carries them and a box is anywhere from 2.98 to 3.49 each.  Although these are healthier than some other cookies, you still have to watch the fat, sugar and salt contents.  Whole foods are much better for you but in a moment or two of indulging, these fit the bill.  Just the price on this site is ridiculous!  Ask your grocer to start carrying them."
3040,3040,3040,3041,1,"We purchased this product and were greatly disappointed.  The product did not have the texture or the taste that it should have.  We contacted customer service and when they discovered that we were complaining, they suddenly could not understand us and said customer service would contact us.  We never got a call back and could not get in touch with them again.  Very expensive and no quality.  Stay away from this company.  We lived in Spain for years and know what this product should taste like and this was not what it should have tasted like."
3041,3041,3041,3042,5,"i purchased Cafe Excellence Crazy Caramel, Flavored Whole Bean<br />coffee it has a very good flavor and would buy again and the price was great"
3042,3042,3042,3043,5,"Great, Fresh coffee beans. Gave as a christmas gift. We all had some of it and loved it. The smell was great and the flavour was awsome."
3043,3043,3043,3044,5,This gum is my absolute favorite. By purchasing on amazon I can get the savings of large quanities at a very good price. I highly recommend to all gum chewers. Plus as you enjoy the peppermint flavor and freshing of breath you are whitening your teeth all at the same time.
3044,3044,3044,3045,5,"Took me years to find the ultimate chewing gum, but when I found Wrigley's Orbit White peppermint the search ended. I've been chewing this gum for many years now, I occasionally try something else, but nothing ever wins. The peppermint in this gum can wipe out the worst of bad breath, and toward the end of its chewable life, it doesn't start to taste awful or give you worse breath as many gums will do; it simply loses its flavor.<br /><br />Only drawbacks. I usually chew 2 pieces at a time, so they are a bit small and #2 they just changed the packaging. It used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket, inside suit jacket pocket etc, now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so it's bulky. Not sure why they had to change; probably to do with retail stores layout. This won't prevent me from buying it, but it's really annoying. Wrigley; just never change the flavor!"
3045,3045,3045,3046,5,"I bought these for my girlfriend who just happens to live in California, and she loved them. The chocolates came fresh and the packaging was just beautiful.<br /><br />Hand-written card, her name was hand-written on the front of the card, and extra care was taken in the whole process. I will definitely buy again from Choclatique.<br /><br />If I could rate higher, I would. I was sent a $15 refund for the shipping because my girlfriend lived nearby. I've never had such an honest company before, that was pretty cool!"
3046,3046,3046,3047,5,Got these luscious wine chocolates to use as part of my stocking stuffers.  They were yummy and a big hit with everyone.  Would definitely buy again.
3047,3047,3047,3048,5,"I was starting to think that Snyder and I just didn't share the same idea about what's good in snack flavors. I have tried several of their other pretzel pieces flavors (Buffalo Wing and Honey Mustard) and was very disappointed. I have to say, that these Cheddar Cheese flavor pieces are not just good, but spectacularly good! They have a very rich, buttery cheese flavor with pleasant yeasty aftertaste. These are totally addictive. It's very easy to munch through the entire large bag in one setting."
3048,3048,3048,3049,5,"Very tasty cheese flavor. Because of crunch and small pieces (of mixed size), it goes a long way without adding too many calories. A good buy. Walt B., Apple Valley"
3049,3049,3049,3050,5,"My husband is a pretzel lover and has become addicted to these. I don't see the draw, being firmly in the potato chip camp myself, but to each his own. Our local stores only stock these occasionally, so he has tried all the other flavors, and while he does like the jalapeno, they don't like him back. It's nice to be able to buy them here and not have to run all over town looking for them."
3050,3050,3050,3051,5,My daughter loves these snacks and can't get them in China where she is working now so I ordered them for her. Very satisfied and she was very appreciative.
3051,3051,3051,3052,5,"When we get very busy in our home, I like this sausage a lot for quick meal options. The flavor is a bit sweet, and works well with lots of types of vegetables. Usually I'll slice it lengthwise and saute it until done, then add sweet potatoes,potatoes and onions to the pan to make up a skillet. With a bit of cheese on top it's all the food groups in a one pan meal that my family enjoys. Mac and cheese with peas and sausage mixed in is another option that my daughter is crazy for. For that I cut the sausage into coins and cook it up, then make up the homemade mac and cheese as usual, add frozen peas and the sausage and finish cooking. The sweetness of the sausage with the salty of the cheese is good and it's just so easy to make."
3052,3052,3052,3053,5,"I use these to keep my finicky toddler's protein levels up. What's great, is that they're delicious just about any way you can imagine cooking a sausage!<br /><br />A favorite Recipe: Sautee one large onion, about a tablespoon each dried basil and oregano, and some salt and pepper in about 2T of butter. Add sausage, that's been cut into coins, and russet potatoes cut into 1/4"" thick rounds. Cover all with chicken stock and simmer until potatoes are soft but not dissolved. Throw in a few handfuls of pre-washed baby spinach (I usually use about a half a pound, and frozen would work fine, just put it in a minute earlier). Stir until the spinach is cooked, and then serve! Enjoy!"
3053,3053,3053,3054,5,"Having recently purchased a single cup coffee maker, we discovered Green Mountain and their delicious varieties of coffee.  I love the Island Coconut flavor so much it is now a staple in our household with all other flavors taking a 2nd seat.  The roast of the coffee is wonderful and really lets the coconut shine through.  Try it with a little Chocolate Coffee Mate Creamer and you'll swear you were having a decadent treat straight from the Islands...  YUM!!!"
3054,3054,3054,3055,5,"The Best smooth tasting new coffee we have had since we have been to the Islands,all good as ice coffee."
3055,3055,3055,3056,5,"If you're looking for a very light, refreshing coffee, this one is for you.  Nice Coconut flavor without any bitterness.  May be too light for some people."
3056,3056,3056,3057,3,"I was really looking forward to the Dulce de Leche Cheerios.  The Honey Nut flavor has been my favorite since they came out and the thought of caramel was quite appealing.<br /><br />The first few spoonfuls seemed quite yummy.  But the more I ate, the less I enjoyed it.  The caramel flavor seemed a bit off to me or maybe it was that these are more corn than oat so the flavor was different from that as well.  (Oats are the third ingredient after corn and sugar; I thought Cheerios were always oat cereals.) All things considered (especially price), I'll stick with Honey Nut.<br /><br />They tasted pretty good just plain from the box so I think I'll save them for when I want a slightly sweet snack but not too sugary.  I'll pour out a handful and eat them like a toddler!<br /><br />I expected these to be more sugary than the Honey Nut but these have 6 grams of sugar per serving compared to 9 grams for the Honey Nut.  But they have the same total carbohydrates, 22 grams per serving, so there isn't much difference in how it affects your body.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I won't buy them again."
3057,3057,3057,3058,5,"I became addicted to eating these the first time I tasted them which was years ago. Once you eat one, you just can't stop until they're gone. They aren't too sweet and make the perfect snack. I love these things!!!"
3058,3058,3058,3059,5,"My synagogue's Passover Care Package had some of these candies in it, and WOW are they good!  Americans have little exposure to sesame seeds except atop a burger bun.  Time to taste these nutty little wonders!  Individually wrapped to keep them fresh and slow you down (grins).  Better than peanut brittle any day!  And these are kosher for passover!"
3059,3059,3059,3060,1,"I've had many types of pepper jelly, and this is by far the worst ever. The price is high, and the taste is not good. The shipping was outrageous. More costly than the green pepper jelly. Don't waste you money."
3060,3060,3060,3061,5,This is amongst the best Karachi Halwa I have eaten. Not rubbery or super chewy like a lot of the other ones...just perfect.. individually wrapped pieces in the box.
3061,3061,3061,3062,5,"I'm allergic to wheat so i have few options for pasta.  Corn pasta has a grainy texture that i don't care for, quinoa pasta is the same and rice pasta has a tendency to stick together.  This Orgran pasta is PERFECT.  I think i even overcooked it a bit and it still held it's shape(s) (farm animals!) and it was delicious.  My husband also agreed that it was really good.  The calorie count seems a little lower than other pastas as well.  i will continue to order this product as long as Amazon carries it!  It's GRRRRRRRREAT!"
3062,3062,3062,3063,5,My celiac daughter loves the gluten free animal pasta.  It is by far her favorite.  We make macaroni and cheese with it and she asks for it several times a week and takes the leftovers to school for lunch the next day.  She loves that the pasta is animal shapes and different colors and the horse is her favorite.  A must have.
3063,3063,3063,3064,5,"I ordered this pasta because I thought my children would love the animal shapes. Since I am the only GlutenFree in our home, I try to find FUN things for the entire family instead of making 2 separate meals. When I served this at dinner the other night, my husband's expression said it all! He followed his surprised look with ""Now This is Pasta!"" We could not believe how good this pasta was. We are now hooked! I can not wait to try some more of the OrgraN products."
3064,3064,3064,3065,5,"I have to eat gluten free, but my family doesn't.  This is the only pasta so far that my kids can't see a real difference.  They like it a lot.  This is one I fix when I don't have time or energy to fix separate things for them and myself.  Because it tastes yummy for all of us."
3065,3065,3065,3066,3,"These brownies bake up very nicely.  I would call their consistency ""cake like"".  However my husband called them Healthy Brownies.  He said he could taste the flax seed.  I tend to agree.  In my opinion, if I'm going to eat chocolate, I don't want it to have that ""healthy"" taste.  On the other hand I love the Blueberry Muffins that Hodgson Mill makes."
3066,3066,3066,3067,5,"I have a sweet tooth and so does my three year old son. This is a great after dinner dessert that I feel good about giving him and myself. They ARE healthy and you CAN taste the flax seed in them, but I have really grown to love that healthy taste and texture. I even come to crave it now. They are satisfying and filling and my whole family loves them. I buy them in bulk and love other Hodgson Mill products as well.<br /><br />  If you eat nothing but white flour products and can't get used to or absolutly hate whole grains and their taste and texture, then this is not the product for you. If you are the family that tries to make healthy choices and have healthier alternitives then this is a wonderful product. I still love to have my junk food (Pillsbury and Hershey's here I come!!!) I just try to have it only on very special occasions. The rest of the time I choose to nurish my body and satisfy my taste buds. That is when I reach for this brownie mix.<br /><br />  My only complaint is that they don't taste too great after only a couple days. So make up a batch, eat em' up quick (within 2 days) and you will be smiling!"
3067,3067,3067,3068,5,"Good, but I add a cup of whole wheat flour and a tsp. of baking powder along with a couple of TBSP. of Cocoa powder because I like brownies a little higher and more cake like.  They come yummy and with the added flour, they're not too sweet."
3068,3068,3068,3069,5,"My kids love brownies, but I could no longer by the regular brands in the grocery store with a good conscious.  I still wanted the convenience of a mix, though.  These fit the bill.  They first time I made them, they thought they tasted ""funny"" because they were so used to the processed crap.  Now they eat them up and have gotten used to the flax taste.  I think they are YUMMY!<br />These are in no way low-calorie or low-fat though.  Instructions call for a lot of oil, eggs, and butter (you can use Earth Balance and egg replacer if you're vegan).  Flax seeds also have a good amount of fat (although the healthy kind). I've made them with olive oil before and they were just as good.  I've also added extra organic cocoa powder to make them extra chocolatey, but they really don't need it.  I love the chewy texture of the flax seeds.  There are very few ingredients, I could probably make the same brownies homemade, but it would be a pain to have to grind the flax seeds, etc.  These are easy and yummy.  Even though they are not necessarily ""healthy"" from a calorie and fat standpoint, I can feel good about giving my kids treats that aren't loaded with processed crap."
3069,3069,3069,3070,5,"Add walnuts to this healthful Brownie and perhaps a light iceing.  Do not overback or it will be very dry.  Lots of good stuff in this Brownie,  but the flax taste is a little strong.  I really feel no guilt when having a Brownie snack for me or my kids."
3070,3070,3070,3071,5,"I really like this brownie mix.  Unfortunately my local grocer has stopped carrying them - hence buying them from Amazon!!  They are easy to prepare and bake up very nicely.  Very moist and I think it has just the right amount of chocolate flavor.  Yes, they are healthy and are more dense than traditional brownies - but they fill my chocolate craving better and I really feel like I have eaten dessert - not just some fluff from a box.  [...]"
3071,3071,3071,3072,5,"I made these according to package directions, and added 1 cup of mini chocolate chips, and they were awesome!  They took longer to cook than the box says, maybe that's because of the chocolate chips.  Either way, they were great and I'll definitely make them again."
3072,3072,3072,3073,4,"For quite a while, before Amazon starting retailing food items, it was nearly impossible to locate this healthy underground-favorite brownie mix. There were blogs and food sites bemoaning how hard it was to locate.  So when we saw it on Amazon we ordered a case and baked up batches for all our friends and family. The concensus was: it tastes healthier but, never the less, quite good. It is far better when prepared with at least a cup of mini-chocolate chips. (Not regular chips which can sink to the bottom.) We buy good quality Belgian chocolate minichips. This mix is a great alternative if you want less guilt in your guilty pleasures."
3073,3073,3073,3074,5,"Of course they don't taste quite as good as ""regular"" brownies but hello?  That's because they're healthy!  And that being said, they are FANTASTIC!  Why eat crap when there are such good alternatives!?"
3074,3074,3074,3075,5,If your not into healthy and into flax seed DO NOT buy these.  They are healthy and they taste like it!  I love them...they are very good.  My husband loved them too.  It's all a matter of taste.  If you're looking for a Dunkan Hines brownie these are not it.
3075,3075,3075,3076,2,"i'm a big fan of hodgson mill products (we love their bread mixes, i use their pancake mixes.) i'm not afraid of whole grains  (i mill my own grains, wheat, kamut, rye, barley) and i even put milled flax seed in my (home made) yogurt. I've been a baker for 35 years and love to try new recipes.<br /><br />i had high expectations for this product but was very disappointed by the results: the box calls for too much fat and the baked brownies have a distinctly oily feel in the mouth.  I can enjoy the grittiness and the chocolate flavor is fine but i would caution buyers against the results if following the instructions on the box<br /><br />one of the problems is that the coarse texture of the mix does not allow the fat to be absorbed well.<br /><br />i will go back to making whole wheat brownies from scratch.  a little bit of time required... a little less convenient but brownies being a treat (and comfort food), the texture should be right :)"
3076,3076,3076,3077,4,We like this brownie mix and I usually use the low fat recipe on it. I also add chocolate chips or something else to it otherwise it ends up a little bit dry.<br /><br />We still buy this by the case.
3077,3077,3077,3078,4,"These brownies are good, but the flax seed texture can be a real turn-off.  To minimize it, I added a little whole wheat flour, splenda and cocoa - BIG improvement and my guests never complained (like they did the first time I made the brownies!)."
3078,3078,3078,3079,3,"I like that this item has flax seed in it but the whole wheat flower makes it very grainy.  It is also very oily even after you cook it.  If you do not mind gritty brownies then get this product.  Also, they are not very chocolately so I added chocolate chips to the recepie.  It makes it have more fat and calories but they taste better this way."
3079,3079,3079,3080,5,You CAN taste the flaxseed in these whole-wheat muffins and it's a great taste.  Good chocolate flavor and texture.  I add chopped walnuts.
3080,3080,3080,3081,5,"If you are used to eating flaxseed, then this is the brownie for you.  Hodgson Mill brownies are super easy to make, and taste great.  Since I like dark chocolate, I usually add a little more cocoa."
3081,3081,3081,3082,3,"I was hoping for a health substitute for white flour brownies.  It's OK, but not what I would serve to company.  I substitute canola oil for the butter or margarine and that may have been the problem.  Of course, I wound up eating them all anyway."
3082,3082,3082,3083,1,"first off, i love whole wheat products, and flax seed so i hope we just got a bad batch (and no it wasn't expired, i checked the date) but my mom and i just had some of these and we're not fans. they had an oddly fishy/grassy taste to it kind of like you might get with rancid flax oil tablets. O_o"
3083,3083,3083,3084,5,"I received all the ingredients in a timely manner. All the ingredients were nicely packed and remained fresh through the shipping stages. It was more than I needed for the meal I was making, so I had plenty of left over ingredients."
3084,3084,3084,3085,5,The produce was extremely fresh.  I made a delicious Thai soup with the items and had plenty to spare.
3085,3085,3085,3086,5,"Exceptionally fresh quality and quantity and shipped much faster than expected. I was able to make great Tom Yum soup.  Thank you!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P151AI"">Fresh Thai Produce Kit</a>"
3086,3086,3086,3087,5,I first tried this tea at at French restaurant that had ran out of the usual black tea with mint. To my surprise this tea beats any tea (without milk).. no sugar needed. It is naturally sweetened!
3087,3087,3087,3088,5,Love this hot chocolate--nice creamy flavor.  The price is good and I love the single packs.  This is not a flavor available to me locally.
3088,3088,3088,3089,5,I love the chamomile tea. Its sweet and mild. Its excellent for a bed time tea.
3089,3089,3089,3090,5,With all herbal treatments it is important to understand that the earlier in ilness one will start using them the better.<br />I love to use herbal teas and find them very effective when used properly.
3090,3090,3090,3091,5,"I don't know which herb is so tasty in here.. but it's a great combination.  I don't like licorice flavors, and this tea is great because I can reap the great benefits of licorice root, without tasting it!<br /><br />It really does help my symptoms, and drinking it for prevention has worked great for me as well.  And you cannot beat the shipping price (free with super saver shipping) with Amazon."
3091,3091,3091,3092,5,"I always start my son on this tea when he starts a cold. He actually now asks for it. I prepare it and put it in a thermo for him to drink during the day at school. It works wonders when he starts drinking it right away when the symptoms are obvious. The throat does heal from this tea. If he starts it after the illness has taken full course, it still helps it sooth it a lot. My son loves it and I have recommended to other friends who now buy it all the time. Great effective results!!!"
3092,3092,3092,3093,5,"We just got our first order a few days ago, and my 10 month old daughter loves them! They're just like the Gerber mini veggies, but much cheaper. Although they still cost a good bit, having a nutrient filled, easy to take anywhere travel snack is well worth it. My daughter doesn't have any teeth yet, and she hasn't had any problems eating them. They're light and fluffy, yet full of flavor."
3093,3093,3093,3094,5,"I don't know why my toddler is so crazy about these, but he is.  He was snacking on so many cheerios every day that I was desperate to find something else that he would like but wouldn't require refrigeration, and this saved the day.  I feel good about feeding him healthier snacks and he is positively in love with these!"
3094,3094,3094,3095,5,"My dog has heart failure and can't have the standard dog treats because of the salt. These are perfect- she likes to ""hunt"" for her snacks, and these are perfect to toss out to her, and let her go nuts.  She really likes them :)"
3095,3095,3095,3096,1,"I've been buying these for nearly 5 years and this is the fiirst time that my son has refused to eat them. They are darker green than usual, which was not a problem, but the texture was chewier and the flavor wasn't as good. This is a problem since it's the only vegetable my son eats and he has severe feeding issues. The taste & texture were so different he was gagging. Not pleased with the change."
3096,3096,3096,3097,5,These are a delicious guilt free snack that I always have handy. They are so convenient and last a long time. I also get the corn and mixed veggies which are also wonderful. You can get them at Whole Foods but not at this price.
3097,3097,3097,3098,5,"We first tried this because our toddler went through a picky-eater phase. She loved these! They are crunchy and small enough for her to pick up. I love them because they are organic and a veggie that she actually asks for. I mainly give them to her right out the package but I've also mixed them into scrambled eggs, which she really likes too."
3098,3098,3098,3099,5,"These taste great and have a great texture.<br /><br />Our 2-year-old has little interest in eating fresh vegetables, but she loves these.  She actually prefers these over goldfish crackers or other products of dubious nutritional value!  To me, that fact is worth the expense -- it is worth the cost to get her to eat vegetables."
3099,3099,3099,3100,5,We love this brand of freeze dried fruit and veggies.  They make it easy to have healthy on the go snacks for our 2 year old!
3100,3100,3100,3101,4,"My 22-month old daughter has loved these ever since she started chewing her food.  They are tasty, healthy, and have zero additives.  On the downside, every few handfuls there is a pea that is as hard as a freaking ROCK.  I can barely crunch into it with my adult teeth, so I worry about what would happen if she really bites down on them with her baby teeth.  That being said, it's been months and nothing bad has happened...and it hasn't worried me enough to stop feeding her the peas, it's just something that I feel should be noted to those considering purchasing this otherwise excellent product."
3101,3101,3101,3102,5,Feel like a protein boost?  Got the nibbles?  Don't want to succumb to potato chips?  Here's a great alternative!  Just don't let your toddler try to open the package or your peas will be all over the floor making  for an expensive snack for the dog and a grumpy mommy.
3102,3102,3102,3103,3,"I like the dried peas from Just tomatoes and I also like their Just Corn.  They are way too expensive though.  They are really handy because I don't use frozen or canned foods because I follow an Ayurvedic diet which prohibits them.  When I can not find fresh peas I have to use these.  I will probably have to do without as I can't afford these, too bad."
3103,3103,3103,3104,1,"Even though this item is listed under the Gluten free category, it is not.  The ingredients state that it contains wheat protein.  Do not order this if you need GF food.  Bad reviewing by Amazon!"
3104,3104,3104,3105,5,"I bought this for Christmas and gave a few away as gifts.  You get a bunch of boxes, but if you love bacon, there are a lot of uses for it!  I've made sour cream chip dip, cheese balls, added to mashed potatoes and mac & cheese, sprinkled on baked potatoes in place of bacon bits.  If you can dream it you can do it.<br /><br />The bacon flavor is not over powering, it is a subtle delicious taste.  I love Davis & Davis products and will be trying different varieties for sure."
3105,3105,3105,3106,5,Dogs love this product but it ends up too crumbly and hard to give to the dogs.  But it is really a great product.
3106,3106,3106,3107,5,"For serious goat cheese lovers, this is a step up from the French goat cheese that you can buy at the grocery store. I had never had smoked goat cheese before and this was a revelation: the creamy, smooth, a little sour taste went fabulously well with the smoke flavor. I used it sprinkled over a tomato, bean and romaine salad and also spread on toast points topped with an apple-zucchini relish from the 101 cookbooks blog. Outstanding artisan cheese that I look forward to enjoying again."
3107,3107,3107,3108,5,If you like goat cheese and smoked cheeses you will love this.  It has a very smokey creamy flavor.  Try it spread on crackers with a little black truffle oil.
3108,3108,3108,3109,5,"I have a history of mild/moderate acid reflux, so I take it easy with coffee. I was delighted to discover Puroast, which is a reduced acid coffee that is reasonably priced. The French Roast flavor is utterly delicious. It tastes like I went to a coffee house for fancy coffee, but it's just brewed in my drip coffee pot in my kitchen. (Even more convenient if my husband does it for me!) Try it - you won't be disappointed. The cinnamon flavor is also very, very good."
3109,3109,3109,3110,5,"I haven't been able to drink coffee for over 5 years due to gastritis and indigestion with even a few drops of the stuff.  Coffee is my favorite and reaching desperation I gave Puroast a try.  This stuff is a miracle- not only am I symptom-free, it is good coffee.  I am so thankful to be able to have coffee back in my life!"
3110,3110,3110,3111,5,"I was delighted to discover this rich-tasting coffee, which has half the acid of regular brands. I served it to a guest with an acid reflux problem and she not only enjoyed the cuppa, she reported that she felt fine afterwards. This is a great coffee to have in your pantry for finick-y guests or to stock for discerning coffee-drinkers who find the taste of Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts simply too harsh. Also loved the charming packaging."
3111,3111,3111,3112,4,"This coffee is a great alternative for someone who has acid reflux and ulcer problems.  The low acid allows me to still have my caffine for the day.  Maybe not as smooth tasting as my usual blend, but I'm so thankful for it.  Really close in taste."
3112,3112,3112,3113,5,"I've been using this ""low acid"" coffee for a few weeks now and along with the taste, I enjoy not having an ""acid stomach"", especially the ""morning after"".  To me, there is no difference in taste between it and regular coffee.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars."
3113,3113,3113,3114,5,I decided to try puroast over a year ago because of stomach problems and mouth swelling.  Puroast did the trick!  Plus it tastes great!  Couldn't be happier with it (although I wish they would bring the organic decaf back!)
3114,3114,3114,3115,5,"My wife and I tried this product a few days ago. We were not disappointed. The coffee had a good flavor, and the low acid was a nice added benefit."
3115,3115,3115,3116,3,"I struggle between giving this 3 or 4, even 5 stars - because I am just thankful for the substitute, as I have a condition that I need low acid coffee for. However, I DO have to admit, it tastes like burnt coffee (as someone else put it) and it is no Peets or Starbucks. The taste, and the flavor it leaves in your mouth after you are done, is something I don't think I will ever get used to.<br /><br />Update: I had my father in law up. Would like to say that if you are one, like he is, that puts mounds of creamer and sugar in your coffee...apparently you will not notice a difference in taste from this brand to another. Hope that helps!"
3116,3116,3116,3117,3,If you don't want to give up the taste of coffee but can't handle the acid try this coffee. Does not taste like gourmet coffee but it does not produce acid side effects.
3117,3117,3117,3118,3,"I love, love, love dark roasted coffee and don't like a acid taste so I thought this would be great,<br /><br />I was pleased with the 'no acid taste,"" but...I had to use twice as much to get the same flavor I usually like. That wouldn't be a big deal- but it meant I went through the coffee faster than I should have and that can get expensive.<br /><br />This blend was ground very finely so would not be good with a french press. I was able to use it with a pour over."
3118,3118,3118,3119,2,"A short while ago, my doctor looked me in the eye and said, ""Buddy, you got acid reflux real bad.""  (My dentist said the same - only he was able to make his announcement a bit more colorful by showing `worst case scenario' pictures of teeth on battery acid. He put me off coffee for a week.)  So, with that double-whammy in mind, I've lately been trying to cut back on acidic foods.  Hence my decision to go the low-acid coffee route.<br /><br />And like the headline says, this coffee is a good news bad news situation.<br /><br />First, the good news: Puroast Coffee does in fact appear to be legitimately low-acid.  I've noticed a distinct reduction in acid reflux activity after drinking it.<br /><br />Now, the bad news: this coffee is kinda bad.  I should note, this isn't the opinion of a coffee snob:  while I like a good cup of Peet's Coffee as much as the next guy, I'm a-okay with a batch of Folger's or the basic house brand of whatever chain store I happen to be shopping in.  I'm usually just looking for a pleasant kick start in the morning at a price that isn't highway robbery.<br /><br />Alas, for all of its low acidity (and decent price), this coffee ain't that pleasant kick start.  There's an unpleasant flavor to it that is rather hard to describe - other than to say that Puroast doesn't really taste like French Roast coffee.  Even doctored up with cinnamon and milk, the unpleasant flavor remains.<br /><br />So yes, this coffee is effective, if you absolutely need to have coffee.  But if you're looking for a pleasant, low acid kick start to your day, black tea might be a better, tastier option."
3119,3119,3119,3120,4,"I didn't have high expectations that I would like this but I love coffee and have trouble with nausea from the acid. I am a Starbucks fan and while this was not as full bodied as that it was surprisingly good. Nice to not have the acid issues that come with coffee, this did not bother me at all or make me nauseous. I still prefer the taste of Starbucks houseblend but now I'm not sure the extra body is worth the acid. This is a good alternative that i found i liked better and better as i got use to it. Give it a try!"
3120,3120,3120,3121,5,This is a great company.  And the first I have ever seen to offer a low acid option. You can absolutely taste the difference. It's coffee without the bitterness.  Makes it possible to enjoy the purity of the bean without the bitter taste. They also have very cool black mugs.  Love them!
3121,3121,3121,3122,1,"I drink 10 cups a day of Verona, Italian, or French roast coffee, and wanted to try a lower-acid version. This brand of coffee smells and tastes like vinegar. It is totally unpalatable and you are better off drinking water if the acid in coffee bothers you."
3122,3122,3122,3123,1,This coffee tastes so nasty I can't even drink it. It's disgusting. I can't believe anything this bitter is acid free. I actually threw away two bags.
3123,3123,3123,3124,1,"Flavor may be something that has to be given up with low acid coffee, but I decided I'd rather take massive doses of Pepcid and drink regular coffee than subject my tongue to this awful swill."
3124,3124,3124,3125,2,"This coffee smells really bad - there is definitely no ""delicious"" smell as it brews or as you take sips from your mug.  It tastes just as awful too.  The first couple sips that I had, with my nose closed so I couldn't smell it, wasn't too bad but the more sips I took the more disgusting it was.  It is absolutely stomach turning (to me at least) and unfortunately I will never drink the whole bag. It tastes like a weak, poorly brewed, cheap cup of coffee (though not cheap!).  The only positive note is that it did not irritate my bladder - just irritated my nose and taste buds."
3125,3125,3125,3126,4,"I use this in my breadmaker but make it with warm milk and an additional egg, which greatly improves the texture. When made with just water and a small amount of butter, the crust comes out very, very chewy in my breadmachine. I have also made this bread and used carrot juice in place of the water, which makes it a beautiful color and naturally sweet."
3126,3126,3126,3127,5,"I have tried many bread machine mixes and most have been okay but this one rates an ""excellent"" because not only is it a very good basic loaf, it also works very well with additives, either prepared entirely in the bread machine, or (after the second rise) removed from the machine, shaped and baked on a stone in the oven.<br />Stretched and flattened with a filling of either savory or sweet ingredients, then rolled and set to rise and then bake in a loaf pan, it produced excellent herb and onion bread, cinnamon raisin bread and a brown butter and seed bread.<br />I buy it via the subscribe-and-save plan as I use it often."
3127,3127,3127,3128,5,"I love fresh bread and Hodgson brand is awesome. i usually just use the dough cycle on my bread machine and then form the dough in buns and stickss so i can easily take them on to go. even if the brand is not organic all the ingredients are natural and processed without chemicals. but most of all they taste great. all it requires is some water and shortening(butter, or oil). i have even been able to use applesauce instead of oil but it didnt get as rich taste. I have ordered all varieties they had on amazon, whole wheat honey is specially tasty. no more supermarket bread!"
3128,3128,3128,3129,5,"I must admit when I first ordered this bread for my new Panasonic bread maker, I was not expecting anything other than potato bread such as I buy at a nearby store. However, was I ever surprised! It was absolutely the best stuff and with some organic butter piled high and properly melted it was on a par with ambrosia. I just could not believe how good it was and is. Since the first loaf, I have made other breads which have been generally excellent but none are quite at the level of this potato bread. It is REALLY good! Perhaps the credit goes to my new bread machine! Highly recommended!!!  GENERAL INFO: The package makes a 1.5 pound loaf. On my machine the recommended setting is BASIC and the loaf bakes in 4 hours. Also, the flour is NON GMO Verified as labelled."
3129,3129,3129,3130,5,"Since I started making Hodgson Wholesome Potato bread, my husband will not eat store bought bread anymore!  We make about two loaves a week, in different varieties of the Hodgson Mill brand.  The honey whole wheat and white bread mixes are also great.<br />I like using my old bread machine to make the dough, then shape into loaf and bake in the oven.  Makes perfect loaf every time, also makes delicious rolls.<br />Glad I discovered this brand of bread mixes on Amazon--they are wholesome, and I know what I'm putting into the bread I bake now.  Great product!"
3130,3130,3130,3131,5,"i used extra yeast and a little more water and it came out very light with a heard crust, which i like. i will order it again. not much of a potato taste but good bread"
3131,3131,3131,3132,5,I recently purchased a bread machine and I tried  this potato bread mix.  I have made it three times now and it has come out amazing each and every time.  The other great thing about this particular mix is that I have experimented with altering the amount of Butter ( in the last batch I actually doubled the butter amount but then added less water) and it came out buttery and yuuuummmmmmyyyy!!<br /><br />I encourage everyone who has a bread machine to try this particular mix.
3132,3132,3132,3133,5,"I am so totally satisfied by Hodgson Mill products & I probably have purchased > 100 loaves at this point.  I used some as a present to my brother with good results, too.<br /><br />Never have I seen ""old"" smelling mix nor have I ever had a yeast failure.  Their taste & texture is wonderful. Never have I had a ""slicing failure"" where you can't get a slice to hold together long enough to lay it down. The different types lend themselves well to adding ingredients such as Chopped Nuts or Sesame Seeds or Millet Seed or - - use your own imagination.  Coming in nice units of 6 loaves makes pantry storage easy, and once opened, the carton yields 6 boxes with ""Best By"" dates easily accessible on each so rotating your shelf stock is almost ""goof-proofed"".<br /><br />Next time you walk a grocery store, note the prices there! Here again, I think you really can't beat the quality with a really fair price that Hodgson provides.  It seems to me that they have expended great effort to have the best product they can produce & the best shipping available for their customers.<br /><br />Buy with great confidence based on my experiences with them during the last 2-3 years.  I hope this helps decision making."
3133,3133,3133,3134,5,"UPDATED: 12-02-2010 - Finally have found a perfect 'match' in taste to my IRISH grandmother's potato bread. Loaf pictured w/dill added.

Also going to try as 'flat breads'<br /><br />Honey Wheat on the way - 2 sets delivered an hour ago - Potato and Caraway Rye<br />Now to make a choice which will come first."
3134,3134,3134,3135,4,"I love this bread.  I don't even like the smell of commercial bread; you can smell the chemicals from miles.  I added rosemary, garlic and olive oil to the mix and serve it just out of the machine; it was a hit with my dinner guests."
3135,3135,3135,3136,5,"This was great - so soft, so tasty.  Better than expected.  Perfect loaf every time."
3136,3136,3136,3137,3,I was a little disappointed...I first made the muffins with it and then let the bread machine make and bake a loaf - ok.  Next I will try mixing it myself and baking in my oven.  I do have to keep in mind though that potato bread is dense and heavier than say white bread.  Convenient is a plus.
3137,3137,3137,3138,5,"I have tried a few of this brand of bread mix in my bread machine and while all have been good I must say to my family and I that this is the best! I have made potato bread from scratch in my bread machine and this is right up there with that. Nice flavor, great texture, well worth the price! I have bought this a few times on Amazon and will continue to do so!"
3138,3138,3138,3139,5,"I am extremely satisfied with both Hodgson Mill Bread Mixes that I purchased online.  The potato bread mix actually rose and stuck to the top of my bread making machine and became entangled in the mixing blade, so it was difficult to remove.  Otherwise, the bread tasted great!!  The Rye bread was also delicious.  It didn'nt rise as much, and I had no trouble removing it from the bread machine.  The rye loaf was much denser than the potato bread loaf.<br /><br />The only drawback to purchasing these products online was the shipping costs.  I have since found out that I can purchase the same brand products at HEB and Kroger grocery stores, and will not order online, again."
3139,3139,3139,3140,5,"I just got my Bread Machine for Christmas, so being a novice I thought I would try to Keep It Simple :)  The Hodgson Mill Products are wonderful.  Everything is included even the yeast.  The Bread came out delicious, it was easy to slice.  It is like eating a country white bread not soft n mushy like traditional white bread.  My family enjoyed this it makes great toast as well. If you try this I think you will be happy with it"
3140,3140,3140,3141,5,"This is a fantastic bread mix. I do not use the bread machine, I make it in a bowl, hand made, and have had no problems at all. I do not know why people are having any problems with this. It is terrific. Amazon, please keep this in stock. Please."
3141,3141,3141,3142,5,"I like this bread, and several other flavors in this brand.  This one and the seven grain are my favorites.  They bake consistently well in my Wolfgang Puck machine.  Recommended!"
3142,3142,3142,3143,5,This product is as good as any that I have ever used and is so convenient through Amazon as it has become hard to find in the stores.
3143,3143,3143,3144,5,I love these bread mixes. There is nothing like making your own bread. I admit I use a bread maker - not clever enough to use my hands- but I still enjoy the experience. I have tried 2 different Hodgson mixes and they are both excellent.
3144,3144,3144,3145,4,"The potato bread was easy to mix, rises well in my breadmaker, cooks as it should and best of all was very tasty. The bread has a near white bread texture, and was very good. I purchased all of the Hodgson mixes and this was one of my favorites."
3145,3145,3145,3146,5,I recently tried this line of breads on vacation and loved the one we tried. I couldn't find the European Cheese & Herb flavor that we had locally so I went to order from Amazon.com. As happens from time to time the seller was out of that flavor so I picked up the Potato Bread instead and it was also very good.  I still need to get the Cheese & Herb because that one was awesome.
3146,3146,3146,3147,5,This is delicious bread and I can quickly make up loaves of bread to eat or give away for a special gift.
3147,3147,3147,3148,5,"My family and I all agree that Hodgson Mill Potato Bread is one of the best mixes on the market.  A loaf of this bread lasts about two hours before it is gone.  It has become a favorite of ours, and we will be making lots.  Don't run out of this one!"
3148,3148,3148,3149,1,"I have made potato bread before with great results but this Hodgson bread-mix is way too dry, it needs some more moisture-don't buy it unless you want really dry bread."
3149,3149,3149,3150,3,"howdy y'all,<br /><br />this bread is pretty good. the potato flavor is there, recognizable as potato bread [if you've had it before] and not overwhelming. makes a good sandwich bread with meats or an enjoyably different pseudo-bruschetta base.<br /><br />made it with vegetable oil and olive oil. as usual, the good olive oil makes for a somewhat better flavor.<br /><br />rated a THREE cuz it's just exactly as expected - average with no surprises.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee"
3150,3150,3150,3151,2,"White bread is not my thing, so that's probably why I don't like this one.  I like herby white breads and really full-bodied white breads, but otherwise I always choose whole grains.  This one is not full-bodied and has no particular flavor.  Not interesting at all to me."
3151,3151,3151,3152,3,I am a bit disappointed.  The flavor was not what I wanted or expected.
3152,3152,3152,3153,3,"As a former chef-owner of a restaurant in my younger years, I was  surprised and delighted at the exceptionally good taste and texture of the Bookbinder's White Clam sauce wihtout doctoring.  It is a great product for easy convenience."
3153,3153,3153,3154,5,"To the gentleman who reviewed this and said ""just go to the store and get better,"" well, I'm disabled and the disability van only allows us two packages to carry...can you see me carrying two big cases of water home?  I think not.<br /><br />This is wonderful water.  Sure, you could get it on sale at a better price, and if you can drive or have someone to drive you and carry it in, please do so, but for me it is a sweet deal.  I ordered six cases and watched the UPS guy set them inside the door for me.  I have nothing to complain about.  If the price is right for you, with all considered, you won't go wrong here."
3154,3154,3154,3155,5,"This water is delicious. I'm not picky, but I can taste bad water with chemicals or metal taste and this has none of that. And at 50 cents per bottle, delivered to your door, it's a great price. I have a teenage son and he drinks these all the time and it's a-okay with me. Better than drinking a coke."
3155,3155,3155,3156,5,"I continue to buy this water (as well as the larger size bottle) for a number of reasons:<br />1) The taste of the water is just plain good, refreshing, crisp and clean - it's not easy describing water that doesn't actually offend!<br />2) Our filtered municipal water still sucks and this is an excellent alternative for someone with health issues<br />3) The UPS guy does all the heavy work for me - all I have to do is put it away<br />4) I never have to run out of bottled water by availing of the discounted subscribe and save program<br />If I had any complaint at all it would be that the plastic bottle itself is quite heavy and can be a real pain in your backpack.<br />Bottom line for me, the taste and convenience are worth the price and I'll continue to buy it as long as my budget allows.**UPDATED note** I've been drinking this water for four months now and had an interesting experience that bears sharing: my local Kroger had Ozarka Spring Water on sale so I picked up a case - wow was that ever a mistake. Even though the Ozarka bottles are very light weight, the taste of the water is so different from TalkingRain Spring Water in that there is a distinct ""plasticy"" flavor. I've alway enjoyed the Ozarka in the past but had no idea I was settling for drinking ""plastic"" water...my goodness how my taste buds and senses have changed since drinking the pure goodness on TalkingRain Spring Water...I am totally convinced it is worth the extra cost now."
3156,3156,3156,3157,5,"I am a chemist, so I know about water, and why it can taste like heaven (e.g. it is tasteless), and why it can taste like sweat (e.g. ""mineral-enhanced.""). This water is expensive - cheap for online, but costly if you are a Walmart or Target shopper. However, I highly recommend you try this, if you want tasteless water. You see, when water is mineral enhanced, and its swirling around through the various protrusions and undulations the road provides in the summer heat, the water tends to build a certain taste, which some like, and others don't. I like my water tasteless. Therefore I recommend this product to those whom do not want H2O + minerals, but just plain water."
3157,3157,3157,3158,5,"This was my first purchase of this water.  It tastes great and the bottles are thicker than most.  Also, everyone likes that name...haha"
3158,3158,3158,3159,5,"Water tastes good. I typically prefer only purified water (did a study on this in grad school back in the day) but for use at the office, this fills the bill. I think it tastes good and looks presentable.<br /><br />Bottles are (of course) recyclable, so I don't feel guilty saying I like the quality of the bottle as well. I once had someone pickup water, and they got a chain grocer brand at a steal - but the bottle was so flimsy. I don't like that one bit. This is the best of both worlds.<br /><br />Shipment arrived fully intact for me."
3159,3159,3159,3160,5,"Always glad to see this water delivered to our doorstep. Not a drop of it spilled during delivery yet, due to  nice quality of  bottles.<br />Even though the delivery box itself has arrived bashed in, with the tape flopping, - must say the shrink wrapping has held, and the bottles themselves haven't spilled a drop of the water.<br />  We're on our third case of  it right now, and very happy with this purchase.  The water tastes good and the bottles hold their shape.<br /><br /> About weight  of these bottles commented upon in another review... I thought the comment was interesting and it reminded me that yes, I do drive a few bottles to work in the car, I don't backpack them.  Not a really obvious difference in weight, though, I think. Maybe necessary for shipping?<br /><br />  Guess it's like choosing sleeping bags...if you are using a vehicle, you can  use a heavier sleeping bag, so they tell me.<br /> Anyway, I think you'll like this water, and you get 30 bottles per case, instead of the usual 24.<br />We plan to order more.  We're glad we can do this."
3160,3160,3160,3161,1,"Three of us tried it; one of us was barely able to drink it, with ice.  I guess this is, like Evian, an ""acquired taste.""  Unless you're able to try a single bottle before purchase, I recommend you pass."
3161,3161,3161,3162,5,"This water is really good!!!!!  It is reasonably priced!!!  It is mountain spring water!!!  Please order at least once, you will not regret it.  It is priced right.  You get 30qt---16.9 ounce bottles for a great price.  Use your standard shipping 5 to 8 days (i think) free shipping.  That way, you can buy more product.  Be aware, that this is very popular product and sometimes, Amazon is out of stock.  So, you may have to wait 2 or 3 weeks.  BUT, it is worth the wait.  It is a great product!!!!"
3162,3162,3162,3163,5,"i thot i was satisfied with the spring water i have bought elsewhere UNTIL i bought this brand! best i have ever tasted. no chemical aftertaste.  i have 2 cases a month delivered since i also use it for all cooking needs and ice cubes too. it is soooooo delicious when making a glass of lemonade from fresh lemons with the aforementioned cubes with agave sweetener. mercy! as others have stated, the ups man does all the hard work and i don't have to worry about running out of the most important staple in my household."
3163,3163,3163,3164,5,"I bought this water for my 2 pet chinchillas, Tank and Tony. They love this water. I have never seen them drink so much in their lives! I bought this water because chinchillas cannot drink tap water, and Spring Water is the best for them.<br />I am mad though, because I purchased this item ~1 week ago and now it's $5 cheaper. Wtf?<br />Overall, I love this item. Great water.<br />I tasted it for myself, and it does taste great!"
3164,3164,3164,3165,5,"Love this water.  Feels silky smooth and clean when you drink it.  Really love the bottles.  Nice and sturdy.  No squishy plastic.  And since I had hard time buying and carrying from the grocery store, love the automatic delivery to my back door!  A little more money than store brands, but well worth it."
3165,3165,3165,3166,2,I have a recurring shipment of this product each month.  Every month when the boxes arrive they are barely in one piece and VERY mangled.  Last month one of the cases of water had to be repackaged before it arrived and it was a day late.<br /><br />I suggest using a more sturdy box for shipping.<br /><br />The water product is fine ... it's just the shipping packaging I have a problem with.
3166,3166,3166,3167,4,I enjoyed this water.  It was very refreshing.  I find I have some stomach sensitivity with some bottled waters.  I did not have that problem with this water.  Nice bottles.  Water comes from Washington.
3167,3167,3167,3168,3,"This water is pretty good, but not great. At the time I got it, it was the most economical water that shipped free with Prime, so if they keep that up, it will be a great deal for a lot of people.<br /><br />I might be tainted, because I was just up in Washington, where this water is from, and almost all of the bottled water I got up there, plus the tap water, was better than this. But, I love Washington water, so I'm probably judging it too harshly<br /><br />It's not bad, and it does have a unique water taste, so I'm sure this will be someone's absolute favorite water. No one will hate this water.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+This is good water<br />+Has a unique taste<br />+Everyone will like it, but not a lot of people will ask for more<br /><br />Cons:<br />-I expect more from Washington water than this"
3168,3168,3168,3169,3,"I bought this water when i was at college for the first week. I felt bad using my roommate's water all the time and i was 7 states away from home. So i ordered this water. It was delicious, but the only complaint i have is that the bottles were REALLY...well...plastic-y. I felt really un-green drinking water out of these HUGE plastic bottles.<br /><br />So now, i just ask my roommate to buy water for me when she goes home on the weekends. I give her $ 4, she runs to walmart and gets me 2 cases of 30 water bottles. Yay me!<br /><br />Sometimes i still think about this water, longing for it as i sip my coffee or tea or ramen-juice and say to myself ""This would be so much better with talking rain.""<br /><br />Its one college student's battle between deliciousness and eco-friendliness."
3169,3169,3169,3170,2,"Somehow my previous review got deleted. I live in Houston, TX. I buy lots of bottled water-cannot tell any difference between a bottle of Talking Rain and a glass of cold tap water."
3170,3170,3170,3171,1,"Yes the water appears clear, but once the water is heated for tea it turns the tea cloudy. Why is that, well it means it has impurities. Perhaps bacteria?? I'm a Registered Nurse not a water expert, but I can tell you that I am right about the water. I can run my well water from my tap and get the same results, it's awful.  I normally use Brita filters with the pitcher provided and when I heat or even boil the water the tea stays clear. This Means no bacteria have been killed off by the heating process, it means you'd be better off drinking the Brita water!!!!!! I gave this bottle water a chance I got a second case and the same thing happen. I wouldn't drink this water straight from the bottle ever. As a nurse I know it's not a good idea.  If you ever want to know if water is good or clear of bacteria/impurities you can make Lipton tea hot then, as it cools down IF the tea turns very cloudy it has dead bacteria and other impurities. I used the ice cubes made from this bottled water as well, so nothing is different except the tea.  Tried the Brita water and Brita made ice cubes and it remained clear.  Sorry not a good review from me I am afraid.<br /><br /> I was very disappointed as I thought ""yeah"" a bottled water I can carry to work, so I am not force to pay $1.50 for a bottle from the machine, but it turn out not to be so.<br /><br />Okay, so I tried another company on this website Nestles which in my region came as Deer Park. I have never tried this brand but it is so much better it doesn't,t turn cloudy when I boil it.  So you be you own judge."
3171,3171,3171,3172,5,"Though this coffee was expensive compared to regular store-bought, I am a huge fan. Coffee usually tears up my stomach so I've been a tea drinker for years, but this coffee has a low-acidic level so I can handle it. The aroma is enticing and the bag lasted a long time. I am a fan of beans versus grounds so that was another plus. It was prompt and the packaging ensured my coffee stayed fresh and intact."
3172,3172,3172,3173,5,I tried this milk chocolate with hazelnuts for the first time recently after reading a review that this brand was the best chocolate in the world. I had to try it and it was worth every penny. I am a dark chocolate fan normally (70% is my favorite) but I have to say I would order this again and give it as a gift. It melted like butter in my mouth and was beyond delightful.
3173,3173,3173,3174,1,"Do not buy this if your thinking its only mango.  Ingredient says ""Fruit Juice Blend (Organic White Grape Juice, Organic Apple Juice And Organic Pineapple Juice From Concentrate, Organic Mango Puree.""<br /><br />I cancelled order as soon as I realized this drink had grape and pineapple."
3174,3174,3174,3175,5,I bought this juice because I really like mangoes. It is great refreshing and smooth beverage that everybody in our family enjoy. Will buy again.
3175,3175,3175,3176,5,These are great spices to use on all food types giving a great flavor.  The bottle sizes are twice the size of that found in a supermarket and about the same price.  So you get more of what you would normally pay for.
3176,3176,3176,3177,5,"These are, without question, the best ""diet"" crackers I've ever had.  I've had them with and without salt and since I usually put peanut butter on them, I didn't need the salt.<br /><br />These are great for travel, for kids, and when you just need a very low-calorie cracker."
3177,3177,3177,3178,5,"I am not sure why the 2 speciality stores in my area stopped carrying these as they were usually sold out. The cakes are 18 calories, crunchy and good--not like the cardboard taste of thicker rice cakes. Excellent as a base for PB&J, or to make an open face sandwich, or to use in pieces like a chip for dips, etc. Good price on the 12 pack with a 10 month expiration use date."
3178,3178,3178,3179,5,"These stay together better than round ones, which crumble terribly. They are good alone, or with my favorite Artisana Raw Sesame Butter. They are very well packaged which keeps them from getting broken. Also, each package I have opened has been fresh. Thanks for a great product Amazon!"
3179,3179,3179,3180,5,"I love this product! So much better than the regular thick rice cakes. They are thin, but very compact, so I use them as a great sandwich bread alternative. They don't break apart quick as easily as the regular rice cakes. I've searched the grocery and health food stores in my area and can't find this product anywhere. I love that they are now available for Subscription through Amazon.com."
3180,3180,3180,3181,5,"These brown rice cakes are by far the best, I have tried many. I can not have very many foods. These are my only snack food that I can have. They are so good I dont feel like I am missing anything."
3181,3181,3181,3182,5,"I waited long and with bated breath for Amazon to restock the bulk packaging for this product, as European-style rice cakes are a pretty specific niche, and they can be a bit difficult to find at local stores (not to mention expensive). These are a very different beast from the American-style rice cakes that most people associate with the name--as other reviews suggest, these aren't quite so air-filled or crumbly, having more the density and thickness of a cracker or crisp flatbread. But unlike those, these are gluten-free, oil-free, unsalted, and contain only one ingredient: 100% puffed brown rice. They've got a nice light crunch that makes them good for snacking, but they're a lot healthier than chips or crackers, and the brown rice is definitely preferable to a more processed white rice cake if you're mindful of blood sugar impact. They're also great for the occasional mild tummy upset, since they're light and bland and don't require the preparation of other bland foods.<br /><br />Try them with hummus! My personal favorite: peanut butter, jam, and a sprinkling of chia seeds. Yum!"
3182,3182,3182,3183,5,"I am so happy that Amazon got these back in so I could order my second case. I don't eat wheat, it packs the pounds on me around my middle. Most breads have wheat or if they are gluten free, they cost way too much.<br /><br />I have eaten all kinds of rice cakes. I have found that most will break apart if you're spreading a nut butter on them. Not these! Also there are generally 13 rice cakes in a pkg of round regular rice cakes... this package of rice cakes has 27 pieces in each bag. Also, it's much like consuming a slice of bread without the crusts and they are nice and thin so you don't eat too much of a good thing.<br /><br />Try these if you're dissatisfied with regular rice cakes or if you must have gluten free bread!! I don't believe you will be sorry and Amazon's price is so good and FREE shipping... though the box is sort of big, it's pretty light and stores easily away. I live alone and I'm on my next to last pkg from my first case and they are not at all stale. I stored them in my cool dark garage in their original cardboard box.<br /><br />Also they are made in Belgium if that helps anyone. The packaging is air tight and they come 12 pkgs in a box and are in the perfect sized box, and mine arrived without a sign of any damage and I have yet to find even a single cracked rice cake! They are rather neutral in their taste... I make a special butter spread that I like on them real well. You take equal parts of room temperature butter, olive oil and water and blend ingredients until smooth. You can refrigerate this, it sets up but doesn't get hard so it is always spreadable and tastes really good! I use organic butter, olive oil and filtered water, but you don't have. This spread is so good and I believe it's better for you than straight butter.<br /><br />Also, I only use one cake to make a single sided sandwich, as with any rice cake using two as you would two pieces of bread just doesn't seem to work as well. But a single sided sandwhich with these rice cakes is very enjoyable!<br /><br />Hope this helps you decide to try them. Everyone I've given some to, have had only good comments about them."
3183,3183,3183,3184,5,"Surprisingly tasty. Thin and crip. Very Cracker like and good for snacking. I got these for my husband who is on a very low sodium diet. These are great for when we travel.  It isn't easy finding prepackaged low sodium foods that taste good, but these work quite well."
3184,3184,3184,3185,5,"Crisp/crunchy and thin- very low in sodium. I usually prefer mine plain but shared a package with a friend who enjoyed these with a tuna salad topping. A great alternative to the expensive styrofoam varieties sold at most stores. Excellent product. The rice cakes for this brand are also wonderful and for those on a no salt diet, 0% sodium."
3185,3185,3185,3186,5,"These crackers are great--the beauty is not in their own flavor, but the fact that they are a perfect, crispy, low calorie, gluten-free delivery mechanism for all manner of spreads and slices.  They don't come with over-powering artificial flavorings to compete with a topping of your choice.  Some of my favorites are...peanut butter and banana or laughing cow cheese with turkey pepperoni."
3186,3186,3186,3187,5,"I live on salt and as a result have hypertension. These products work surprisingly fast to lower your high blood pressure and to put it as nice as possible, keep you alive longer. And, that is a scientific fact, as salt is only a habit and has no real useful pupose except to cause many unhealthy habits and conditions. Keep caring about us and don't stop producing foods that are very healthy."
3187,3187,3187,3188,1,"Consumer Reports rated these crackers the highest in inorganic arsenic of all the rice crackers on the market. I like these crackers, but will no longer eat them until the arsenic issue in brown rice is resolved."
3188,3188,3188,3189,5,These are not only a good value (health food stores really jack up the prices on rice cakes!) but also are nicely thin and easy to use to spread stuff on.
3189,3189,3189,3190,5,I was able to do so much with these crackers!  they're easy to spread on and stack and put toppings on!  I definitely enjoyed them and so did all my friends =D
3190,3190,3190,3191,5,"Susie's thin cakes are a great snack if you are trying to lose weight or just eat healthy. I bought the one that is sodium, cholesterol, fat and sugar free. For three cakes it is only 54 calories, so you can add a toppin like taboule or your favorite topping without the guilt. They are very tasty. The only problem is the availability of the product. I am on a waiting list with Amazon for this product."
3191,3191,3191,3192,5,I purchased these based on others recommendations. The rice cakes are delicious. Thinner than the usual rice cakes in the supermarkets. Dense...not full of air. I covered them with PB2 (those watching their weight can eat peanut butter for 45 calories a serving vs 190 for regular PB and it tastes exactly the same). I too highly recommend these rice cakes.
3192,3192,3192,3193,5,"Brew it correctly and you really get a beautiful cup of tea.  I highly recommend this brand.  It is by far the best bagged green tea I have found, and I have tried about all of them.  I brew one bag in a 12 oz mug for 2 minutes.  Absolutely perfect."
3193,3193,3193,3194,5,"If you like green tea that brews for 2 minutes max and you do not ""stew"" your tea by just leaving the bag in until the tea is bitter, this is the tea for you! Of course, it can be done that way, but IF you have refined tea taste, then you will like this tea. I, personally, love the taste of a good green tea. I am so glad to find this brand available online. No one sells it in my area."
3194,3194,3194,3195,5,"I have tried many different brands of green tea, and this one is, by far, the best one that I have ever tried! The taste is so delicious and each tea bag is tightly sealed in its own special packet, which keeps it totally fresh until you use it. Even the strings are totally natural, with no metal at all, which can affect the taste of the tea. This is my new favorite tea, and I am so glad that I discovered it!"
3195,3195,3195,3196,5,"I used to get these from Sam's Wholesale Club, but with this economy, I have not renewed my membership .. so long story short, I bought BumbleBee canned clams and they were HORRIBLE .. so then I bought Geisha Baby Clams and they were not as horrible, but I certainly would not put them in MY clam chowder, so I returned all the unopened cans of BumbleBee and Geisha and am never ever gonna buy them again ... oh, you go right ahead and try those other brands if you don't mind eating POOP .. 'cause that's about all you get .. Clam Juice, and Clam Poop.  Doxee Snow's Clams are ALL CLAMS and CLAM JUICE no clam poop."
3196,3196,3196,3197,1,"I've been eating Snow's clam chowder for years, so I buy a few cans when it's on sale. Well it looks like Bumble Bee has taken over. What a big mistake. When I opened the can, it was all watery and smelled funny. I put it in a bowl to microwave, and noticed how thin it was, but thought I'd try it anyway. It was nasty to say the least. It about made me sick. So I went and opened another of the new cans, more of the same. Then I got an older can of the non-Bumble Bee chowder and it was great like always. If I could give the new junk no stars, I would. Sucks bad."
3197,3197,3197,3198,3,"the clams we're ok overall, quality ext accept only calf the can is filled with clams and the other half is mostly juice. also i expected larger chunks rather than small pieces. product is good though."
3198,3198,3198,3199,5,"This is the mother load of canned clams. Not just a can of juice with a few floaters, but cups and cups of chopped clams. I found no sand residuals,and I was able to use every last drop of juices.Simply devine recipe on the can, best white clam sauce I've ever made..."
3199,3199,3199,3200,4,"I guess I thought of this can as being the usual commercial #10 can, so the Price of about $16 a can did not seem too bad, but when they arrived I saw that these were somewhat smaller.  They are less than a half gallon.  I don't see the size as that much of a problem. All I have to do is rethink how I would use it in a recipe and free shipping helped with feeling better about the purchase, but if I saw that size can in a store I would not pay $16.00 for 51 oz. can.<br /><br />I would have to see what fresh clams would cost first.  I would like if they made the clams bigger chunks, but I could buy some fresh to add to it.  Most clam chowder is made with bigger chunks than what Snow makes.<br /><br />Good product despite the price!"
3200,3200,3200,3201,4,"Not much to say. I ordered two large cans of ""Chopped Clams"" for some clam chowder that I will be making soon and they arrived in good condition and in a timely manner.<br /><br /> I have not opened them yet but will in February at my boss's home in the country. I will be making clam chowder in his kitchen with his wife's blessings. There will be a small group of us there and we will be shooting guns as part of the day's activities. I hope they like the clam chowder! Things could get ugly... L.O.L."
3201,3201,3201,3202,4,"These are great beans for the price. If you live in a big city, however, I'd suggest buying green beans at a local Ethiopian shop or even a community Coop. I also remember a Pea berry out of East Timor that was outstanding, but this Tanzanian Pea berry is comparable to standard beans."
3202,3202,3202,3203,5,"We have been using this food for about 6 months now and find it to be just excellent! Other than the fact our two dogs (a Coton de Tulear 15lbs, and Standard Poodle puppy 40lbs) both love the food, but are thriving.  Their coats are in excellent condition and their overall structure is perfect.  Good tasting to the dog and good for them and a good deal for the owner.  All around the best food we have ever used.  Excellent!!!"
3203,3203,3203,3204,5,"I'm glad my 45lb cocker/standard poodle puppy loves the stuff because I trust the brand and its superior nutrition. Compare labels! My previous feed (Pedigree) was mostly corn. My little dude is healthy and happy and high energy and has a glossy coat. Also, superior nutrition produces smaller, compact stools."
3204,3204,3204,3205,5,"I received the K-cups on time and in execellant condition. I usually drink coffee, but at night the Hot cocoa is good with a snack, just before bed."
3205,3205,3205,3206,4,This is the best hot cocoa I've had in a K-Cup!  The taste is smooth and creamy.  It's perfect for a cold morning or an evening hot drink.  I would definitely recommend this product.  The best part is that it can be ordered on auto delivery so I never run out.
3206,3206,3206,3207,5,"I'm pregnant and had to,give up my hot cup of coffee. I thought maybe a hot cup of this will suffice? Sure does! Throw the kcup,in- and this is the best hot choc ever! I choke down my vitamins with it too! Worth it and so cheap here!"
3207,3207,3207,3208,5,This is quite the buy compared to other hot chocolates. The kids love it quick and easy.I will order this hot chocolate again.
3208,3208,3208,3209,5,Kids loved it. Great product at a great price.  My little one can make her own hot cocoa without my assistance.
3209,3209,3209,3210,3,"Even on the small cup setting of the elite, these are a little weak for me.  Make sure you shake the cups before putting them in your machine or they will be way too weak.  I also run a cup of hot water thru the maker before using these so there is no coffe taste to them."
3210,3210,3210,3211,5,"The hot chocolate is my husband's favorite.  Service was also great, as it usually is.  Very popular now with winter coming on."
3211,3211,3211,3212,5,I like the rich dark smooth taste of the Grove Square cocoa. It is the best I have found in K-cups and I have been on auto delivery for at least a few months now. Delicious!
3212,3212,3212,3213,1,"Looks like and tastes like chocolate colored water. No chocolate flavor whatsoever, this was a complete disappointment.  I got the hot chocolate k-cups from swiss miss instead.  How people can be giving this product four and five stars is astounding to me, is the Amazon ratings system being gamed for this product?"
3213,3213,3213,3214,5,"Excellent coffee for people on a tight schedule. My Fiancee fell in love with my brother in law's and had to have one! Now, everyone that visits our house has to try a cup and keeps coming back for more. Also like the fact that there's a wide variety of coffee flavors to choose from."
3214,3214,3214,3215,4,The kids love the hot cocoa and I like the fact that I can get the stuff shipped to me when I need it without worry of order.
3215,3215,3215,3216,5,This was the best purchase that I could have made for my daughter. It was priced beautifully and my daughter can study without worrying about the price for her college books. Thanks so much!!
3216,3216,3216,3217,4,AS  A CHOCOHOLIC FOR  MANY YEARS I CRAVE A GOOD CUP OF HOT CHOCOLATE.  THIS DONE IN THE KEURIG IS REALLY EASY AND FAST.  THE MILLK CHOCOLATE<br />IS TASTY AND THE DARK CHOCOLATE TASTES LIKE THE MANY CUPS OF COCOA I HAD AS A CHILD.  NOT PARTICULARLY CARRIED AWAY BY THE  PEPPERMINT<br />FLAVOR BUT IT WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH  TO MATTER.
3217,3217,3217,3218,5,My family loves all three flavors. The dark chocolate is my favorite.  The price was unbeatable.  I will buy this product again.
3218,3218,3218,3219,2,"I found this too sweet. Am hoping there's an unsweetened version available. Not very chocolatey too, kinda like Swiss miss."
3219,3219,3219,3220,1,It has artificial sweetener which not only taste bad to me but also gives me a headache. This should say light or diet to let the buyer know this. I would have never bought it had I known. It seems like it would taste good otherwise.
3220,3220,3220,3221,5,It tastes good and is little sweet so my first thought was that it had a lot of sugar.  I looked on the box and was surprised that it did not have that much. (a plus for me)
3221,3221,3221,3222,2,"I have to admit based on most of the reviews I was sold on getting the 48 pack.  Was a mistake. All three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose.  That is the name of the artificial sweetner, in the product.  If you like Splenda,you may like this.  But, it has a distinct taste. Unfortunately not for me. A few friends of mine that tried it and said,""It wasn't bad."" Unfortunately, that was the best of the comments.<br />If you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try Cafe Escapes or Swiss Miss.  Both are twice as good in my opinion. Liked the Escapes best.  Wish I liked the artificial sweetner, but the that taste has a distinct after taste. Probably would be better without the artificial stuff and more regular sugar. If your going to order I would get the small pack to try it.  Better then throwing out 30.  Try Cafe Escapes and Swiss Miss and see for yourself."
3222,3222,3222,3223,5,This is the best Hot Cocoa product I have found for the Keurig K-cup Brewer. The others I have tried do not have the test or alot of the product remains in the cup.
3223,3223,3223,3224,5,"They have some really good hot chocolate. I got a single pack before and it was so good that I reordered some more. I like to make a mocha by brewing one of these and then one coffee (use a big cup).<br /><br />One thing to note: these dont have a strainer inside, the entire contents are meant to be used (unlike the coffee Kcups) so it will feel empty once done. I would not recommend brewing on the smaller cup settings. Use a standard mug or larger because the smaller settings wont get all the chocolate from the inside to come out.<br /><br />Also, kids may not like the peppermint flavor.... But that is my favorite one. If you don't want to get the variety pack, they sell the individual flavors too."
3224,3224,3224,3225,5,"I brew the 8 oz cups, 10 and 12 makes it too thin. It's good at that point but adding some creamer, whipped cream, and or cinamin always improves it."
3225,3225,3225,3226,5,Husband and Grandaughter LOVE this cocoa... Make it for them all the time as I drink my coffee.. My husband is a very picky person but for some reason he really likes this one product and wants me to keep it in stock here at the house.. Loves it at night after dinner on cold evenings.
3226,3226,3226,3227,5,"These k-cups are awesome.  They taste no different (Personally, I think better) than those which are priced three times as much!  I highly recommend this product!"
3227,3227,3227,3228,5,"I have purchased other hot cocoa cups but find Grove Square to be about the best of them all.  I usually add two teaspoons of the the flavored coffeemate creamers, my favorite being the Sugar Free Caramel Macchiato.  By adding the sugar free creamer the taste is there but not the calories."
3228,3228,3228,3229,5,"The most chocolatey and smooth hot cocoa ever, Yum! It has the best price and taste for the Keurig K-Cup Brewer. Way better then at least 3 other peicer brands--we've tried different ones and this is the best and super super fast delivery. Thanks"
3229,3229,3229,3230,3,Makes pretty good cocoa and a lot easier than on the stovetop.  Not as sweet as I would prefer and needs to be stirred to keep it in suspension.  I guess I can add marshmallows:-)
3230,3230,3230,3231,4,"Arrived quick and on-time, and what a great value! Definitely pleased with my purchase, and will likely buy again =)"
3231,3231,3231,3232,5,"Great option for excellent taste, price, and convenience. A repeat customer on these! We order these now in the 36 pack instead of getting at the grocery store."
3232,3232,3232,3233,5,"Grove square Hot Cocoa is just the right amout of milk chocolate, not to much chocolate, just the right mixture. Delicious! I say a good cup of hot chocolate. Try Grove Square Hot Cocoa, Milk Chocolate K cups for Keurig Coffee Makers. Enjoy! I did."
3233,3233,3233,3234,5,this hot coca tastes pretty good when brewed on 8oz setting however its not the best I've ever tasted nor the worst. its hard to rate this because everyone has different tastes so its ether you like it or you don't. I my self happen to like it and will buy again unless I find something better.
3234,3234,3234,3235,5,This is a great buy.  I love this hot chocolate because it is very low in sugar and has a good taste.  It isn't messy like regular hot chocolate as it is all dissolved before it hits the cup.  Would buy again.
3235,3235,3235,3236,5,"Yum!  All the convenience you expect with a K-Cup with all the flavor of real hot chocolate.  The kids love it, and so will you!"
3236,3236,3236,3237,5,I really like the flavor of this hot chocolate.  The kids love the flavor too.  I always keep a box of this in the house as my kids and their friends are avid coco drinkers.  This makes it easier and less messy even for the younger ones.  No more powder spilled on the counter tops this way!
3237,3237,3237,3238,5,This is one of my wife's favorite. Grove Square has another great product to share with Kcup users.  Now we need some specials  to bring the price per unit down.
3238,3238,3238,3239,5,My husband and I both love this hot chocolate. We are on the auto shipment for every other month and we are going to have to change it to every month!
3239,3239,3239,3240,5,My family really enjoys Grove Square Hot Cocoa Milk Chocolate and we keep a supply on hand.  The excellent price is what made us choose this brand but the taste is what makes us continually renew our order.
3240,3240,3240,3241,5,I have tried several types of hot chocolate since purchasing my Keurig and this is by far the one I enjoy the most.  I have it shipped every month so that I don't worry about running out!!!
3241,3241,3241,3242,5,"I liked the milk chocolate version, so tried this.  It is just as good, and with the more intense chocolate flavor, appeals to my chocolate desires."
3242,3242,3242,3243,1,"When I bought my Keurig brewer, I eagerly looked for other beverage options for my wife who is not a coffee drinker.  I'm still looking.  The Grove Square Hot Cocoa had a nasty aftertaste, almost metallic.  No amount of cleaning/tinkering with the brewer made any improvement.  I used the brewer to make hot water for a Nestle Hot Cocoa pack, and that was a far superior beverage.  The Grove Square quickly found it's way to the trash.  I'll find quality mixes and use the Keurig to heat the water from now on."
3243,3243,3243,3244,3,"It's okay but it does not have a rich chocolatey taste. I actually find it to have a funky taste, can't quite figure it out."
3244,3244,3244,3245,5,"After trying several brands of Hot Cocoa my kids have decided that this is the one for them.  I'm certainly happy about it because not only is it delicious, but it's also more affordable.  3 boys can consume a box of hot cocoa very quickly, even with limits set.  It's also very convenient to have it shipped automatically.  If we don't drink that much I simply skip a month.  If friends come over and we drink a lot, I just order an extra box.  It's quick, simple and delicious."
3245,3245,3245,3246,4,"To everyone worried about not getting a full cup to run through your machine with these k-cups, here's the trick.  Put it in your machine, close the lid, open the lid, turn 90 degrees, close the lid and repeat two more times.  You should have closed the lid on the k-cup four times by now.  Next step is to hit the brew button.  The problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through.  With the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good.  Would have given them five stars if it was able to run through the needle like it is supposed to.  Could have been a little thicker overall, but not bad."
3246,3246,3246,3247,5,"the greatest, best chocolate taste in any keurig k-cups out there. will definitely order more. everyone in the office tries to steal them. i'm a chocolate nut, and these pass the test."
3247,3247,3247,3248,5,I have tried different brands of hot cocoa from dark to milk and the Grove Square milk chocolate k-cups have by far been the best.  They're big critics in my family and they have given two thumbs up.  I would recommend anyone who enjoys hot cocoa to purchase this brand.
3248,3248,3248,3249,5,great product for keurig coffee maker. works fine with coffees and cocoa mixtures. Is good for just hot chocolate. like purchase price
3249,3249,3249,3250,5,I enjoy the selection and they have all met my expectations so far.  My sister wioll not try any favor but milk chocolate but I am glad I brought the variety pack anyway
3250,3250,3250,3251,5,This hot chocolate is much better than other k cup hot chocolates I have tried.  It is not watery.  I have tried both the milk and dark chocolate version and like them both.
3251,3251,3251,3252,5,So far Grove Square has the best hot chocolate K-cups.  We have tried a couple others but they don't compare.
3252,3252,3252,3253,4,"When I was talking to a neighbor about getting a Keurig she told me not to get cocoa.  This was in a group of beverages that I got when I ordered my Keurig and I think it is very good.  It is rich, creamy, and exactly what I want when I want a cup of cocoa!  I would order this again."
3253,3253,3253,3254,5,This Hot chocolate is very good. It has just the right amount of milk chocolate flavor. The price is a very good deal and more than worth it!
3254,3254,3254,3255,5,"I don't ven know why i ordered these, it was just on a whim. But what a surprise when I brewed myself some hot chocolate. The taste was unbelievable, just like homemade. Maybe a tad too sweet, but a tiny little bit of instant coffee added to it did the trick. Love it."
3255,3255,3255,3256,3,"I was expecting something more... considering the Keurig does such a good job with coffee.<br />But this stuff? Everybody who sampled it here said it tasted just like Nestle's powdered hot chocolate in a mug with hot water. Watery, sugary, and nothing special."
3256,3256,3256,3257,5,this item has an awesome chocolate flavor. i would recommend this product to anyone looking for hot chocolate for their keurig or any machine that uses k-cups. Great product
3257,3257,3257,3258,1,I was hoping this was a good idea.  However we tried them even after I heard they tasted bitter like artificial sweetner and it was true.  Not the same as the stuff from the can.
3258,3258,3258,3259,5,Ordered this in the colder weather and it was great in the morning. Very easy and fast to prepare in K-Cups.
3259,3259,3259,3260,3,"I saw these on sale so I nabbed them.  For anything larger than a 6oz cup, the results will be too weak.  I end up brewing one with 6oz of water and then a cappuccino or something on top of it.<br /><br />The peppermint was the flavor I was anxious to try but it ended up being the dark chocolate that I loved the most.  I'm on the fence about ordering hot cocoa k-cups in the future.  It might be better to stick with canned cocoa and just use the water from my Keurig."
3260,3260,3260,3261,4,The Grove Square Hot Coco K-Cups have a good flavor but I find that the k-cups do not have enough hot coco mix to make that perfect cup. Thus I recommend putting a little less water in order to make each cup just right.
3261,3261,3261,3262,5,"After drinking Swiss Miss watered down hot chocolates taste for so long, this is a very tasty creamy hot chocolate. My kids love it so I tried it and its the best I had in a while. I will be ordering more."
3262,3262,3262,3263,5,"A pleasant surprise awaited me when I first ordered Grove Square milk chocolate Hot Cocoa cups. Not a coffee drinker,<br />I use our Keurig K-cup brewer mostly to make cocoa, and a few other brands I tried simply did not hit the mark. Grove Square cocoa tasted full-flavored, with just enough chocolate essence to make it a perfect drink. The first experience made me anticipate (with pleasure) the next time I popped a Grove Square K-cup into the machine!"
3263,3263,3263,3264,5,GROVE STREET HAS THE ABSOLUTE BEST HOT CHOCOLATE FOR THE KEURIG.  YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE HOT CHOCOLATE AVAILABLE TO SOOTHE AWAY THE DAYS ANXIETIES!
3264,3264,3264,3265,5,My mom and son love the flavor of this hot chocolate. Add a little bit of milk afterwards and 1 splenda and the taste is amazing.
3265,3265,3265,3266,5,"I was hesitant to try this cocoa after all the horrible reviews about how it tasted so bad, and had a really bad Sucralose flavor. I don't know if I'm just not as picky as others or what it is, but I thought this hot cocoa was really good. Creamy and rich, and almost TOO sweet. I don't think it has an ""aftertaste"" though, how some have described. I used the middle water setting on my Keurig or ""small mug""...7.25 oz., I guess. Everyone has their own tastes and preferences, but as for me, I really like this product!"
3266,3266,3266,3267,5,"This is hands down the best tasting k-cup hot chocolate available.  The Cafe Escapes or whatever the brand name is tastes very watered down and artificial, while this one tastes thicker and milkier.  I love the dark chocolate flavor, although if I didn't know it wasn't dark I probably couldn't have told the difference between it and a regular cup of cocoa.  I will stick with the flavor just because it will probably be richer than the milk chocolate option.  These are such a hit at my house when the weather is cool.  Everyone always wants hot chocolate!<br /><br />Something to note on this is that these work much better when used with about 6 oz per k-cup.  I use 2 k-cups per mug and the flavor is much better than when I try one (too watery)."
3267,3267,3267,3268,5,My grandson loves this.  He makes a cup everytime he stops over. It quick and easy and the taste is good.
3268,3268,3268,3269,5,"As far as single serve cocoas go, this is one of the best.  I wouldn't say it's as good as some of the handmade ones, but it's still good!"
3269,3269,3269,3270,4,"nice variety pack. has 3 dofferent hot chocolates in one package. milk, dark and peppermint. nice holiday feel. good for company during the season."
3270,3270,3270,3271,4,We received this order in perfect condition. I purchased this product for my mother-in-law. She likes the convenience of the product in the Keurig Coffee Maker. The chocolate does not stick to the sides of the cup like the cheap hot chocolate in the paper bags. Overall it tastes pretty good. It is a little weak but good. Use only on the small cup setting in the Keurig. 4 stars.
3271,3271,3271,3272,5,"I bought this because it was a very good price.  It was really good though.  I love mixing a peppermint with a dark chocolate and having a double sized up of hot cocoa.<br /><br />Will keep buying this until they don't sell it anymore. It is really creamy.  I like it best with 6 ounces of water, gives it a thicker feel."
3272,3272,3272,3273,4,"I was disappointed by the fact that all three boxes I received had already expired.  Luckily enough, the flavors had not yet degraded.<br /><br />I specifically bought these in order to get the peppermint flavor.  I was hoping for more.  The peppermint hot chocolate does not have much peppermint flavor to it, but we will still enjoy it and both of the other flavors."
3273,3273,3273,3274,5,I keep this on hand for the young at heart.  We enjoy a cup almost every night.  Good taste.  will buy again.
3274,3274,3274,3275,1,"So if you are a person who likes swiss miss / hot cocoa packets or hot cocoa from a gas station SO DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!  I can not taste any chocolate flavor in it whatsoever.  It just tastes like heated sugar water and nasty sugar water at that.  This product has a strong fake sugar taste and I am perfectly OK with diet sodas and other fake sugar products.  There is something about this I just can not put a finger on it but it made my stomach curl.  I even waited for it to cool down, but it got worse.  Very disapointed in this product and it was not what I was expecting at all."
3275,3275,3275,3276,4,"This is delicious hot chocolate. It is best at 8 oz cup, but can be stretched to 10. And 8oz of strong coffee and you have delicious mocha"
3276,3276,3276,3277,5,I've had many hot cocoa K-Cups and I must say this one is the best by far. The Green Mountain one has a half & half bitter aftertaste while the grove square is very pleasant and is as close as you can get without actually using milk.
3277,3277,3277,3278,5,"I really like this hot chocolate mix.  I was concerned, when I read some of the reviews, that I would not like it but I like it alot.  To me it has just the right amount of chocolate and is not to sweet.  I would recommend this product."
3278,3278,3278,3279,1,"All this is, is artificially sweetened hot cocoa mix that is placed in a Kcup delivery device.  What a waste of money.  Also, Grove Square products are notoriously inferior."
3279,3279,3279,3280,3,"My kids like this cocoa, but I find flavor less delicious than the more expensive <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VQXYMQ"">Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>."
3280,3280,3280,3281,2,very easy to use not the best flavor It has too much sugar and is not a quality I thought I was getting
3281,3281,3281,3282,5,The hot cocoa is delicious and is strong enough to make the larger size. I find all three flavors delicious with my favorite being the dark cocoa.  The best bang for the buck I have so far found for hot cocoa.  I tend to use my coffee maker for everything but coffee.
3282,3282,3282,3283,5,"Very good hot chocolate.  I have tried a few different brands, and this one is the best I have tried.  Should be priced higher for the quality you get."
3283,3283,3283,3284,5,"I've been buying this milk hot chocolate for months now and it's one of the best I've had.  I even got my in-laws hooked on it and my granddaughters absolutely love it!  Great price, great product!"
3284,3284,3284,3285,5,Just what I was looking for tired of going to the store to pick these up and always being sold out! I love the flavor not so sweet and just right!! Thank you! and will be buying again!!
3285,3285,3285,3286,3,"My oh my is this cocoa sweet. Too sweet I'd say. You're better off making hot cocoa from scratch. I bought this because I thought the minty flavor would be good, but it's too sweet. So are the dark and milk chocolate flavors."
3286,3286,3286,3287,5,"I was a little skeptical when I bought this, but it has really been a great purchase.  The cocoa is DELICIOUS!  It's so easy to just make my daughter and I some cocoa quickly before sitting down to watch a movie.  I didn't have to add anything to it, but I did add a tiny bit of milk just to cool it down.  I would definitely recommend this product and purchase it again."
3287,3287,3287,3288,4,I didn't read the reviews thoroughly and found out too late that this product has enough sugar to give it 60 calories and 11 grams of carbohydrate in each cup. I tried one with a bit of cream and found it to be very tasty. I'll keep it around for friends and family or perhaps an occasional mini-splurge. I'd like to see amazon include nutritional info in the future.
3288,3288,3288,3289,4,This is really tasty hot chocolate.  I like it much more than the dark chocolate flavor but that is just my preference...
3289,3289,3289,3290,5,"Good value for the money. These are good. The hot cocoa is excellent however, don't get the coffee cuz its instant!"
3290,3290,3290,3291,5,"Not bad at all when I use CoffeeMate CHOCOLATE creamer.<br />I still like swiss mix made with 2% milk a little better.<br />But as far K-Cups go, this milk chocolate with the Coffeemate Chocolate Creamer is not bad.<br />And currently, it is less than $11.00 for 24 cups."
3291,3291,3291,3292,5,My boyfriend and I really like these k cups. We have tried others and they were kind of gross. These are the ones we will stick with. Can't go wrong.
3292,3292,3292,3293,4,This is a great hot cocoa as long as you read the box and only use the 8oz setting on your coffee make. Otherwise it will taste watered down. Also it is an instant coffee so dont be surprised by it.
3293,3293,3293,3294,3,"The product is not bad, but must brew at smallest cup size or it has no flavor.  Definitely an aftertaste. Watery."
3294,3294,3294,3295,2,"A hot chocolate packet was the first K-Cup on my new Keurig (it was 1 a.m. and I wasn't ready for coffee before bed). I had read they ran a little watery but I decided to try it on the 10 oz. setting, took a sip, and tossed it. The next morning I made one with 8 oz. and added some whipped cream. The taste was kind of grainy and it was still pretty watery. My husband made one to try at 6 oz. and said it tasted like sugar water. I might try combining 2-3 6 oz. servings to use the box up but we won't be buying more."
3295,3295,3295,3296,4,"A good cup of hot chocolate...with a couple of marshmellows.  Make it for my daughter every time she visits. She is nearly 60, and she loves it."
3296,3296,3296,3297,5,All three flavors have a nice aroma and rich chocolate taste. Peppermint is our favorite. We enjoy a cup after dinner 'flavored' with a bit of creme liquor nearly every night. It's become a tasty habit.
3297,3297,3297,3298,4,This item had a great price and tastes great. The only thing that could make this product better is if the little plastic cup was recyclable or compostable.
3298,3298,3298,3299,4,"My husband and I really like this cocoa.  I add extra milk to my cup for a creamier flavor, but the convenience cannot be beat."
3299,3299,3299,3300,5,"great deal, especially for the price. Item arrived quicker than anticipated. This has saved me many trips to Dunkin Doniuts as well as saving me paying double the price for a cup of hot chocolate that's just as good. Looking for more to stockpile!"
3300,3300,3300,3301,5,Love them. Hardly notice any aftertaste from sweetener. I don't agree with some of the others that didn't like it...Will buy again...
3301,3301,3301,3302,3,This product is nice and the price is right but it isn't Swiss Chocolate for sure.<br /><br />Just doesn't have that real deep chocolate taste.
3302,3302,3302,3303,3,"I bought this brand of hot chocolate K cups cause it had the best review on Amazon at the time.  The kids love it - they especially like the peppermint flavor which I can't see any other way to get except in this mixed box.  You get milk chocolate, dark chocolate and peppermint flavors.  I tried it a few times and it is too weak for my taste.  I make it on the lowest setting on my Keurig which I think is around 7 ounces and it is still weak to me but perfect for them.  If you like a strong chocolate flavor this isn't it."
3303,3303,3303,3304,5,Wow what a deal. These taste just as good as the expensive brands. Most definately will be buying these again.
3304,3304,3304,3305,4,"I feel like I've tried every hot cocoa there is in the k-cups.  While I do think this is the best hot cocoa so far, it still isn't great.  I'm not sure what it is, but all of the cocoa k-cups seem to have a weird taste to them.  It's almost like there is artificial sweetener in them,, but I know there is not.<br />I set it on the smallest cup setting for cocoa.  This has more body to it than others.<br />I'm still waiting and hoping that Dunkin' Donuts will put out their hot cocoa in a k-cup.  There really is nothing better than that.<br />If you want a k-cup hot cocoa, I would def. recommend this over all the others."
3305,3305,3305,3306,3,"I HATE SUCRALOSE.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising.<br /><br />That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition.<br /><br />Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run).<br /><br />There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.<br /><br />My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me.<br /><br />So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.<br /><br />Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.<br /><br />I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself.<br /><br />So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.<br /><br />43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon."
3306,3306,3306,3307,5,"These Grove Square Hot Cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the Keurig. We took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really good.<br /><br />Dark Chocolate - My favorite, very good even on the ""large"" cup setting<br />Milk Chocolate - Excellent on the ""small"" cup and good on the ""large"" cup setting<br />Peppermint - Everyone likes this one, on either cup size setting<br /><br />These do contain Sucralose in addition to sugar, I don't notice the taste but my wife does (but she still likes them).<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
3307,3307,3307,3308,5,Excellent product! A tip from the Keurig people: shake the K-cup before using it. This prevents the cocoa from clumping and results in more flavor.
3308,3308,3308,3309,4,"I have read some really funny reviews about this product.  Some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup, so 'therefore' it must have been an instant mix!  Brilliant deduction, Sherlock!  What did you expect...to see choco-grounds in the cup?  Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that's why 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />But the taste is what you want to know about, right?  The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it.  Plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you'll have a real treat!  It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer.  Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  So, maybe a few mini-marshmallows instead of a full-sized one for this flavor.  Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate.  She wins, of course, but it's pretty good when I can get one.  No marshmallow needed.  The hint of peppermint is just enough.  6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too.<br /><br />I think I got the cups sizes right.  If I didn't, you'll figure it out.  Btw, I'd imagine the reason it's always out of stock is because people keep buying it!  I've dipped into the supply well a few times myself.  Pretty good. Pretty cheap. Pretty hard to get at times.  I'll buy it again!"
3309,3309,3309,3310,5,"Everyone in my family likes hot cocoa. I was running plain water through my k-cup maker and using hot cocoa from a canister but my kids didn't really get the right measurements and more often than not we would have overflow. So I decided to try this for my kids and it makes a perfect cup every time. No overflow. The taste is good, its creamy with enough cocoa to water ratio for my kids. I will be ordering this product from now on for my family.<br />In the interest of product comparison, we have ordered Timothy's white hot chocolate, and Green Mountain Hot cocoa, Timothy's was great, but pricy, and Green Mountain didn't really taste all that great to our family. It had a watered down taste to it."
3310,3310,3310,3311,4,"When I weigh the convenience of a K cup against the price and the taste, I would characterize these as a winner. Not the best cup of cocoa on the planet but compared to making it yourself or using a packet, these are pretty darn good. They nice a nice chocolate flavor with no funny after taste that I've had with some other brands. Do not select 10 oz on your machine though. Make it only at 6 or 8 oz otherwise it will be watery in my opinion. All in all a fine cup of hot chocolate."
3311,3311,3311,3312,5,"I am actually surprised at how good this product is. I am a Cuisinart Keurig owner with two teens that love to drink hot cocoa and cider pretty much year round.<br /><br />Price point: The price for these at the store ( exact brand ) is almost triple of what we pay here for the same amount, with subscribe and save this makes these quite affordable for my family use. In comparison to other more expensive brands it's a great bargain without sacrificing quality over quantity.<br /><br />Flavor wise: My kids love it, and have already asked me to purchase more. My daughter says that the peppermint is right on and not too weak even if using a larger cup. I love the dark chocolate in my coffee to make a mocha ( 10oz coffee to 4 oz chocolate ) and it's much better than some other brands that I have tried in the past.<br /><br />Overall impression:  Great value, good flavor, excellent price point I will be purchasing more."
3312,3312,3312,3313,5,"Ordered on a whim.  My first ""Grove Square"" purchase.  Great for the family's occasional cocoa desire.  Being a K-Cup it's fast and easy.  Was a little worried the cocoa might leave some after taste in my coffee, so far so good.  Great cup of dark, rich cocoa.  Maybe could taste a LITTLE better if it was from a gourmet brand you mix yourself with steamed milk.  The ease and simplicity, and lack of clean up, make this a better option for me.  Will order again.  Nice to see it on subscribe and save."
3313,3313,3313,3314,5,My box of Grove Square Hot Cocoa arrived today and I've just tried it. Delicious. Made a big cup [by mistake] but I'm happy with the flavor and consistency.  No off tastes that I can discern.  A little disappointed at high sodium content. Nice to have as fall starts to chill.
3314,3314,3314,3315,2,"I really, really dislike Sucralose.  I don't like the taste, the aftertaste, or the after effects.  I bought this based on it NOT saying it was ""diet"" or ""low calorie"".  The first ingredient is Sugar so it's only partially sweetened with Sucralose.  Sucralose is buried way down in the ingredients list but the taste is noticeable.<br /><br />Sure wish Amazon contained the full nutrition and ingredients labels from all food products."
3315,3315,3315,3316,5,"OK - this is not the finest European chocolate.  BUT, you can make it in your Keurig and all 3 flavors taste good.  I've joined the ""club"" and get the lowest possible cost.  No charge to join and no effort to quit.  Why not?  It's nice to have when you're dieting, because it's just enough chocolate to keep you on track.  Non-dieters will like it for the convenience."
3316,3316,3316,3317,5,"I've tried a few different Hot Cocoa brands for my Keurig... And have been disappointed EVERY time, until now! Cocoa brews smooth and full flavored-on either the small cup size or the medium! I add a splash of almond milk and I'm ready to go :) Perfect! I'll definitely buy this again."
3317,3317,3317,3318,4,I recieved a Keurig K-Cup Brewer for Christmas with sample cups of coffee and tea but no cocoa so I tried this brand and I like them but I haven't tried other brands yet to compare with. I would buy these again until I find one I like better.
3318,3318,3318,3319,4,"I see a lot of complaints about Grove Square hot chocolate. I think it tastes ok considering it's a k-cup, not homemade and not gourmet. I don't have anything negative to say the company or the product, it's relatively inexpensive and the company didn't falsely advertise or make any promises about the taste."
3319,3319,3319,3320,4,"I really like hot cocoa!  I like it sooo much that I have a Cocoa Latte machine, which is great, but sometimes I just want one cup of cocoa not a whole pitcher.  When that happens I used to put on the kettle and heat up the water, then pour in a packet of cocoa mix and stir, and stir, and stir.  And after all that stirring, I'd still get little lumps in my cocoa.  With the K-cups, I get smooth rich cocoa with NO lumps and NO clean-up.  Easy and yummy!<br /><br />Please note: THESE ARE NOT SUGAR-FREE.  The very first ingredient in each flavor is sugar and I did not see any artifical sugar listed in the ingredients.  Each cup has only 60 calories, but if you want sugar-free or are diabetic then this product is probably not for you."
3320,3320,3320,3321,5,Very good hot cocoa.  And price was right<br /><br />Awesome and passing the word on the item.  Will buy it again
3321,3321,3321,3322,5,"The thing I like most about this brand of hot chocolate is that once I remove it from the keurig, it doesn't leak all over the place.  For some reason, all the hot chocolates I've purchased before leak all over when you remove them from the coffee pot.  My coffee doesn't do that so not sure why that is.  This is a great deal for the amount you get as well, and taste yummy!"
3322,3322,3322,3323,5,I found this brand and the fact that it was dark chocolate made it by far the best I've had for my Keurig.  I will continue to order this particular brand.
3323,3323,3323,3324,5,"I love these hot chocolates. I think they're way better than the cafe express hot chocolates. These and the Swiss Miss hot chocolate are my favorite K-Cups. And the price of these are the best I've been able to find. My girlfriend and I have already gone through about half of them in about two weeks, and I never used to drink much hot chocolate.<br />I recommend these"
3324,3324,3324,3325,5,I really enjoy this hot chocolate with a little fat free half & half for creaminess. Being that I am not a coffee drinker these k cups offer a nice change from tea. The local stores sell this as well but it's half the amount of cups and almost the same price. Buy from Amazon.
3325,3325,3325,3326,4,"I like to brew a k-cup cocoa into my coffee for a nice mocha.  This dark chocolate flavor is quite nice, especially mixed with Double Black Diamond coffee.  Though not the very best, it is good, and the price is right, compared to other brands."
3326,3326,3326,3327,1,"Since I am willing to try alot of new things. I thought that I would buy this product.. And since I do like hot cocoa, I bought 2 boxes.. WORST thing I could have done.. This is bland, with very little flavour. It also has a grainy texture near the bottom of the mug.<br />Personally I will not buy this product again. I will stay with swiss miss or another hot cocoa brand for the Keurig K-Cup"
3327,3327,3327,3328,3,Does not have a rich chocolate flavor. Tastes a little watery. Not sure who a makes a great cocoa but this is not it.
3328,3328,3328,3329,4,"Taste was decent, a little sugary, but very creamy otherwise. Very happy with this product. I will be buying this product again. Packaging interesting, as it's a giant box for the product to float around in until it delivers to your house."
3329,3329,3329,3330,5,"Grove Square Hot Chocolate is the best K-cup hot chocolate. I read many reviews before making this purchase, and now I agree, and will continue to buy this brand."
3330,3330,3330,3331,4,My kids have been begging for hot cocoa k-cups and when I found these so reasonably priced I decided to give them a try.  We all loved them.
3331,3331,3331,3332,2,"This tastes like it has artificial sweetener in it and doesn't taste very chocolatey. The name brand cocoa Kkups are better, or just dumping a regular cocoa packet in a cup and running the water through into it is better."
3332,3332,3332,3333,4,"All three tastes rich and chocolaty, not chalky at all. We were surprised how good they are, better than any other K-cup cocoa we've tried."
3333,3333,3333,3334,1,"Just plain nasty!!! This item tasted like cardboard, very watered down and no flavor to it at all.  Very disappointed"
3334,3334,3334,3335,5,"This brand is by far the best K cup hot cocoa not that that says much, but it is thicker and less disgusting than the rest."
3335,3335,3335,3336,2,"Thin, runny, and the fake milk powder used to add ""creaminess"" has an off flavor. Better off eating your ceramic mug."
3336,3336,3336,3337,5,You can't beat this deal! 3 Boxes of 16 K-Cups for little more then $20. No other store can even match that price for Hot Chocolate K-Cups. Your normally going to be paying around $12-$16 for 16 K-cups alone. This package give you 48 K-Cups for a great price.<br /><br />The Hot Chocolate itself is great tasting and can be used on mostly all settings for the B70 except for the travel mug. Low in calories and great tasting. Defiantly a must have if you own a Keurig brewing system!
3337,3337,3337,3338,4,Not too sweet.  The best K-cup hot chocolate I've tried thus far. The kids loved drinking and making the hot chocolate.
3338,3338,3338,3339,5,"Grove Square is the best k-cup hot cocoa I've tried.  And I've tried a number of the other brands.  This tastes like ""real"" cocoa used to taste. And if you add a little milk it's even better. It's so hot from the Keurig that the milk helps cool it down anyway. If your looking for a real chocolate-ly flavor give this a try."
3339,3339,3339,3340,1,"I don't expect great hot chocolate from a k-cup, but it should at least taste like there's some cocoa in it. I can't believe how bad this stuff tastes. I tried it 3 times, and then threw the rest away."
3340,3340,3340,3341,5,"Best hot chocolate available for K-cups. Best taste, after taste. Great in any size when brewed. Highly recommend over any other company."
3341,3341,3341,3342,4,"Of the few Hot Cocoa flavors we've tried, this is the best so far.  It has the richest flavor and I dont notice the artificial taste that others have commented on.  Its also very affordable compared to other k-cups right now.  I thought that the k-cup making process must have gotten more expensive over the last year, but now I know they are truely sticking it to us since these are still reasonable priced."
3342,3342,3342,3343,5,"This is the absolute best hot cocoa for the Keurig Brewers. All of the other Hot Cocoa's that we have tried we had to ""doctor"" to make them taste good. We had to add more cocoa and more sugar. I was pretty much making my own cocoa, which defeated the purpose of the brewer. But the Grove Square Hot Cocoa does not need any help. In my opinion, It has just the right amount of flavor!!"
3343,3343,3343,3344,5,"Oh so good. The first cup I had was on the medium setting. It was too sweet. So I had my second on the larger setting and it was perfect! This is a creamy hot chocolate. Add a little milk and and whipped cream, and your set!!!!"
3344,3344,3344,3345,5,"I was quite pleased with e flavor of this product. A good, strong, yet not overpowering flavor.  Rich chocolate flavor. VERY pleasing. I highly recomend this product!"
3345,3345,3345,3346,5,"I'm giving this product 5 stars because I think it is great considering that it is made with water.  The hot chocolate is best if you shake the cup and then brew using the smallest possible cup size.  If you want a large cup of hot chocolate, use 2 k-cups.  It is fairly low in calories, most likely because artificial sweeteners are necessary to get all the ingredients into the little k-cup."
3346,3346,3346,3347,2,I wish I had listened to the other bad reviews.  The artificial sweetener taste is awful.  I gave two stars only because my husband doesn't seem to mind.  I can't drink this- even if they were a bargain.
3347,3347,3347,3348,4,"Better than expected, but the peppermint flavor lacks a mint smell or taste. This is a good purchase for the price."
3348,3348,3348,3349,1,"I looked forward to a delicious hot cocoa, but was very disappointed with the flavor. It has an awful aftertaste, like the taste you get after drinking a bad diet soda. Also kind of weak, even on the smallest cup setting."
3349,3349,3349,3350,1,"So bad, I returned it. My children didn't even like it, and they are not difficult to please when it comes to sweet drinks or food."
3350,3350,3350,3351,5,"KCups are a godsend; among KCups, these are near the top.<br /><br />The Keurig brewer is a blessing, hot beverages in seconds, mostly coffee; but there are greater and lesses among the coffees, and so, it seems, among the hot cocoas.<br /><br />This is so rich and vibrant, it announces itself from two rooms away.  Silky, smooth, bursting with all the things chocolate is supposed to deliver, it's a must-have in this household."
3351,3351,3351,3352,5,"This is the best hot cocoa I have tried for the Keurig.... Rich, chocolate flavor (I used the 6oz setting) and it is not watery.  If you like hot cocoa, and the convenience of a K-cup, this is the one to get!"
3352,3352,3352,3353,2,I bought this for my daughter and grandson. They both tried it at different times and they both said it had a funny taste and did not drink it. Therefore I will not buy it again.
3353,3353,3353,3354,2,"The artificial sweetener ruined this for me... It leaves the fake sugar taste in your mouth and my husband, who drinks diet soda, even noticed. At least it wasn't pricey."
3354,3354,3354,3355,5,Grove Square Milk Chocolate Cocoa k cups are great! I usually make hot cocoa from scratch with milk over the stove. I thought this was easier and delicious. To add creaminess I put in either a splash of milk or a shot of whipped cream--perfect!
3355,3355,3355,3356,5,"I ordered the hot cocoa for my grandson for Christmas.  He loves the flavor and is able to make it on his own.  Delivery was good, I had it in several days but still in plenty of time for Christmas.  Would recommend to anyone."
3356,3356,3356,3357,3,Good flavors in this combo. Not really strong but I will just set the machine on less water next time.
3357,3357,3357,3358,5,Love this brand. Great price with save and subscribe. My husband loves them. Top with whipped cream in a can and I have a happy man. I wish you could buy all pepermint cocoa.
3358,3358,3358,3359,4,"Great taste and does not have the weird chalky after taste that other hot cocoa k-cups have.  I've tasted several and this by far is the better one, but I have to say anything larger than 8oz tastes a bit watered down.  Will definitely purchase more, but at the rate my family downs these, we are probably going to stick to the powdered hot cocoa to be more cost effective."
3359,3359,3359,3360,5,I ordered this as a christmas present for my Daughter and Son in law. He tried it the day after Christmas and gave it 2 thumbs up.
3360,3360,3360,3361,5,"I bought a box of Grove Square Hot Cocoa because I love their Cappuccino French Vanilla.  I used the medium cup setting and added some whipped cream...it was to die for.  Very yummy and almost as good as homemade.  I never noticed an aftertaste like other reviews, but it could be because of the Redi Whip I added to it.  I highly recommend it."
3361,3361,3361,3362,5,My wife rates this  5  Stars. SHe is the chocoholic in the family and if you please HER...you please everybody .
3362,3362,3362,3363,5,I love the flavor that this hot chocolate has.  It is very rich and smooth.  Have tried other brands but did not get the results I wanted.  I will definately be ordering from this company again.
3363,3363,3363,3364,5,"Got a brand new Keurig machine for Christmas and immediately went to work finding the cheapest and best tasting K-Cups on the market. I came across this when searching for some good Hot Cocoa and am amazed at how many K-Cups you really get out of this. 48 K-Cups for about $20 when I purchased was a great deal when most Hot Chocolate prices were 16 K-Cups for $15~$19.<br /><br />This is a great deal and you get to try out Peppermint, Dark Chocolate and Milk Chocolate. It's light on calories and most important of all taste GREAT!<br /><br />Must have if your a Hot Chocolate lover or have family that wants a easy to make, great tasting Hot Chocolate for less!"
3364,3364,3364,3365,5,"Fantastic cocoa.  All the flavors are excellent but my personal favorite is the dark chocolate.  I received my Keurig as a Christmas present and I am loving cocoa at the end of the work day...no mixing, no microwave and positively no pot on the stove...just warm, chocolatey goodness on demand. Will order this product again"
3365,3365,3365,3366,4,"After trying many of the other hot cocoa k-cup options, I find that the Grove Square product tastes the best.  For my personal taste, I find that brewing on the medium cup size setting creates the best taste.  Just add minature marshmellows and it is a great treat.  However, this is not hot chocolate, which may be a turn off for some tasters."
3366,3366,3366,3367,5,"I have tried a number of k cup hot chocolates and grove square is by far the best yet!  Very nice flavor, doesnt have the nasty artificial sweetener flavor like a lot of the kcup hot chocolates.  very impressed!"
3367,3367,3367,3368,5,"I enjoy a good cup of Hot Cocoa on occasion, and this is ""good stuff""!!  Not only that but in a time where prices are out of control on K-cups, this product is very reasonable in price."
3368,3368,3368,3369,5,I bought these for my mom and she loves it.  She mixed eggnog with the dark chocolate.  She enjoyed melting pepermint candies in too.
3369,3369,3369,3370,5,"I bought this mostly because i wanted the peppermint hot cocoa, but i fell in love with the milk chocolate one.  The peppermint was pretty good as well...good cocoa!!!"
3370,3370,3370,3371,1,"I tried to find the ingredients for this hot cocoa before I bought it, but couldn't find anything online. Turns out it has one of those mile long ingredient lists, and yet, that didn't help the taste at all. It is awful.<br /><br />I had three boxes of the stuff sitting around for a month and couldn't find any takers. I finally got rid it of it at the Christmas White Elephant gift exchange at work. I put it with a nice cookbook, which was the real present, and wrapped it real prettily. Unfortunately, the boss ended up with it. I haven't asked him if his family enjoyed it because I don't want to put him on the spot. Judging by the reviews, there are a lot of people who like it - hopefully, he will, too. Maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained. Mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove, with milk, cocoa and sugar, and maybe a tiny pinch of salt.  Compared to that, this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment.<br /><br />Anyway, instead of trying one of the other brands, I now heat some milk in the microwave, stir in a couple spoonfuls of Hershey's cocoa and some sugar to taste. It takes about three minutes, and it's delicious. Now, where did I put those mini-marshmallows?"
3371,3371,3371,3372,5,"Sometimes, I'd rather have cocoa instead of coffee at work. This meets my cocoa craving. I do not need to add sugar - just add water and brew!"
3372,3372,3372,3373,5,"Everything you'd want from a Hot Chocolate...creamy, milky, tasty, makes you happy :) I can't wait to try the other flavors!"
3373,3373,3373,3374,5,"i have tried many brands of the hot chocolates but this by far has been the best.  now, i realize it is thousand percent cheaper to just use the package you can buy at the store and add water but if you want to impress than this is the product."
3374,3374,3374,3375,5,"Having tried all the varieties of hot chocolate k-cups, Grove Square's are by far the best.  They are very chocolaty, rich, creamy, and leave very little sludge in the bottom of your cup.  Yum..."
3375,3375,3375,3376,5,"I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I don't drink coffee and I was searching for more hot chocolates for my Keurig. I am a Milk Chocolate fan, but with Grove Square the Peppermint and Dark Chocolate are by far the better choice.Both have a sweetness I wasn't expecting. The flavor is great and I don't want to share. I am definitely reordering more."
3376,3376,3376,3377,5,This is by far the best hot cocoa I have found yet for the Keurig. I love the assortment and the peppermint is my favorite. I would give these try for sure if you are looking for some hot cocoa K-cups. All the other selections for hot cocoa that I have tried were just okay tasting. These are AMAZING!!!! LOVE THEM! I will order these for sure again!
3377,3377,3377,3378,2,"I just got a Keurig a few weeks ago and wanted to get some hot chocolate for it as an alternative to coffee.  I didn't have super high expectations, but these are absolutely awful.  There is a very strong plastic/chemical taste to these k-cups.  I tried all of them and tried putting some milk in them to help mask the chemical taste and nothing will help.  The only reason I gave these k-cups 2 stars is because my boyfriend can ""tolerate"" them, but I don't trust him because he'll eat just about anything.  In his opinion they are ""not that good"" but he will still drink the mug.<br /><br />From what I've read of other hot chocolate k-cups, you'd be better off just buying a regular mix and doing it that way!"
3378,3378,3378,3379,5,"After being disgusted by the brown water created by the Cafe Escapes dark chocolate cocoa, we were THRILLED to find these dark chocolate cocoa k-cups.  Delicious!"
3379,3379,3379,3380,5,"This is the best Keurig K-Cup hot chocolate you can buy. I've tried others, but will never buy any other brand again."
3380,3380,3380,3381,4,This Hot chocolate tasted very good!  The whole family liked it!!!  It is a nice change to make Hot Chocolate instead of coffee inthe Keurig coffee maker.  We wold purchase this again.
3381,3381,3381,3382,5,We had previously tried another brand of hot coca k-cups. We bought these since they seemed to be a pretty good value. We actually like the taste and flavor of these more than the other brand we tried. They have just the right amount of cocoa and sweetness. We like the variety of flavors in the pack also.
3382,3382,3382,3383,5,"I am so glad that this hot chocolate is available for Keurig.  Previously the brand of hot chocolate available was only so-so, but this is definitely better.  The variety pack is just right for every mood and every guest.  I never find myself with too much of any one flavor left over.  Move over coffee lovers, we cocoa drinkers have found a home!"
3383,3383,3383,3384,4,I have tried a few of the cocoa cups and find this product about average.  Unless you stir the cup the cocoa will taste watery for a few sips.
3384,3384,3384,3385,5,I've heard over and over that people are having a difficult time finding a hot chocolate pod to enjoy in their Keurig K-cup brewers.  The search is over!  This Grove Square Hot Cocoa received four big smiles from my sons. They just went on and on about how delicious it was!  I love having this new coffee pot where it's fast and convenient for all of us!  Super happy with this purchase.
3385,3385,3385,3386,4,"Reasonable in price, tastes good.  Prefect for Keurig, which can be pricey.  We will probably buy this again.  It is mostly for the kiddos anyway!"
3386,3386,3386,3387,5,"These are so nice and creamy!  Usually I don't justify buying k-cups for things like cocoa that you can get cheaper in a packet, but this is so convenient and very good tasting .. way better than most powdered cocoa packets I've tried.  As far as price comparison, it is equivalent to gourmet-types of cocoa that would easily cost $1+ per packet.  I also like that it comes in a variety pack with 3 flavor options.  Highly recommend"
3387,3387,3387,3388,4,"I ordered this wanting to try a hot chocolate on my Keurig, and I am very happy with this product. I will definitely be ordering it again. That being said, I dislike hot chocolate made completely of water, so I do add a splash of Half and Half to my cup when I make this. Thus, I didn't want to give it a 5 star rating since I do doctor my cup up a bit at home (otherwise I would have). However, I won't even venture to make a cup of hot chocolate in a packet from the grocery store with water, I use 100% milk usually for those and they still don't measure up to this product from Grove Square. So, the fact that this tastes so good made with water and a bit of creamer to me speaks volumes. I do have to say that this is by far the best cup of instant cocoa that I have ever tried at home. Compared to the Swiss Miss in the cupboard this had a distinctly grown up taste to it. I'm a big fan!"
3388,3388,3388,3389,5,"Great product at a reasonable price....my husband's favorite! Loves the dark chocolate although we get the pack of 3 that includes light, dark and peppermint also.  Shopped around and this is a bargain and surpasses the other cocoa k-cups we have tried in taste."
3389,3389,3389,3390,5,"I bought this item for my elderly  Mom, to use with the new Keurig Coffee machine I purchased for her. SHE LOVES IT!!!!!!......I WILL BE ORDERING MORE!!!!!!!!"
3390,3390,3390,3391,5,"Bought this as a gift and was told it tastes really great! Too bad I don't have one of those machines, otherwise, I'd try them out myself.  I might have to consider getting one! If you really like it, you can save some money by subscribing to it for automatic deliveries and to make sure you don't run out."
3391,3391,3391,3392,5,"This is great hot chocolate.....Not watery like some others and my husband really likes this one.....Thank you.  Pat Greenough, Boise, Id."
3392,3392,3392,3393,5,"We love this variety box in our house, we subscribe to ensure we never run out.  I use the 'Dark' to make Mocha, my wife loves the 'Peppermint' and i drink the 'Milk' whenever i fancy a hot chocolate.<br /><br />The Dark makes a great mocha, just do half a cup of the Dark Cocoa and half a cup of your favorite coffee, add whipped cream on top, delicious.  Also worth noting, you can try some of the flavored coffees in your Mocha and rustle up some great combos. I am not a fan of flavored coffee, i struggle to drink a cup but as a Mocha, delightful.<br /><br />Drinking the Peppermint or Milk as a hot chocolate, we add a little milk and whipped cream on top, delicious.<br /><br />I highly recommend this variety box if you are considering buying it. :-)"
3393,3393,3393,3394,2,"Well you get what you paid for. While this milk chocolate k-cup is pretty cheap $12.95 per 24 (54 cents per count) but it is not good. It tasted like watered down chocolate (as if you put in too much water and not enough milk or chocolate/cacao for that matter). This thing is sweet tho, in fact kinda too sweet for my taste (i am beginning to think half of the powdery content is sugar/sweetener). I thought it was the amount of water that made it taste watered down so I lowered the cup size from 8 ounce to 6 ounce on my Keurig brewer and it's the same thing."
3394,3394,3394,3395,5,I've tried ever single brand of K-cup hot chocolate and this is absolutely the best one. It is the only one that actually tastes like the real stuff.
3395,3395,3395,3396,5,"great price for the 24-count, my dad will love this gift since he loves hot chocolate and drinks about three cups a day, quick to receive."
3396,3396,3396,3397,4,"It appears a little watery, but the taste is not bad at all.  If you have kids that are as fascinated by the Keurig as you are, they'll probably enjoy this."
3397,3397,3397,3398,5,"I enjoy this cocoa very much, the children love it and drink it often.  I would purchase this product again."
3398,3398,3398,3399,5,For the price I think the cocoa cups are very good. I will order them again. They are nice to have in the house for the grand children and the holidays
3399,3399,3399,3400,5,Great tasting product and is much better than other cocoas I have tasted in this type of single serve. Job well dont grove square!
3400,3400,3400,3401,5,This is the best cocoa ever. It beats out anything you can buy in the store.  Sometimes<br />I just mix it in my coffee and it's wonderful.  Highly recommend.
3401,3401,3401,3402,4,It's a pretty good sub for the coffee shop version. No mess and the S&S price is great! I like that the box has perforations to remove part of the side so that it functions as a dispenser.
3402,3402,3402,3403,3,"I like it ok, but it isn't anything great. I have a hot water tap and it is just as easy for me to make the powder packs at home at a fraction of the cost. I'll go back to that method and save my $$ for coffee."
3403,3403,3403,3404,4,"This is actually better than I expected when I paid less than 50 cents each.  We usually use a packet mix and hot water from the brewer.  This is much easier and the taste is comparable.  If you are very particular you may not like this but for something quick, sweet, chocolate flavored and warm for around 50 cents it is worth a try.  I would not buy it at the regular price that some retailers ask."
3404,3404,3404,3405,4,"Getting really good cocoa out of a K-cup is not easy but this is much better than the others I have tried. Still a little wattery, but at 60 calories it is a nice treat.  very rich flavor - not as good as the real thing, bit I am not drinking it in a Berlin Chocolate shop either.  Put your slippers on, sit in front of the fireplace with your sweetie, and enjoy!<br /><br />60 cal (20 fat)  --  2g fat sat  --  11 carb  --  6g sugar  --  &lt;1g fiber"
3405,3405,3405,3406,5,"This hot chocolate is great am so glad I doubled the order ,you can not miss with this .Now I have quick hot chocolate for the kids and grandkids"
3406,3406,3406,3407,2,"This is much too watery. It tastes very much like the tasteless hot cocoa one gets out of a vending machine.  After receiving the box and reading the list of ingredients,  I've decided not to order again.  This product if definitely not worth the money."
3407,3407,3407,3408,5,We recieved the product on time and in excellent shape. It tastes good and meets our expectations. Thanks for the excellent service.
3408,3408,3408,3409,4,"Funny thing - I bought some of these K-cups several weeks ago based on the strength of the reviews at that time.  I just got them last week and have had a few cups since then.  I'm using 8 ounces of water to prepare the cocoa.  I thought they tasted pretty good - reasonably chocolaty and smooth.<br /><br />They were sweet, but not overly so, and the richness made me check the calorie count on the box.  60 calories - hey, not too bad!  It wasn't until now that I came back to place a review and I read the most recent reviews from others did I realize they use artificial sweetener.  Honestly, if I hadn't read it I would have never known - I didn't detect anything that gave me the hint when I drank it.<br /><br />I think if you like a quick cocoa on the run you'll be happy enough with these K-cups.  Are they as good as a Swiss Miss packet from Costco?  Maybe not, but in my office I don't want to deal with getting powder on the counters and needing a spoon to get things mixed.  You'll sacrifice a little for the convenience, but to me it's well worth it."
3409,3409,3409,3410,3,"Unfortunately, I am conflicted with my purchase.<br /><br />Although the final product was quite good, 4 stars. The quality of the delivery is why they lost an additional star. I opened the Amazon box to find that there was hot chocolate powder coming out of the Grove Square packaging. I opened it to find that 2 of the K-Cups weren't sealed properly on top and were spilling into the box. I inspected both the Amazon package and the Grove Square both of which had no visible exterior damage.<br /><br />I was disappointed with both Grove Square for the quality of their product and as a result I am not sure I would buy this product again."
3410,3410,3410,3411,5,"Everything about the order went great, the Hot Chocolate is very good. I will be ordering this again probaly soon."
3411,3411,3411,3412,3,"The flavor of this cocoa is good, but I found that it was a little too watered down with the normal amount to water. The second cup was better when I used less water."
3412,3412,3412,3413,4,I am amazed how well these little cups taste.  These Kcups taste very well.  This hot chocolate taste great and are ready in one minute.
3413,3413,3413,3414,5,"I recently purchased a Keurig and I bought the Cafe Escapes dark chocolate cocoa from their site, and it was not chocolately and had a strange aftertaste.  I saw the Grove Square brand and thought I would give it a try since I got 36 kcups for less than the 24 from Keurig. I received my purchase yesterday and immediately opened it up to try it.  The cocoa actually has sugar in it and the chocolately flavor is much better than the Cafe Escapes. I will be ordering this one again, and I hope my guest will drink the other kind to get rid of it!"
3414,3414,3414,3415,2,"With <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00389Q4XW"">Green Mountain Hot Cocoa</a> being perpetually out of stock in the winter, I thought I'd give the cheaper Grove Square brand a shot.<br /><br />Since the K-Cup patents are starting to sunset, Grove Square is one of the first ""unofficial"" producers of ""we can't legally call these K-Cups but they work in your Keurig(R)(TM) coffee maker"" pods, and I thought that I'd be getting the same overall quality, without the licensing fees tacked on to the price.<br /><br />Well... I was right about Grove Square being cheaper. But I think that's the nicest I can be.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, there's a definite ""diet"" or ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6LBXK"">Splenda</a>"" aftertaste. This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure.<br /><br />""Well... it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want."" and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious ""diet"" sweeteners.<br /><br />The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.<br /><br />The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.<br /><br />If you drink diet soft drinks by choice, you're probably going to like this."
3415,3415,3415,3416,5,"We have tried many of the different hot cocoa k-cups...everything always tasted so watered down, even when using the smallest setting on the machine.  However, this brand...even at the medium cup setting, tasted fantastic.  I highly recommend Grove Square.  I haven't tried any of their other products, but I would be inclined to now based on this cocoa."
3416,3416,3416,3417,5,"These Grove Square Hot Cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the Keurig. We took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really good.<br /><br />Dark Chocolate - My favorite, very good even on the ""large"" cup setting<br />Milk Chocolate - Excellent on the ""small"" cup and good on the ""large"" cup setting<br />Peppermint - Everyone likes this one, on either cup size setting<br /><br />These do contain Sucralose in addition to sugar, I don't notice the taste but my wife does (but she still likes them).<br /><br />Highly Recommended! We tried these in the smaller variety pack, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q64K"">Grove Square Hot Cocoa Cups Variety Pack, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 12-Count (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />CFH"
3417,3417,3417,3418,1,This tastes terrible...  Like putting aritficial sweetener in already sweet hot chocolate.  The best I have tried so far is Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate K-Cups.  Don't think they are sold on Amazon yet...
3418,3418,3418,3419,2,"Had I known this cocoa was sugar-free, I would not have purchased it. I realize that this will not bother some people, but I really don't like the aftertaste of fake sugar.  In the interest of fairness, this did not seem to trouble my nephew!  Just update the description."
3419,3419,3419,3420,2,My whole family(7 people) tasted all 3 flavors and they are sickly sweet.  Very disappointed that product has sucralose.  I wouldn't buy it again
3420,3420,3420,3421,2,"Using 8 oz water as the directions state made the cocoa much too weak. It was like hot water with a few drops of chocolate syrup. Using 6 oz made the cocoa much too sweet, and still too weak in the chocolate department. It uses sucralose as a sweetener, which gives it a very intensely sweet flavor. This may not be a problem for those who like very sweet things or don't mind the taste of sucralose. Unfortunately, I'm not one of those people."
3421,3421,3421,3422,5,"Perhaps not your Grandma's cup of Hot Chocolate, but for the Keurig, it's the best out there.  And what makes it a sweeter deal you get 3 packs for the typical price of 1 K-Cup box, take note it's a Pack of 3, so a total of 36 k-cups.<br /><br />I suggest only using the small cup setting to prevent it from being watered down too much, but decide for yourself!"
3422,3422,3422,3423,5,"Truthfully, I wasn't expecting too much with this, but thought I would give it a try for something different for my Keurig. I have to say, that I was pleasantly surprised at how good this is.  My favorite is the dark chocolate, but the peppermint is very good as well.  I am not a real milk chocolate fan, but I mixed it with some coffee for a mocha and it was very good. I would definitely purchase this again."
3423,3423,3423,3424,4,As you know finding a hot chocolate that taste great and is brewed on the keurig is a big challenge. Well this hot chocolate is quite good. The flavor is rich and the hot chocolate has some creaminess to it. I made it for my daughter and toped it off with whipped cream and she loved it.  Will be drinking lots of this on now that it is begining to get colder.
3424,3424,3424,3425,4,"although this isn't a perfect cup of cocoa, it's far superior to the others that i have tried. i will order this again."
3425,3425,3425,3426,5,"This is by far the best K-cup hot cocoa we have tried.  It has a nice rich flavor and with the added convenience of a K-cup, it is easy to have a cup anytime you like. Highly recommend!"
3426,3426,3426,3427,5,"Out of all of the hot chocolate kcups that I have tried this is by far the best one. Not weird aftertaste, and not watered down. Tastes amazing and priced fairly, what more could you ask for?"
3427,3427,3427,3428,5,These k-cups are just what my son wanted!  The price was excellent and the flavor is rich.  I would recommend these to anyone wanting a good cup of instant hot cocoa.
3428,3428,3428,3429,5,I am a big hot cocoa drinker so this hot cocoa I would definitely recommend it has a great cocoa flavor and it's perfect for those cold fall or winter days. Warms you up plus tastes great!
3429,3429,3429,3430,1,"Can't tell you how this tastes, because I read the ingredients first, but it has trans-fats in every flavor. :( The seller should disclose all ingredients in the description. I wouldn't have purchased this otherwise."
3430,3430,3430,3431,1,"I received my order of Grove Square hot cocoa mix today, and was very shocked to see that hydrogenated oil was one of the ingredients in the mix. I have avoided using any products that contains trans fats because of the negative effects on blood lipid levels. I would urge Amazon to require an itemized list of ingredients for all food items listed for sale. If the ingredients had been listed, those of us who have concerns about our health can avoid these products."
3431,3431,3431,3432,5,"I mainly use my Keurig for coffee but thought I'd try this one since I love dark chocolate and it was getting mostly good reviews.  I've tried some other chocolate K-cups and had given up on them since they all seemed pretty watery.  If I can taste water I don't consider it real hot chocolate.  I was pleasantly surprised that this tastes much better than the others I've tried.  (I must admit there are many I haven't tried, but I don't really feel like making a big scientific study of it.)  This will be my source of hot chocolate from now on.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed to see how many ingredients it contains.  That sort of thing worries me a little.  Still, I don't drink hot chocolate that much, so I think I'll survive.  I'll copy the ingredient label here for those concerned plus a few items from the nutrition info:<br /><br />Calories 60, from fat 20.  Trans Fat 0g. Sodium 200mg. Sugars 6g.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: sugar, glucose syrup solids, cocoa (processed with alkali), partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (may contain coconut, soybean, sunflower, palm and/or canola), modified whey, maltodextrin, salt, natural and artificial flavors, cellulose gum, sodium caseinate, cornstarch, lactose, dipotassium phosphate, sucralose, mono- and diglycerides, silicon dioxide, soy lecithin, artificial color. [Contains milk and soy.]<br /><br />(I always hate seeing artificial coloring in ""dark"" chocolate products.)<br /><br />If I had hot chocolate every day I would consider making it from scratch with more cocoa and fewer chemicals, but since I enjoy the convenience of having it nearly instantly from my Keurig on the occasional whim, I'll just keep a box of these K-cups on hand.  I highly recommend it for the taste, it isn't easy finding good hot chocolate."
3432,3432,3432,3433,1,This does not taste like cocoa it is very weak no matter what cup size you use.I is just not good.
3433,3433,3433,3434,1,"When I got my Keurig I fell in love. I bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa. I'm a bit of a hot cocoa nut, partially because I can't have caffeine, and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards. I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me. I also took it to a friend's house and have tried them in three different Keurig machines, JUST to make sure mine didn't need to be descaled. So I guess my suggestion is to try it before you go for the multiple boxes."
3434,3434,3434,3435,1,"I ordered this product because of a good price deal.  Amazon shipped accordingly, absolutely no problems there.  However, the taste of this product was horrendous.  It tasted as if someone through chemicals in a cup and told me to brew it.  I personally will go back to buying Swiss Miss in a can and just using the Keurig to give me Hot Water, cheaper and much better tasting."
3435,3435,3435,3436,1,"This has to be without a doubt the WORST tasting Hot Chocolate ever! The best way to describe the taste of ""This Stuff"" is really cheap suger free instant hot chocolate. Swiss Miss instant is way better and cost less. After only 3 cups threw the rest in the garbage where it belongs and canceled my subscribe and save for this ""SLOP""!"
3436,3436,3436,3437,3,"This is okay cocoa. It's not really very smooth, and it's a little watery. I had high hopes, as I love dark chocolate hot cocoa, and the reviews were good. I will finish the box I bought, but will try another brand next time."
3437,3437,3437,3438,3,just got a new keurig and was looking for a great chocklate drink/still looking/this is fair at best/watery and nothing to brag about
3438,3438,3438,3439,4,I haven't actually tried drinking these just as hot cocoa but I know the peppermint flavor is great as a creamer for the Van Houtte Mexican coffee...I'm ordering another box as this adds just the right amount of chocolate to my coffee.  Been trying to find a coffee flavor that does that but so far adding these to the coffee has worked out better :-) I usually have 14 oz at a time so I run 4 oz through as hot chocolate and the other 10 as coffee. I did try another brand of kcup hot cocoa and it wasn't as good as this brand.
3439,3439,3439,3440,5,"We have a new hot beverage cooker. This thing is the closest thing to the futuristic ""replicators"", made know via Star Trek movies and series of various efforts.<br /><br />We love our hot beverage brewer and have added a higher-end unit to our own home environment.<br /><br />We've used such a device and various coffee and tea pods over the last few years, but this kit tops that experience.<br /><br />I especially like the Hot-Chocolate and Tea beverages apart from the hundreds of coffee options.<br /><br />Do consider buying one of their devices and also sample the so very many flavors of coffees, teas and other hot beverages attached to the brewing station."
3440,3440,3440,3441,5,"I'd never heard of this brand but they were very cheap here on Amazon and I was extremely surprised at how good the Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa is.  Absolutely worth trying, it's really quite good."
3441,3441,3441,3442,3,"This is the best Hot Cocoa I have found so far, BUT I hope I can find better. It's not real chocolately. Wish it were a bit sweeter but on the whole, I would buy it again if I can't find better."
3442,3442,3442,3443,5,This is really great Hot chocolate. The price is right too. Usually I find that hot chocolate k-cups are weak or watery but not this one. I was impressed. The dark chocolate is really yummy! I will be ordering more.
3443,3443,3443,3444,3,"Fortunately, before I purchased I read through enough reviews of these k-cups to discover that they add some artificial sweetener to them along with sugar.  I'm shocked that the item descriptions don't make this clear.  I consider that important information!<br /><br />I decided to give them a try, anyway, considering some reviewers thought it was hard to tell.  I realize that many products do this recently, but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />Sadly, this one does too.  It's close - I can almost enjoy a cup - but it's still unmistakable, especially if you don't consume much artificial sweetener.  (I chew sugar-free gum, and that's it for me.)<br /><br />It's a shame, too, because the chocolate flavor is nice.  In fact, I rated these a 3 simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them.  And I was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before I found out about the sweetener...but now I won't be buying any.  (Side note: many cappuccino reviewers complained that they're instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino - that would be fine with me, if it weren't for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos don't have.)<br /><br />If they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener, I'd buy it, but until then I'm staying away from Grove Square products."
3444,3444,3444,3445,5,"We use our Keurig every day.  When a friend gave us a sample we went crazy, it is the best hot chocolate ever.  I highly recommend this, it is a treat in the evening to take the place of dessert."
3445,3445,3445,3446,1,"I guess there is a reason that the ingredient section on this page doesn't mention that the first ingredient is trans fat (partially hydrogenated oil).  Had I know, I would not have purchased this.  Consumers need to vote with their dollars and avoid buying items where the manufacturer is using cheap and unhealthy ingredients."
3446,3446,3446,3447,1,Please stay away from artificial sweetners.<br /><br />Some of them actually change the shape of human cells.<br /><br />this has an artificial sweetner
3447,3447,3447,3448,1,"I've been excitedly trying every type of K cup I can get my hands on since I got my Keurig for christmas and, until now, have not encountered any that I truly hate. Until I discovered this one. I would have though it pretty difficult to ruin hot chocolate but the people at Grove Square certainly did a good job. Not only was the hot chocolate watery, but it had a horrible plastic aftertaste also. Yuck!"
3448,3448,3448,3449,1,"I ordered this specifically b/c they said ""dark chocolate"" so i was hoping for a rich chocolate flavor. They taste very watery, even using the lowest amount of water on the Keurig. The nutritional fact show that it only has 6 grams of sugar - where the normal store bought powder has 22 grams. I didn't like these at all. If you're going for something low sugar, they might be for you!"
3449,3449,3449,3450,2,"I read all the reviews on every hot chocolate k-cup on the market and decided to try this one first. Its not good. Even on the smallest cup setting it tastes watered down and there is a distinct ""plasticy"" taste. I think that this an inherent problem with all the k-cup hot chocolates. You just can't fit enough chocolate in the cup so that it doesn't taste watered down. I'm going to stick with making hot chocolate the old way."
3450,3450,3450,3451,2,This hot chocolate is ok but not nearly as rich and smooth as the cafe escapes products.  We tried it out because they were less expensive but once they are al gone we'll be going back to the cafe escapes brand.
3451,3451,3451,3452,3,"Just tried this for the first time today.  They are ""ok"", but they do have an odd aftertaste.  Not sure I'll be ordering these again.  Also -- the packaging notes that you need to run a hot water cycle (without a k-cup) after making them (I assume to clean the machine out)."
3452,3452,3452,3453,5,"Compared to other k-cup products, Grove Square offers tasty products at a reasonable price.  This hot cocoa was rich and delicious!"
3453,3453,3453,3454,1,I ORDERED THE DARK HOT COCOA IN HOPES IT WOULD BE REAL CHOCOLATEY AND IT WAS NO BETTER THAN BUYING A POUCH OF HOT CHOCOLATE AND ADDING IT TO HOT WATER. I ACTUALLY THINK THE POUCH ADDED TO HOT WATER IS LOADS BETTER AND A WHOLE LOT CHEAPER!!!! V-E-R-Y ...D-I-A-P-P-O-I-N-T-E-D! FOR THE PRICE...IT'S A RIP-OFF!
3454,3454,3454,3455,2,The Cocoa wasn't too bad. The taste is ok and as good as other hot chocolate mixes.  I was disappointed though when I went to a local store and saw it for less than what I paid just for shipping.  I really thought I was getting a good deal until I went home and checked the ticket.  I just paid three times as much for a box of hot chocolate to be delivered to my house! SO DISAPPPOINTED!!:(
3455,3455,3455,3456,1,this product taste stale and is full of artificial ingredients.<br />NO REAL PEPPERMINT IS IN THIS PRODUCT and to be honest it doesnt even taste like real cocoa is either.
3456,3456,3456,3457,1,"I can't believe I didn't check out the ingredients for this.  I never would have bought it if I would have known there was artificial sweetener in it!  First cup though, I got that weird after taste it gives and that was all she wrote.  If you don't have a problem with a chemical taste or concerns about health problems, you may like it.  Not worth it to us."
3457,3457,3457,3458,2,"Found my kids actually cutting open the pods and dumping them into a cup to add hot water too.  They complained that lots of the good stuff stays in the pod.  Kind of defeats the purpose of the packaging, so we switched back to packets."
3458,3458,3458,3459,5,GREAT! Hot Chocolate! By far the best Kcup hot chocolate I have found. I use a little milk or half and half and it's so..... good. I definitely will order again! Thanks for the super FAST SHIPPING!
3459,3459,3459,3460,5,"My whole family loves this product, often times we struggle to find something like this that we can all have (some members of my family have severe nut allergies).  This product is nut free and clearly states what the ingredients are."
3460,3460,3460,3461,4,"Unlike some others, this is actually IN a K Cup and not just an overpriced version of Swiss Miss.  While the flavor is not super premium like a Godiva or Ghiradhelli, it is better than your average instant mix and much better than the other weak K Cup versions I've had.  The sucralose does give it an aftertaste that reminds me of the sweetness of a commercial cake mix, but it isn't unpleasant.<br /><br />I like to brew this on the smallest setting (4oz) and then add milk to fill the cup and warm it in the microwave, I think that gives a richer taste. The peppermint is my favorite, followed by the dark and then the light chocolate.  They are all very good.  My only wish is that I could buy the peppermint on its own and not in a combo pack only."
3461,3461,3461,3462,4,"These are the only kind of cocoa k-cups I have tried, as I have a fairly new machine. My only complaint is that it seems like the taste of chocolate in the milk chocolate version needs a bit of a boost. However, I usually add another teaspoon of regular cocoa mix and the taste is great. The peppermint and dark chocolate k-cups are delicious. Definitely worth a shot for this great price!"
3462,3462,3462,3463,5,"Whole family liked all three flavors.  We've had some of the other brands of hot chocolates and they were good also but just couldn't get myself to pay that much  for hot  chocolate.  The  price was right on these for sure but I was skeptical after reading reviews on the coffees made by this brand.  But it's just hot chocolate so I figured what the heck.  All three are actually plenty chocolaty on the biggest size serving.  Honestly, I think they're a little bit better than the other brands we've had."
3463,3463,3463,3464,5,What I really like about this selection is the choice of three different hot cocoa chocolates.  My favorite is the mint chocolate for it not only tastes like mint chocolate but it has the aroma of a hot mint chocolate.  The milk chocolate and dark chocolate are equally flavorful as well. The price through Amazon is very reasonable.
3464,3464,3464,3465,5,"Very good hot chocolate.  Nice rich flavor.  We used the smallest setting on our Keurig, and made sure to shake it to make sure the powder was loose in the K-cup. The K-cup was completely empty after brewing. There is sucralose in it, but I could not detect the aftertaste of it.  I'm pretty sensitive to that aftertaste. I will buy this product again.<br /><br />Here are facts on the box:<br /><br />Calories 60, Fat (Saturated)2g, Sodium 220mg, Carbs 11g, Fiber &lt;1g, Sugars 6g, Protein 1g (if it's not listed it is 0)<br /><br />The ingredients list for this is:<br />Sugar, Glucose Syrup Solid, Cocoa (Processed with Alkali) Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (may contain Coconut, Soybean, Sunflower, Palm and/or Canola), Nonfat Dry Milk, Modified Whey, Maltodextrin, Salt, Natural and Artificial Flavors, Cellulose Gum, Sodium Caseinate, Cornstarch, Lactose, Dipotassium Phosphate,Sucralose, Mono- And DiGlycerides, Silicone Dioxide, Silicon Dioxide, Soy Lecithin, Artificial Color.

3465,3465,3465,3466,4,The price is wonderful! The Hot cocoa tastes great in 6 and 8 oz but 10oz was a bit watery to me.<br />Dark Chocolate: YUM<br />Milk Chocolate: Is very yummy<br />Peppermint: For me wasn't enough peppermint but I just add a candy cane to mine.<br />  I would recommend this again and plan on ordering more soon!
3466,3466,3466,3467,1,We prefer the Swiss Miss brand K-cup.  This one was watery in both milk and dark chocolate. This is my least favorite of all k-cup brands.
3467,3467,3467,3468,1,"Nice price, and glad to see a subscribe & save option on k-cups. However this was undrinkable in our opinion. Didn't seem to be too watery like another reviewer said, just a bad off taste."
3468,3468,3468,3469,3,I think the hot cocoa taste great but my wife thinks it is watery. My wife is a big Swiss Miss drinker and knows her hot cocoa. Not sure I will buy again because of the cost of paying for the k cups. Sometimes I think you are better off buying Swiss Miss packets and just use the hot water function on the k cup machine.
3469,3469,3469,3470,4,"Unlike the other hot chocolate(s), this one does not have that obnoxious after taste.  What a relief.  When I purchased my Keurig it came with a box of 16 hot chocolate K-Cups (name not used to protect the guilty), that have the most indescribable, particularly unpleasant after taste, all due to the ""fake"" sugar that seems to comprise most if not all of the product.<br /><br />This manufacturer does use some sucralose, but no where near the amount that ""other"" uses.  In fact, it actually tastes like hot chocolate during and after the sipping.  WhooHoo!!!!<br /><br />Will be ordering more - Thank You for my Kuerig hot chocolate reaffirmation."
3470,3470,3470,3471,5,What a fun winter treat!  This is a perfect cup of cocoa in seconds!  We like to put a tablespoon or two of heavy whipping cream in the bottom of mug before brewing! A family favorite.
3471,3471,3471,3472,5,"Was skeptical about the quality of hot chocolate from a K cup but Grove Square is amazing.  It is just as good as making it from scratch but without the fuss.  The milk chocolate is mild, the dark has enough bite to make it interesting and the peppermint is perfect for after dinner."
3472,3472,3472,3473,5,"I love these! The price is VERY good...all the flavors are really good! The peppermint one is my favorite and I would gladly take more of that before the others. Though the others aren't lacking at all, I'm just a peppermint fan! Will be buying more when my others get low! Thanks so much!"
3473,3473,3473,3474,5,"I like this hot cocoa very much it has a very rich taste compared to the others I have tried.Just bought some more of these.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q1VI"">Grove Square Single Serve Hot Cocoa Cups, Milk, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count</a>A+++!!!!cocoa!"
3474,3474,3474,3475,5,I was skeptical about buying this because all of the other hot cocoa items I've purchased for the Keurig have been awful. I was pleasantly pleased with this!  It is simply delicious!  I will definitely reorder!
3475,3475,3475,3476,4,This is a really great K-cup cocoa. I had been drinking the Cafe Express but they have really gone up lately so this is a good buy . Nice creamy chocolate flavor so I switched to this. I found it at Walmart but this price is better  here for the 3 pack. Give it a try :)
3476,3476,3476,3477,5,"For those who do not drink coffee, this is a great compliment to the teas and ciders also available for your Keurig."
3477,3477,3477,3478,5,Super good price and the best k cup cocoa we have found.<br /><br />I am glad I found this for our family before the big cocoa season hits !<br /><br />love it
3478,3478,3478,3479,3,"I didn't expect much from powdered cocoa in a cup, but here's a tip: put on 8oz setting, then add a 1:1 ratio of heated milk. It tastes amazingly good!<br /><br />Of course if you add a little Baileys Irish Cream, it tastes even better."
3479,3479,3479,3480,5,"we have bought several types, brands of hot cocoa k cups. These our definitely one of the best! They have a great flavor and everyone in my house liked them, even my 9 year old who only likes some hot cocoa loved this. It is creamy, it actually tasted like a melted candy bar, very good taste, not watered down like some of them. Of course the price is amazing, but don't let that fool you! This is one of those products that is actually good even though it isn't very expensive."
3480,3480,3480,3481,5,"Wow, I did a lot of reading trying to make a good decision on a K-cup hot chocolate, and of course taste is something that is very subjective.  If you read all the reviews on every product you'll discover that nothing gets past everyone and maintains a perfectly spotless reputation.  So I decided that even with some bad reviews I'd try this one since it has a lot of good reviews.  I'm just going to say that there are some real hot chocolate connoisseurs writing reviews in this thread.  Some discerning reviewers say it has a slight taste of sugar substitute, or some such thing.  All I can tell you is I must have under-achieving taste buds because all I can taste is yummy hot chocolate.  My family burned through the first box and I just ordered two more.  If you don't like this I feel sorry for you. Better to have numb taste buds I guess.  Enjoy."
3481,3481,3481,3482,5,"When I got my Keurig brewer last month, I bought two different types of hot chocolate.  The Grove Square Hot Chocolate is far superior.  I have so far brewed it on 6oz and 8oz with good flavor at both sizes.  The flavor is rich and it leaves no residue in the bottom of the kcup (the other brand does, maybe I got a bad batch?).  Overall, I will happily buy this one again."
3482,3482,3482,3483,5,I got these cocoa cups based on my sister-in-law's recommendation.  It has a great flavor and is inexpensive.  Quite a good combination.  I'll be ordering more very soon.
3483,3483,3483,3484,5,This is excellent hot chocolate for those of you that love love hot chocolate- go for it - you will love it to... I would purchase this again.
3484,3484,3484,3485,4,"I've tried all the available brands and flavors of hot cocoa for the Keurig, and this is the only one I keep buying more of when I run out. Of course it's not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk, but I find it at least as tasty as any non-K-cup cocoa mix I've had. It is richer than the same company's milk-chocolate cocoa (which would, however, be my #2 pick of K-cup cocoas).<br /><br />One star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup, there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the K-cup, which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum-strength cocoa. Shaking the K-cup first to break up large chunks of powder as recommended on the package seems to help some."
3485,3485,3485,3486,5,I love the flavor and the speed of this cocoa I drink one at night and each is the same good stuff.
3486,3486,3486,3487,5,I am very pleased with this selection.  I have not tried the other hot cocoa brands for Keurig but this one is awesome!  I bought the milk chocolate.
3487,3487,3487,3488,2,"Thought I'd try these because it's a good price, but the chocolate flavor is not that good. And the sucralose taste is very strong. I like the Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate ones better, even though those have sucralose too, you can't really taste it."
3488,3488,3488,3489,5,"Lets face it, $11 isn't going to get you the most succulent chocolate in the world.  But it does give you a GREAT everyday cocoa in a 6oz brew. Great to mix with a coffee for an instant mocha, and no sugar needed!  Kids will LOVE it. VERY happy with this purchase.  Will keep this in my pantry always!"
3489,3489,3489,3490,5,"I have searched for hot chocolate for my Keurig, but couldn't find any that were economical to purchase. I found this at a decent price, and was I glad!  My husband absolutely loves this hot chocolate and says it reminds him of his childhood. Try it - you'll like it!"
3490,3490,3490,3491,5,"My brother owns a Keurig one cup coffee maker, which is an amazing device. I, however, don't drink coffee. When I came across these Hot Cocoa K-cups, I took a chance. They're incredibly good, and it gives me a chance to share a hot drink with the coffee crowd without having to boil water or milk. This 24-pack is priced well against the coffee K-cups as well."
3491,3491,3491,3492,1,"I have never tasted such a poor excuse for a cocoa drink. It has such a bad aftertaste that I checked the box to see if I ordered sugarfree by mistake! I will toss this  and chalk it up to a loss but if you are reading this, dont buy this brand. Its downright awful!"
3492,3492,3492,3493,2,We bought both brands to try and found this one with much less chocolate taste then Cafe Escapes dark chocolate.  It was also thinner in consistency. Won't buy again
3493,3493,3493,3494,4,"I ordered this because so many people were saying that it was sugar free. It's not. The first ingredient is ""SUGAR"". It's too much of a pain to return, so I'll keep it and drink it (because it's a pretty good K-cup hot chocolate). I will think twice about ordering it again though. I'd really like to get what I ordered."
3494,3494,3494,3495,2,"We bought this to replace our Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate Cocoa.  They are less expensive- but you get what you pay for.  This cocoa is watery brown sugar water with an aftertaste.  I do not recommend it.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q1T0"">Grove Square Hot Cocoa Cups, Dark,Single Serve Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>"
3495,3495,3495,3496,1,"I love hot chocolate and was very excited to find a variety pack, however, these are gross.  Horrible after taste, my kids dont even like them.  Now I have 3 boxes of the stuff that no one will drink.  Very disapointed."
3496,3496,3496,3497,1,"I was very excited to get some hot chocolate cups for my Keurig and even happier there was a variety pack.  I read the reviews and even there were some negative ones, I went with it anyways.<br />I tried the milk chocolate.  It has such a weird taste to it.  But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night.  Same weird aftertaste.  I asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds weren't off. He commented that it had a ""hot plastic-y"" aftertaste to it.  Not even worth drinking.  Too bad I have 34 more cups that will go to waste."
3497,3497,3497,3498,5,"Best K-cup hot cocoa on the market, bar none. Would not be without it in the house, especially with the winter months coming."
3498,3498,3498,3499,1,"As a hot chocolate lover, I was verrrrry disappointed when I tried this product. I first had the peppermint (disgusting) and then tried the dark chocolate (a little better). The problem is that you can REALLY taste the artifical sweetener. I am a diet soda drinker, so I don't have a problem with artifical sweetener. It's just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste. I definitely will NOT buy again.... I would not recommend these to anyone."
3499,3499,3499,3500,2,"I'm an avid hot chocolate drinker, and this is just doesn't measure up.  It reminds me of the sugar free Swiss Miss.  No matter what size you set your cup on, it's just missing that cocoa flavor.  Maybe the dark chocolate would be better.  I personally like the Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate better!<br /><br />I bought a 24 pack, and then I was able to find it at my local grocery store, so I bought another one.  Now, I'm stuck with the 24 pack."
3500,3500,3500,3501,4,This is a very mild hot cocoa.  Perfect for those winter evenings or even good in the morning instead of coffee.  We love it anytime.  Next time I will try the dark chocolate.
3501,3501,3501,3502,1,"taste nothing like how cocoa should taste, i'll never touch this again, i'll be trying the swiss miss cocoa maybe better luck"
3502,3502,3502,3503,5,"This is very good hot chocolate, creamy and tasty.  All of the flavors are good, my favorite is the peppermint.  I wish the peppermint was available on its own, not in the variety pack.  My son and I also like to add peppermint flavored marshmallows, for an extra shot of peppermint taste.  In my opinion, better than the Swiss Miss K-cups."
3503,3503,3503,3504,4,"The hot cocoa does have a sugar substitute in it, but as far as I could tell, wasn't strong enough to leave that bitter aftertaste you get when they put a lot of it in the ingredients. If you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little, but it doesn't take away from the taste of the cocoa, so as far as I'm concerned it wasn't an issue. I would say this is on par with the type of cocoa you'd get in a coffee machine, which is fine, because I don't hate coffee machine cocoa. I have only tried the peppermint so far, and it tasted like peppermint... what can I say? That's what it's supposed to taste like."
3504,3504,3504,3505,5,"We enjoy a cup of hot chocolate with our Keurig machine and used to have Cafe Escapes as our favorite.  When I saw the Grove Square brand at such a great price, I thought I'd give it a try.  We love it - it is now our favorite brand.  I will be back for more!"
3505,3505,3505,3506,5,"Had never heard of this brand before, however the price was right for ordering.  Turns out the family likes this better than the Swiss Miss K-cups we had been using.  Will continue to buy, will continue to use.  Don't forget to buy the mini-marshmallows at the store!"
3506,3506,3506,3507,5,My Husband said it tastes wonderful!! Just like you would get in a restaurant....creamy and flavorful! Hightly Recommends this product!
3507,3507,3507,3508,3,"This has artificial sweetener just like the other hot chocolates out there. If anyone knows of one that does not have it, please let me know! It definitely isn't very strong, but I coulod handle it if it didn't have the artificial sweetener aftertaste."
3508,3508,3508,3509,5,This hot chocolate is very good and flavorful. Compared to other hot chocolate that we have tried it is cheaper and we would recommend.
3509,3509,3509,3510,3,"Everyone has their own preferences, I know -- I actually liked the flavor, but my wife tried it and couldn't stand how sweet it was.  To each his/her own, I guess.  But, now that I'VE had a second cup, I tend to agree -- very sweet."
3510,3510,3510,3511,3,I bought this becaue they were $9.99 for the 24 pack.  I could try them for .50/cup.  Other in the store were almost $1/cup.  Overall they are ok/good but you need to run a hot water flush throuhg you maschine afetr each use or there is a potential to have the residue gunk up you drain area.
3511,3511,3511,3512,4,"This is a great assortment and price...I only give it 4 stars because the peppermint is very weak in peppermint, so I add extract. Nice cocoa flavor to all, tho. Reminds me of ""homemade"""

It didn't, so i'm just using Swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig."
3516,3516,3516,3517,1,"If anyone knows of one that does not have it, please let me know! It definitely isn't very strong, but I coulod handle it if it didn't have the artificial sweetener aftertaste.This has artificial sweetener (sucorse)  just like the other hot chocolates out there."
3517,3517,3517,3518,1,"I enjoyed these k-cups when I used them. They tasted pretty good. However, I quickly noticed that my Keurig brewer began to have problems after I started using these and other Grove Square k-cups. Even when I would brew other cups, I would get half-brewed cups of coffee, smaller cups, and other issues. I cleaned the brewer, following all the instructions and tips in the manual. The issues came up again as soon as I used these k-cups. What I discovered is that the Grove Square k-cups were gunking up my brewer badly. I had to clean out every part of the brewer completely, including the brewer basket area, the water reservoir, and the internal mechanism. After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal. I won't order any Grove Square products again."
3518,3518,3518,3519,4,"I'm really baffled by the great differences of opinion on this product. I've tried a couple of different brands and the Grove Square was without doubt the best. I recently purchased a cup of hot cocoa at a local Joe Muggs (in a local BAM store) that was over $2  for the smallest size and really couldn't tell much difference. Obviously every person has different tastes and opinions but so many 1 and 5 star ratings for the exact same product? Oh well, I like it.<br />p.s. 11-27  I like this cocoa well enough that I have subscribed to momthly delivery with free shipping and reduced cost!"
3519,3519,3519,3520,2,"This hot chocolate tastes like hot sugar water with a pinch of coco in it. Although, even the sugary taste is weak, and tainted by the flavor of the artificial sweetener sucralose. The consistency is watery and bland. This is when I made the 8oz cup as directed by the directions on the box.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product."
3520,3520,3520,3521,5,The price was as fantastic as the taste. So convenient to make and no messy powder  that is hard to dissolve. No major cleanup to deal with either. Highly recommended!
3521,3521,3521,3522,5,The kids like cocoa. Perfect when you can't make the kids hot choco. Tastes good too. 24 Count? not bad...
3522,3522,3522,3523,5,Grove Square hot chocolate is very tasty.  I was searching for The Swiss Miss brand and the search pulled up this one. The price was right so I ordered some with hopeful expectations and was pleasantly surprised at Grove Squares wonderful chocolate creamy taste even on the large cup Koerig setting. You won't be disapointed
3523,3523,3523,3524,5,"I love a cup of Hot Choc. in the cold winter months. We live in Penna. and it gets quite chilly here. The Hot Coc. is a little sweet for my taste, but I've gotten used to it and enjoy a cup once in a while"
3524,3524,3524,3525,5,My daughter says this is the very best hot chocolate she has ever had! And I love it because no more spilled envelope messes!
3525,3525,3525,3526,5,I finally found a hot cocoa for the keurig that isn't too sweet. I made a cup the day it came in the mail and from the first sip I was hooked. From now on this will be the only hot cocoa I drink.
3526,3526,3526,3527,5,My grandson and husband love to bond drinking this hot chocolate together. I get it every other month.  I can't ever be without it.
3527,3527,3527,3528,2,I thought the Grove hot chocolate is to sweet. It also has an off taste. I would not recommend this to anybody
3528,3528,3528,3529,4,"In my trip through the health area of my local food market I stumbled upon Enjoy Life Boom Choco Boom Dark Chocolate Bar. I just can't resist trying things such as this. Into the cart it went. It's rather good. It says it's dairy, nut and soy free, and I'll take their word. The question is taste. Well, it's a good tasting bar. I have a couple others that I would regard higher. but this one is quite good. It's a bit high in calories (170 per bar) but has no cholesterol or sodium. Not bad. I'll pick it up again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
3529,3529,3529,3530,5,"I've ordered most of the cheaper Tea's Etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor AND value. I cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ3ZUA"">Takeya Airtight Drink Maker Pitcher / Jug, Set of Two</a> and it works wonderfully. (Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)<br /><br />I'm glad I ordered this when I did, the price has more than doubled! I'd still say it's a GREAT value. This is my go to tea when I want something with a little more flavor than ""regular"" black tea. I don't sweeten my tea, but I think this would be a perfect sweet tea for a hot day. The orange flavor is very palatable unlike some others. It's noticeable without being pungent or artificial. It also isn't spiced like many other orange teas."
3530,3530,3530,3531,5,"Arrived nicely packaged and sealed. An aromatic, lovely tea that I love to blend with others to make custom iced tea blends. I love this Oolong orange with fruity black teas. Recommended!"
3531,3531,3531,3532,5,"That is right, open the bag and just get your nose close and smell it. You know this is a quality product instantly. Some of the tastiest tea I have had and the Oolong and orange are a great mix. Even if you aren't a tea drinker at all, once you smell this tea you will want to try it. I am very glad I bought this product it is a favorite of mine."
3532,3532,3532,3533,1,I bought this to include in my daughter's party bag - It worked so well with the circus theme that we had.  Unfortunately the cracker jacks were stale.  When I heard this the first time I thought no way can't be but then someone else told me the same thing and then I heard it again from someone else.  Really disappointing.  I am so embarrassed.
3533,3533,3533,3534,5,"So fun and great price. This was one of our party favors at my son's birthday party. HUGE hit! I will buy again for the baseball team and group outings. The box is just like the good ol' days, although I remember the prizes were better back then (or maybe my expectations were lower since I was 10)."
3534,3534,3534,3535,1,Arrives $15.06 postage due in a used Friendly 's box. UNFRIENDLY don't you think? Worst service ever!!!!!_Totally unfriendly! !!!aweful aweful aweful service!

3536,3536,3536,3537,1,Ordered this and most of the boxes were stale and stuck together.<br /><br />Checked the expiration date and it wasn't expired.<br /><br />Starting to think they just changed the expiration date and shipped everything that went bad.
3537,3537,3537,3538,5,We bought 2 cases of these. Expire date was 3 months out. Plenty of time to eat. We have 2 boys and got these for them as a snack in lunches etc. I was worried that the product would be stale as stated in other reviews. We've ate 3 boxes and all were fine so far. Kids loved it and I did as well. Prizes were not as good as they used to be but they didn't know the difference. A few were educational and that never hurts! We'll probably order another couple cases. At 40 cents per snack you can't go wrong!
3538,3538,3538,3539,5,Bought these to give out as party favors for my son's baseball themed birthday party.  They were a huge hit with both the adults and children.
3539,3539,3539,3540,3,Product was older then I would purchase if I knew what the date on the individual boxes was before purchase. It gives me only one month to eat them all before being outdated.
3540,3540,3540,3541,1,"I don't know the deal is here but they are terrible.  I love Cracker Jacks and not just cause there is a prize, especially now that the prizes are pointless compared to what you use to get.<br /><br />These arrived and the first box I ate seemed very stale, checked the date and was not expired and the date was a long ways away so I figured maybe it was that box.  But I'm a few boxes in now and they are all the same it's like chewing on cardboard.  I event went to the local 7-11 to get some to compare and those at 7-11 were 1000 timex better.<br /><br />Since it was so cheap to get them it's not worth the hassle to send them back so I think I'll just give them out for halloween."
3541,3541,3541,3542,1,"Cracker Jacks were horrible--stale, not crunchy and tasted awful even though the expiration date on the package had not expired"
3542,3542,3542,3543,5,"I threw my son a baseball themed party for his 1st birthday. What would baseball be without popcorn, peanuts &get crackerjack?! Item was delivered as promised & the packaging was old school, which was appreciated by parents, granparents &the even great grandparents! Item was fresh & taste great!"
3543,3543,3543,3544,5,I ordered this product for a themed baby shower. They went over well and they tasted just like normal cracker jacks. Loved that I could find the box and they fit perfect in favor bags.
3544,3544,3544,3545,3,"I purchased cases of these for our company picnic. The boxes were cute, the idea of it all was a big hit. But the ""gift inside"" was a bust. I would gladly have paid more for a stupid little item rather than the ""writings on paper,"" or whatever they were. What is Cracker Jack without the gift inside? I find it to be misleading that they call it ""Original.""  Original had the gift inside."
3545,3545,3545,3546,2,"Becareful if you plan to use these more then two months after you order them, they expire quick. I can't use these, I ordered them to use in my November wedding but they expire in March :("
3546,3546,3546,3547,4,"If you're looking for a healthier alternative to peanut butter (whatever reason) this is a good choice.  It's nice and crunchy, tastes better than other brands I've tried, and doesn't separate as much as others.  Best I've found so far."
3547,3547,3547,3548,5,"I love these noodles.  They are really great for a midnight snack.  It's not really something that will fill you up for a dinner.  If you do eat it for dinner, you will be hungry later.  Maybe some people wouldn't!!!!  But, it just doesn't stick to my ribs.  I love them though and Amazon has a really good price."
3548,3548,3548,3549,5,"This soup cooks up quickly and is very yummy! I really like the flavor of the seasoning packet and the way the noodles cook up, nice texture. It is very satisfying to me. I'm a single gal who doesn't really cook & am often in a hurry for my next meal, and I find that this soup really hits the spot. Although it does tend to be more of a mid-afternoon snack/light lunch item for me. It will tide you over for a while until your next big meal, but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hours.<br /><br />Personally I LOOOVE this soup that much more because I had to give up the ramen cup o' noodle and some other brands i had been eating because I developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks.  It seems that often these instant noodle packets/bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish. This one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do. Another plus for me is that it's not spicy. I'm kind of a wimp with spicy foods, plus i have GERD/reflux, so believe me if i can eat it is NOT spicy. Just tasty :)<br /><br />One thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable (in my town they only take 1's and 2's which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of.) Oh well, can't have it all...."
3549,3549,3549,3550,4,"Somehow I feel healtier eating these things instead of peanuts. I don't know why either. Also, unlike peanuts, I can limit my intake to a handful and not the whole bag."
3550,3550,3550,3551,5,"I have tried all of these nuts and they are fantastic.  I highly recommend them as a snack which is not only healthy, but tasty.  The mulberries combined with chocolate are amazing."
3551,3551,3551,3552,5,A suprisingly delightful snack! Great to have around while I'm working long hours in front of the computer.
3552,3552,3552,3553,3,"I really liked this flavor!  As someone with many food sensitivities who also avoids sugar, this is the perfect treat for me when I crave chocolate or baked goods.  The raw nuts are crisp and fresh tasting.  However, the price was very high for the quantity of product.  With less than 20 brazil nuts in the package, I felt a little gipped.  In future, I'll try making my own chocolate nut mix from bulk raw nuts, berries, and coco powder rather than spend $9 per package!  For that price, I'd like a lot more product."
3553,3553,3553,3554,5,a great deal. it arrived with no damage. the taste to me is the best. i have tried most other brands and really got fed up with them. they just don't taste right to me. but this one i can eat right out of the bottle and enjoy it. it tastes so good. i am very happy with this purchase and the price is great also.
3554,3554,3554,3555,5,I prefer jerky with a dry texture but always have a hard time finding a good one.  They're usually moistened soft chunks of meat instead of hard strips.  If you like old-school jerky then I highly recommend this product.  Delicious!
3555,3555,3555,3556,5,"recommended to me by a friend i saw at the gym - had seen them a few times at the fatted calf in napa, but didnt really pay attention.  i will never buy beans in the bag from the grocery store again.  huge difference in taste and quality.  sent my son who is an aspiring chef and gourmet foodie a box of beans in a bag as well..."
3556,3556,3556,3557,5,"I've probably tried about 15 varieties of beans from Rancho Gordo.  They're all excellent.  Some are better suited for one type dish than another, and if you visit their website, they will tell you what works best for which dish.<br /><br />Some are just plain gorgeous to boot!  And being heirloom, I believe you can also save some back to plant, if you have the climate for growing them.  (Unfortunately, I don't.)<br /><br />Out of all the ones I've tried, we like the Borlotti best - they cook up plump and will hold their shape, with a creamy interior.  They're fantastic for Mexican-style beans - frijoles borrachos, refried, whatever you like.  And I've also cooked them with ham hocks/garlic/onions etc. for a delightful bowl of beans.<br /><br />This particular assortment doesn't have the Borlotti beans but you could always add them to your order!  It's a nice sampler and will get you hooked on their products.<br /><br />Oh yeah, sign up for their newsletter too, Steve sends out a good one with recipes and stories of the beans."
3557,3557,3557,3558,5,"I had no idea what this stuff was when it was served to me at a restaurant recently - and I could not stop eating it! Finally figured out it was Kalamata Olive tapanade, and I wondered where the heck can I get this stuff? I'm totally spoiled now! Well, I headed for where I always go when I want the best of everything - amazon.com! And there it was, and now I can have it whenever I want! I love tossing a bit with pasta, particularly the tomato and basil pasta I also order from amazon; it's great on salads, on humus sandwiches, and anything else you can think of once you get the taste in your mind hehe. It's fantabulous!<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTI4TM"">Peloponnese Kalamata Olive Spread, 7.5-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>"
3558,3558,3558,3559,5,I got this for a gift for my father and he loved them.  I will probably get them again but only as a gift due to the cost of sausages.
3559,3559,3559,3560,4,I know -- the description is clear enough about apples & cranberries but I found these sausages to be a little too sweet.  My guests agreed.  The same company makes sausages that I like better.
3560,3560,3560,3561,1,"Original description and order said ""Assorted"" chocolates. What I got--weeks (!) later--was one pack of all white chocolates (the least desirable). Not worth the bother of returning even with Prime. Might be better just buying at local store (same or cheaper price) when you can see what you get."
3561,3561,3561,3562,1,These look like typical sugar plum jellies but they are actually grape flavored. You would assume that they would have a sugar plum flavor. They taste like cheap Kool-Aid and not the yummy Jelly Belly ones I can't seem to find on Amazon.
3562,3562,3562,3563,3,"These arrived fresh and in a timely manner.  However, flavor-wise our family is in agreement that Jelly Belly produces a richer plum flavor, slightly larger sugar plum in size, and a bit softer in texture for their sugar plums.  The price on the Albanese sugar plums is reasonable, the flavor is good and it's always nice to support a small, independent candymaker!"
3563,3563,3563,3564,5,"This coffee is really rich, perfect in the morning. I ordered it for the office, but it was going fast. After a day or so I decided it was too good/fine to share so I swapped it out w/some cheap stuff and brought it home. More for me!"
3564,3564,3564,3565,5,"This canned organic corn is great. Sweet and plump, and being organic is added bonus. Inside, the can lining looks JUST LIKE Eden's BPA free cans, but so far I can't find the consumer service number of the company to verify if their can is BPA free. At least I don't see the white plastic lining in these cans. I'm just hoping these are BPA free, then these are totally awesome!"
3565,3565,3565,3566,5,"Found this item quite good: it was sweet and slightly crunchy. All in all, a delightful product. It arrived in excellent condition, no dents and no dings. Perhaps the packaging has improved."
3566,3566,3566,3567,3,"PERHAPS AMAZON SHOULD START A SCRATCH AND DENT SECTION AND SELL ITEMS LIKE THIS CORN THERE! ALL BUT ONE CAN OF THIS GREAT TASTING CORN WAS DENTED, SEVERELY! DONT GET ME WRONG, I WILL STILL BUY DENTED GOODS, BUT ONLY AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE. THE DAMAGE DID NOT OCCUR IN TRANSIT EITHER WHICH DISTURBS ME. IF THEY KNOW THEY ARE SELLING DENTED CANS, FINE, BUT START A SCRATCH AND DENT SECTION!!!!!!"
3567,3567,3567,3568,5,"very good corn product, we will be eating this case of corn way faster than we expected.  It was well packed and stores in the pantry nicely"
3568,3568,3568,3569,3,"The fresh tasting Libby's Organic Corn, no additives! I can't believe Amazon can offer such good tasting corn in a can so cheap! But for taste and value, this can't be beat."
3569,3569,3569,3570,5,I combine this with Libby's Organic Black Beans and Libby's Organic Green Beans mixed with Bob's Red Mill Organic Brown Rice at least two or three times per week for a perfect meal every time!
3570,3570,3570,3571,5,"We live in an area that does not have a lot of stores that carry organic at reasonable prices. That said I found the product to be a good value and convenient not to have to sometimes wait for local stores to restock, if they even stocked.<br /><br />Yes, some cans get dented in transit but it really was not a big problem for me. I hope the future delivery is the same or better.<br /><br />It is unknown if the can lining is BPA free. I try to avoid it but until the manufactures get it out it's near impossible to buy canned goods that don't have BPA in the can lining. Pregnant women should avoid anything with BPA in it and if I had growing children I would also strive to avoid."
3571,3571,3571,3572,1,"they decided to ship both my order in ONE HUGE box of 24 cans instead of 12 green beans in one box, 12 corn in another and i was barely able to get this inside my house.  then every single can of green beans was dented and 3 cans of corn were dented"
3572,3572,3572,3573,5,"I ordered from east coast supplier before and even when shipped with a bag of frozen water the dark chocolate coating turned very light. I live on the west coast and this seller is in CA, so I got the Snickers in just a couple of days, instead of 10.<br />And their shipping costs were less, they shipped via post for under $5, instead of via UPS.<br />Lowest price I have paid for this candy and best quality."
3573,3573,3573,3574,5,These tic tacs are great right up there with the orange flavor. I did find them cheaper at the 99cent store 49cents a pack. I went recently and bought 24 for $12 heads up for anyone living in Ca.
3574,3574,3574,3575,3,"This was a very good price for bulk ordering. However my order was part of some gift bags we were putting together for 8th graders. There was never intent to resell these. Due to ordering limitations, I was unable to order all 300 packs from here."
3575,3575,3575,3576,5,"I first encountered this flavor at an airport magazine stand.  I sampled a couple and was hooked.  I thought this flavor was the best of all in the TicTac line.  On my flight, I was munching on the pack absent-mindedly.  I landed with the idea of buying several packs.  Then came the rude surprise - Grapefruit flavor is not a common sight on TicTac stands - anywhere.<br /><br />I finally settled on this purchase as the only way to maintain a steady supply.  This flavor of TicTac is best used as a ""chaser"", following a heavy-duty breath freshening from TicTac Power Mint, the blue color.  Not only is Power Mint effective, it also numbs out my tongue for several minutes.  A follow-up with a single Grapefruit restores my mouth to normality.<br /><br />I rate Grapefruit as the best flavor, with Watermelon and the new Strawberry Foelds close seconds.  In general any flavor TicTac is effective breath-freshening, but Grapefruit is truly addicting.  TicTac settles the issue that the tongue is a major contributor to sour breath."
3576,3576,3576,3577,5,"Delicious and unique flavor, great for those who like a little tart taste. Nice the have a 12 pack since they are pretty hard to find."
3577,3577,3577,3578,5,"When I stumbled across pink grapefruit tic tacs, I was intrigued enough to order them.  I do enjoy grapefruit flavors and I love tic tacs with intense flavors.  These did not disappoint.  They offer an intense flavor that tastes just like real grapefruit.<br /><br />An unusual treat!"
3578,3578,3578,3579,5,"Look no futher. Always fresh! Nothing is worse than stale candy,, so save yourself from anguish and purchase here today"
3579,3579,3579,3580,5,"My daughter and I loved these when they first came out but had been unable to find them locally.  Then I thought, if anyone would have them, Amazon would!<br /><br />So glad to find them - it made a nice addition to her Christmas stocking."
3580,3580,3580,3581,5,"We found these pink grapefruit Tic Tacs while vacationing in Massachusettes; when we returned to California, we couldn't find them! I was happy to find them here. They taste great!"
3581,3581,3581,3582,5,This is a keeper flavor -- hope Tic Tac removes pink grapefruit from the limited edition category.  Citrus flavor seems especially potent to freshen your mouth after eating onion/garlic.
3582,3582,3582,3583,5,"I rarely eat anything but whole wheat pasta, but every once in a while, I eat some of this as a treat.  Almost as good as the pastas that I ate while in Italy!  Just make sure you don't over cook."
3583,3583,3583,3584,5,"I love The Meadow.  So I guess this review is more about how much I adore this store, than it is about the salt (which by the way is fabulous).  I got my order way faster than I expected, which was nice.  I would recommend purchasing anything from these amazing folks, and even better if you can visit their lovely store in Portland.  This is one of the most romantic stores that exists.  Opening my box of truffle salt, and smelling that fragrant scent, was just not as magical as walking into their gorgeous store filled with flowers, salt, chocolate and wine.  Ah, it is a taste of heaven.<br /><br />The salt's great.  thanks Meadow people."
3584,3584,3584,3585,1,"The purchase and receipt of the box of chocolates was very good, and made my home in plenty of time for Christmas.  The box was opened the day after new years.  The cholocates were discolored and dry.  The box had expired two months before I made the order.  I made a complaint with Amazon which was resolved in a few days with full credit to my charge card.  This company wanted me to mail them back the chocolates which i had saved along with the wrapper.  They would not reply back to my inquiry as to who would pay for the shipping the chocolates back to the seller. I still have the out of date and bad box of cholocate and will keep them for inspection for the next month or so.  Then trash can."
3585,3585,3585,3586,5,"A very soft, very delicious Keebler Brand Cookie that is hard to find in the supermarket and generally around $4.49/bag 'cause it's never on sale. I picked up my order of 6 bags through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon for $13.00, a good bargain considering how much they are in a grocery store @ $4.49/bag and hard to find usually in this variety! If the sale is right, I highly recommend it for you to try and buy for yourself!"
3586,3586,3586,3587,5,It is hard to stay out of these wonderful cookies! Just the right amount of chocolate chips and the texture is melt-in-your-mouth good!
3587,3587,3587,3588,5,"I may be dating myself here a bit but I remember when the first Soft Batch cookies came out.  These were the first and they were bigger and yes, even softer than these are now.  But, at that time, they were the ONLY soft, prepackaged cookie (can you believe that?) besides Archway.  They then came out with at least a dozen other varieties but for some reason, they stopped making them.  I can remember every kid imaginable going nuts over these things so I'm wondering why they stopped.<br /><br />Anyway, back to today, these cookies, even though they're smaller, are still quite excellent.  They are just so soft and taste better than Keebler's other soft and chewy cookies.  This package made it about 20 minutes in this house - that's what happens when you're raising a bunch of Titan boys!<br /><br />Great, great stuff, HIGHLY recommend!"
3588,3588,3588,3589,4,"Chewy Chips Ahoy and Keebler Soft Batch are very similar taste and texture. I decided to try this since a had a coupon for 50% off. They're slightly smaller than Chips Ahoy, but that's about it. My cookies arrived a little crumbled due to shipping, but no complaints because they were still edible and tasted great. Great Cookies, and now I have a stockpile of them :)."
3589,3589,3589,3590,2,What more can I say. Barley Edible - Crunch on Sugar.  Did come on time but have a feeling that they wanted this unloaded because it didn't sell or maybe bad batch.  Doesn't make you sick or anything like that but you can actually find yourself crunching on sugar like you put a sugar cube in your mouth.  Kids probably don't care.  Hope this helps.
3590,3590,3590,3591,5,"Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.  As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.  This seemed a bit odd, but there were 2 sheets of wax paper, I guess to prevent dust, etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom.  Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy!"
3591,3591,3591,3592,3,"I was shocked to see that the bulk version of these Jelly Belly's are just in a cardboard box, no plastic, no nothing. Doesn't seem overly hygienic. Since I didn't open the box for a few months the Jelly Belly's were getting softer and crystallizing [unbeknownst to me] because we live in a wet climate. Hmmm...just be aware that the packaging should be upgraded"
3592,3592,3592,3593,5,I don't understand why this dog food is not full of reviews. Checkout [&#8230;] they give this dog food 4 out of 5 stars which beats science diet and purina one which I use to use and diamond natural is less expensive.
3593,3593,3593,3594,5,"We purchase this food for our two boxers and great dane. The dane has an allergy to chicken and one of the boxers has a weak stomach, so this food is perfect for them. All three dogs love it (even the picky one) and it seems to agree with their digestive tracts more than any other dog food that we've tried (I can't begin to tell you how pleased I am about THAT). I did a lot of research to find a quality food that isn't full of filler and won't break the bank. I am 100% pleased with this food, more so than any of the other more expensive brands that I've tried."
3594,3594,3594,3595,5,"I have tried many many many different brands. I also did my research on what's the best for my Dane and most of it is expensive. I found this to be very good quality and a good price among Chicken Soup and Canidae.<br />My GD loves this he eats 7-8 cups a day and he would love to eat more. He has a shiny coat, no allergies and his sensitive stomach thanks the food. I highly recommend this. But I am buying it somewhere else a little cheaper and 2 day shipping. ;)"
3595,3595,3595,3596,5,"Over 90% of dry dog food is very unhealthy and can not even get 1 or 2 stars out of 5 or 6. Diamond Naturals is a great food. I have 6 Afghans and I've spent many, many hours of research to find this out."
3596,3596,3596,3597,4,"My giant Schnauzer was weaned on this food. When we changed to Blue Buffalo, Eukanauba  Lamb and Rice, and Nutro he developers allergies. This is the only food that works."
3597,3597,3597,3598,5,"It's amazing how little popularity that Diamond Pet Foods seems to have considering the quality ingredients their foods contain!  I worked at a pet store for about four years. Our number one recommendations on foods were Natural Balance and Wellness- two EXCEPTIONAL foods that are pretty expensive.  But for those owners who have multiple dogs or even one large breed dog, those brands can cripple your budget.  So when I would get customers who absolutely LOVED their pets and wanted to be able to feed them healthy food without breaking their banks, I recommended Diamond.  Diamond dog food costs about the same as those commercial brands like Purina and Iams, but contains ONLY natural, healthy ingredients.  Just remember, the less garbage you feed your dog (by-products, fillers) the less your dog uses the bathroom- AND they stay fuller, longer!"
3598,3598,3598,3599,5,"This is the best dog food I have ever purchased, and having been a dog training for over 4 years, I've purchased A LOT! We first tried this food when our new addition (an 8-week old German Shepherd) joined the family, and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food. With any purebred dog, health can be an issue, and you don't want to fill your dog with by-products and plant fillers from day one. This food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers, and I don't understand why there isn't more publicity for this product. Our other dog, a 5-year old English Bulldog with constant skin/allergy issues, was switched over when we discovered this brand, and she has not had an allergic reaction since! We didn't realize how much it had to do with diet. Her hair used to fall out in spring (not just normal shedding, but actual balding from hair loss), but this has alleviated that problem as well. Now our shepherd is a year and a half old, and he's eating this Large Breed Adult Lamb & Rice flavor. He's not a big eater, but he loves this food! Will definitely keep him, and all future pets, on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now!! Kudos Diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I would never buy regular Diamond brand food. If the bag doesn't say ""Natural"" on it, the standards they are kept to are WAY lower and the quality suffers immensely. Stick with Natural (it's a couple dollars more at most!) and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life! Isn't that what we all want?!?"
3599,3599,3599,3600,5,"I don't review much, but I have been buying this brand for my Irish Wolfhound for over 2 years now.  He still loves it and it's good for him.  If you have a large breed dog, this dog food will be a good choice for healthy food."
3600,3600,3600,3601,5,"this food gets an A rating compared to failing scores for many others in the price range. however, it's about $8 more here on amazon than at the local pet store (after a 9.25% sales tax)"
3601,3601,3601,3602,5,My 8 year old Great Dane was itching a lot with the Lamb meal from the big box stores. I started buying this (for cheaper) and he stopped itching. His coat is also looking shinier. I wish I would have discovered this years ago. It saves me trips to the pet store and money also.
3602,3602,3602,3603,5,"I ordered two of these bags for my three dogs - a mastiff, a lab, and a terrier mutt.  They arrived well packaged inside cardboard boxes.  The dogs like the food, their coats are shiny, and the mastiff didn't vomit when beginning this new food.  He has problems when switching foods, but he started on the Diamond Naturals with no problems.  I'm going to continue to buy this food for my dogs."
3603,3603,3603,3604,5,"I have 3 dogs with different needs and tastes and this is one of the few foods that meets them and basically one of the only ones I can afford.<br />My oldest (14) loves the lamb, my husky loves the glucosamine and the youngest farts less on this food which makes everyone happy.<br />I always try to find food with good ingredients and this meets that standard while staying one of the cheapest foods. I thoroughly recommend it!"
3604,3604,3604,3605,5,"This salad seasoning is so simple but extremely tasty.  It enhances the salad as it's not too over-powering.  It's a salty, mildly seasoned packet of goodness. It's also very addictive probably due to the MSG. Add olive oil and red wine vinegar, Mmmmmm.  I can't believe I found it here, b/c you cannot find it in mainstream supermarkets nor ethnic markets anymore."
3605,3605,3605,3606,5,"I have used this product for a few years now, my family and I love how it adds flavor to our salads and frozen vegetable dishes. Problem was I could only get it at a few grocery stores when I would go home to Florida to visit, then I couldn't find it at those stores anymore. I was happy to find it on Amazon and ordered the case quantity which will last a long time."
3606,3606,3606,3607,5,"I loooove this product .... I use it a lot on my salads, vegetables  and to season meats ..... delicious !!!"
3607,3607,3607,3608,5,"I love Goya salad and vegetable seasoning, I tried it once and was hooked, it's the only thing I use on my salads now. I love the small packages, I can easily take them to a restaurant. I also love the fact that it is much lower in calories than regular salad dressing.Thankfully,the area that I live in carried this product for a short time and I was able to try it. Unfortunately the area that I live in stopped carrying the product, I know this because I searched every store in the town that I live in as well as the surrounding towns. Eventually, I went to Amazon and found the product, unfortunately at that time they are out of stock, I waited six months and finally Amazon had the product again. I ended up buying the pack of 24 eight count boxes, to make sure that I never ran out of the product again. Since I had so many I was able to share with friends and family."
3608,3608,3608,3609,5,"This is a simple salad seasoning, just add vinegar and oil one packet of Goya<br />salad seasoning and you will have the best salad ever.  Also you can put in<br />a potato salad and is marvelous also!<br />please give it a try and enjoy it!!!"
3609,3609,3609,3610,5,"My husband refuses to eat fish, but he LOVES this. It only takes 10-12 minutes to make, and is way better than any other kind of Tuna Helper I've tried.<br /><br />Besides the box itself, you'll need:<br /><br /> - 1 can of tuna (6 oz., or I use 8 oz.)<br /> - 1 tablespoon of butter<br /> - 1 cup of milk<br /><br />It's a breeze to prepare, just DON'T leave it alone before you put the tuna and pasta in. Because of the milk, it likes to boil over. Just keep an eye on it and reduce the heat right after it starts boiling."
3610,3610,3610,3611,1,"The box has only pasta and dried-up sauce. No TUNA!!!<br /><br />If you can see the words in the spoon on the bottom right of the box, it says, ""Just add tuna"".<br /><br />So the products is making a FALSE CLAIM !!! Shame on you, Annie."
3611,3611,3611,3612,5,Mackerel is a tasty alternative to salmon with nearly the same Omega 3 content. My local grocery store hasn't been able to get tinned mackerel for several months. No one can explain why. So I ordered a case of these and have been pleased with the quality and value. I'm reordering.
3612,3612,3612,3613,5,"i have ordered mackerel several times on amazon and most pleased with SEASONS brand than any other. seems to me the fish are smaller therefore less mercury.<br />packed in olive oil is also a bonus. they are not as ""fishy"" as others that i have tried. i eat them to get a healthy serving of omega 3. my 11 year old boy has taken a liking for them as well as my 14 year old daughter. we put a small chunk on a cracker and top with a ring of hot banana peppers.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDMW9M"">Season Fillets of Mackerel in Olive Oil, 4.375-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> i would recommend this brand. tom heflin"
3613,3613,3613,3614,5,I ordered these a while back off of Amazon. The mild flavor and firm texture is great. When they are available here they are about 2/3's the cost of my local super market. They are always good no matter where I buy them. I just wish Amazon kept them in stock all the time.
3614,3614,3614,3615,5,The product was exactly as I expected and the same as previously bought in retail stores.
3615,3615,3615,3616,5,"At  $3.33 a can, these are expensive for what they are, but are well worth it. The mackerel are of very high quality, are well packed, and not overcoooked or smoked. Also, since fish is the only meat I eat, I end up having a can almost every day."
3616,3616,3616,3617,5,"These are better than the usual canned fish filets, tastier, and not dry.  There are no bones or skins.  I worried about Mackerel but they are much nicer than, say, kippered herring filets or sardines in oil.  It's easy to pour off the olive oil if that is a worry, but you'd be losing something that is also tasty."
3617,3617,3617,3618,4,"They taste good and give you a lot for what you pay. The meat was of high quality. I was however expecting each tin to contain one medium sized fillet. Rather, these are about 6 small fillet in a can, much more like sardines are packaged (but these are just fillets). Was a bit disappointing for that, and the info could have been more clear."
3618,3618,3618,3619,5,Ordered 2 cases on different dates and got them within 2 days. Cant find these in the stores so please keep them in stock. Make for a great meal with some veggies or a salad...and this type of fish with omega 3's is good for you.
3619,3619,3619,3620,5,"These are wonderful!  Exactly like the originals, only in miniature form.  Delicious and crispy and the wonderful Amaretto flavor!  Rapid shipping from the seller as well!"
3620,3620,3620,3621,5,This has been a Christmas favorite since my late sister-in-law introduced our family to these cookies over 20 years ago.  She was from Italy and loved these cookies as do we.
3621,3621,3621,3622,5,"This product makes a great gift!  Not only are the cookies delicious, but the tin is attractive and of good quality.  Highly recommended."
3622,3622,3622,3623,5,"When I was in Rome I got these for my grandfather as a gift, he is from Italy so I thought he would enjoy something from home (although I wasn't sure if these were a little Americanized, since a lot of the wording on the tin was in English). Anyway, my grandfather LOVED them. My mom thought they were too sweet, but he just loved them and now I am glad I could find them online so I can get him more!"
3623,3623,3623,3624,5,"A little more money than your average cookie, but VERY much worth it.  You will not find a cookie like this anywhere else!"
3624,3624,3624,3625,5,We had candied chestnuts that came in a box in France many years ago and have since looked for them in the states.  This year I searched the internet and wa-la there were some products to try.  There were some products more expensive and because the product would be shipped we did not want to be spending a lot for something not that good.  These came in a can with syrup which was different than the ones we had had in France but they are excellent.
3625,3625,3625,3626,5,The best way to get Jelly Belly... a good price.. and you only get the flavor you want.
3626,3626,3626,3627,1,"Instead of a resealable tub with the jelly beans, I received a cardboard box, with a plastic bag full of jelly beans.  They were closed with a twist tie and there was no labeling on the bag.  On the box there was a typed label that said:""green apple jelly  belly 16 oz. new"".  There was no ingredient list, company logo, allergen information, or anything else you'd expect to find on food packages. I certainly wouldn't eat food that arrived in a plastic bag with a twist tie.  I did ask that it be shipped next day, so maybe they couldn't take the time to package it in the advertised tub.  Amazon was nice enough to give me a full refund, which was the only positive part of the experience."
3627,3627,3627,3628,5,Chocolate with coconut!  How can you lose?<br /><br />I love Ross Chocolates.  You can really tell that they are made of top quality chocolate.  It is creamy and flavorful.<br /><br />I enjoy these (and I buy several flavors...all have the same great quality and taste) especially because I try to keep my sugar intake to a minimum.  I keep a supply of them in my refrigerator in airtight containers at all times.  They keep very nicely.
3628,3628,3628,3629,4,"Very nice product.  It is not a Mounds bar, but it helps satisfy the urge."
3629,3629,3629,3630,2,"I wait for this cereal to go on sale before I buy it and the sale price is usually $1.99 per 12 ounce box.  The regular price is about $4.<br /><br />$28.88 for 70 small boxes of less than one ounce each is 41 cents per box/nearly per ounce. The sale price is 17 cents per ounce.  The regular price is 33 cents per ounce.<br /><br />On the other hand, this should make two rice krispie treats with one box.  Starbucks sells rice krispie treats for $2 as one of their lowest priced snacks."
3630,3630,3630,3631,4,"DE is a very good coffee.  I ordered this as my father-in-law raved about it, and the whole bean aroma rood is indeed a good coffee.  It tastes like a medium coffee with a particular spice feel to it.  Very unique and very tasty.  I tend to make my coffee very bold even if it is a 'medium' coffee, and even bold this is up there with some of my favorite coffees.<br /><br />If you are a coffee fan, this is worth a shot, pun intended.<br /><br />Enjoy."
3631,3631,3631,3632,5,"I drank this coffee over 30 years ago when I lived in The Netherlands. So glad that I can get it through Amazon. Strong, full bodied but easy on the tummy!!!"
3632,3632,3632,3633,5,"If you have a coffee grinder, this is the best coffee, I would highly recommend it! The taste and aroma remind me of sitting in a cafe in Holland, relaxing and watching the passersby..."
3633,3633,3633,3634,4,"This is a very good, medium-roast, medium-bodied coffee. Brew it directly after grinding the bean to capture the most flavor."
3634,3634,3634,3635,5,this product came as advertized..it was a great buy and I love the taste of the tea<br /><br />great deal and happy i purchase from them.
3635,3635,3635,3636,2,"I bought this for fathers day. My father loves dried fruits and nuts.<br /><br />It came in a somewhat cute crate box, and each compartment was in a plastic bag. That means that if you don't eat the nuts in one sitting they will go stale, as they are now sitting in the open. Same story for the fruit.<br /><br />While all the bags were closed when my father opened them he found that the nuts were stale and the fruit were hard/chewy.<br /><br />I recommend purchasing this if you need a centerpiece, but not if you actually want to eat it."
3636,3636,3636,3637,3,"I paid extra money to have this overnighted to my sister, and it turns out it arrived more than a day late. That's unacceptable to me."
3637,3637,3637,3638,5,I used this flour in my usual pizza recipe. I noticed the difference with regular bread flour right away. The dough was very elastic and easy to work with. The pizza ended up being lighter and crispier than usual. I will only use his flour from now on!
3638,3638,3638,3639,5,Shipping was prompt and the product was what I fully expected.  It helped me be successful with Mama Agata's Lemon Cake where U.S. flours failed.
3639,3639,3639,3640,5,"I don't know why this flour isn't available in grocery stores in the Midwest.  Typical grocer flours have a protein content much too high to give an authentic taste to such foods as pizza crust and homemade pastas.  And after years of making homemade pastas and trying to find that perfect recipe that would result in those served in the best Italian restaurants in the US and Europe, I'm happy to discover, the secret was in the 00 protein content all along.  What a fabulous difference this flour makes!  Freezes well too."
3640,3640,3640,3641,5,"So this stuff is a must have for making true pizza napoletana.  I'm really thrilled that it is so accessible here in the USA.  This flour makes the most silky smooth dough I've ever had the pleasure of getting sticky with, and it has a different (better for pizza) taste than the all-purpose store brand flour.  Sure It costs a little more, it's coming from Italy, but given that you can make about 6 pizzas per bag ... who's counting?  Get this stuff, some D.O.P. tomatoes, grow some basil, and make some Mozarella (okay, I admit, haven't done this one ... yet) but given the first couple items there and you're well on your way to the origins of pizza in Naples, Italy. Is it worth it??? I say Si!!! Mangia!!! (And Taylor's Market always comes through for my home shipments!... Cheers!)"
3641,3641,3641,3642,5,"I ordered this Italian flour after reading an article about some of the issues with American wheat. It is<br />light, and everything I've made with it from cookies to pizza crust has been delicious. It was shipped<br />very quickly."
3642,3642,3642,3643,5,"If you follow their recipes precisely, with careful measurements, the freezer jams are excellent.  Strawberry jam is particularly appealing.  I've been warned that changing quantities of any ingredient will not have happy results."
3643,3643,3643,3644,5,"sweet, juicy and yummy. I have to try hard not to eat too much at one time. So addictive. It tastes just like those in Asian market. Actually this one tastes a bit better."
3644,3644,3644,3645,5,"Dried mangoes are my hubby's favorite fruit.  He especially LOVES the Philippine brand.  Some come close, but no cigar.  We have searched high & low to find a brand comparative to these, but there are none.  Having them delivered on a regular basis is great & with free shipping.  No more detective work and disappointment.  He does have to be careful however, because he seems to eat them too fast & runs out short of the next delivery, maybe I will increase my quantity!  Quality is the best.  Delivery on a regular basis was a perfect gift for him.  I am very happy & satisfied."
3645,3645,3645,3646,5,"Great value and much superior to what you find in stores. Makes a great snack or after dinner treat, but for those who are health conscious remember to keep it to a few pieces since they are covered in thin sugar. Try to keep the bag tightly sealed once you open them since the slowly begin to dry up. Will be ordering more soon :)"
3646,3646,3646,3647,5,By faar the best dried mangoes i have purchased. Fresh and full of flavor. The 2 pach 20oz is probably the best value. Order a lot because it will be done before you know it. Trust me it is heartbreaking when you reach into the bag and only find mango crumbs.
3647,3647,3647,3648,4,"I remember really loving to eat dried mangos when I was younger so I decided to give this brand a try. These weren't bad per se but they were a little too sweet for my taste. I guess it's a good thing though since you don't want to eat a lot of them because the calories will build up unless you control your portions. I'll eat one and it'd satisfy my sweet tooth for hours before I want to eat another one. Therefore, I guess it's a good thing that it's a little too sweet but still... I would have liked less sugar."
3648,3648,3648,3649,1,This is not a 20 oz bag.  It is only 4oz each bag.  Misleading product.  Thought I was buying 20oz bags.  Not very happy.  Should've gone local for 8 dollars per bag.
3649,3649,3649,3650,3,"I love these delicious mangoes but the subscription option doesn't ship at correct times. I just received two shipments at once (even packaged in the same box) this week, when one of those shipments was supposed to be for April and I was not notified of that before they shipped and charged my card."
3650,3650,3650,3651,4,"Tasty, slightly different flavors then other brands, but good. In all other respects good purchase. Hard to find in US so I am not too picky."
3651,3651,3651,3652,5,This sauce is excellent for authentic Chinese dishes! My wife is from China and we love to use this product to make Hot Pot and Ma Po Tofu.
3652,3652,3652,3653,4,"Bought this as a joke to give to a friend that is a beer connisseur (sp) for his dog.  The dog didn't really care one way or the other and tried to give some to my dog and he also turned up his nose.  Not sure, but it appears to have a very salty, brothy smell that could be the reason for the turned up doggy noses.  However, it was cute to put into staged pictures of the dogs with the plastic bottles looking like they were hung over, along with their master!"
3653,3653,3653,3654,4,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and his roomates' dogs. It looked really cute in the package but left the dogs exremely gassy. They are a german shepard, pitbull and a retreiver at fairly large sizes but it was a little rough on the tummy so use lightly."
3654,3654,3654,3655,5,"I use this for iced tea and it is just so much better than American teas - it just plain is!  It is all I buy, and now I get it for others too.  Look no further."
3655,3655,3655,3656,5,"I'm a big black tea drinker and have tried a lot of different brands out there, and I find that PG makes the best black tea. It's nice and strong, not like crappy Lipton black tea. We've been loyal to the PG brand black tea for over a year now - it's a little pricier than other brands, but definitely worth it if you enjoy black tea."
3656,3656,3656,3657,5,I find it is difficult to find black tea in the United States that is of decent quality.  I love PG Tips.  It brews up nice and rich and is reasonably priced.
3657,3657,3657,3658,5,I really love this tea and have found that my daughter and daughter-in-law feel the same!  I've used the loose leaf tea for years but find the convenience of the bags encouraging.
3658,3658,3658,3659,5,"Love this tea...especially love triangle bags more flavor & the tea is what I remember it to be...Happy<br />Came right on time in great shape...Happily enjoying my PG TIPS!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5JLE"">PG Tips Black Tea, Pyramid Tea Bags, 240-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>"
3659,3659,3659,3660,5,"Love PG Tips tea.  It's hard to find in the USA, but a standard in the UK."
3660,3660,3660,3661,2,"I have to say that I really wanted to like these muffins, but I could not.  They have a really bitter after taste.  Whether this is attributable to the gluten free nature of the product, I do not know.  The Hodgson Mill Blueberry Muffin Mix is a far better choice.  On a positive note, they do raise very nicely, but it is unfortunate that I find them barely edible and have five more boxes of the mix left."
3661,3661,3661,3662,5,I baked my first batch of these muffins and was pleased that they were so easy to make and tasted so good.  Then I stored them in the refrigerator since gluten free home baked goods are notorious for molding.  I ate one straight out of the frig and it was great!  I guess the flavors melded together after being stored a few hours.  I finished the batch one at a time out of the frig without re-heating any of them.  They were so good that way I couldn't bring myself to try them any other way.  :)<br /><br />Our family has been navigating the area of gluten free eating for over 10 years.  The choices just keep getting better as more companies are becoming aware of celiac disease.  I have created an astore through Amazon that has the gluten free items we have had the pleasure of trying. [...]
3662,3662,3662,3663,1,"I really wanted these to taste good, but there is something in there that is very bitter. I had to add too much sugar to make them even slightly palatable. No one would eat them. They LOOKED delicious after baking and they're healthy, but that's only if you manage to choke one down. I have tried their gingerbread, corn muffin mix, and jalapeno cornbread mix and those are all great."
3663,3663,3663,3664,5,If people would read the ingredients they would be less critical of the end product.  I only tried them as pancakes and they lent themselves most excellently. I used an Erythritol instead of sugar and they tated great and cooked very well.  I did not even use a blender to mix.
3664,3664,3664,3665,3,"This item didn't have the pleasant taste that most of Hodgson Mills products have, such as the Wild Blueberry Muffin Mix.  However, I found it greatly improved the flavor & added nutrition if I grated an apple into the mix. It increased the much needed moisture, & it was certainly a nutritious breakfast."
3665,3665,3665,3666,1,"This product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent Gluten free as well as non-gluten free baking products. DO NOT let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. This mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested Gluten free product. It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market, you find yourself constantly adding ""something"" to try to make it right. To these, I had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste. I added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix. THIS mix takes too much ""Doctoring"" to be recommended at all until Hodgson Mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this. BUT, Hodgson Mill does have other good products. Try their Blueberry Muffin Mix and hope that one day Amazon will carry a wider array of their Gluten Free offerings as many are very, very good."
3666,3666,3666,3667,2,"These came out smaller than I expected, but the taste as not as good as I thought it should be.  Second time, I added a couple of items, which helped a little, but it is hard to find a great tasting boxed muffin mix.  I thought it would save me time, but I like my own muffins better.  My husband thought they were okay, but not great."
3667,3667,3667,3668,5,"I couldn't get these to work for muffins, so I decided to try the pancakes and wasn't disappointed. They come out perfectly raised every time. I like to make these without any sugar in the batter. The flax makes it very bitter, but I like them like that with lots of butter. However, if you just add some syrup on top, it extinguishes the bitter taste on contact. Give these a try!"
3668,3668,3668,3669,1,"I have never prepared anything so disgusting.  The taste was a mix of sour milk and cardboard, the smell just as bad.  I had to take the trash out because the whole room was beginning to smell.  I bake often, so I know it's not a kitchen error and I'm not that picky, but I could not stop gagging. I would recommend Pamela's brownies--add extra dark chocolate and they're delicious as ""brownie bite"" cookies (side recipe on the bag).  I even make them super healthy and use 1/2C applesause instead of oil!"
3669,3669,3669,3670,2,I bought these at my local grocery store. I wish I would have read the review on here first. The positive is they do hold together well and look like a muffin. The negative is they are so bitter. I could barely finish my half. I just recently found out I have Celiac Disease  so I cant have gluten. I have never tried a gluten free muffin mix before so I can not compare it to any others. I have tried the Betty Crocker Gluten Free brownie mix and that is wonderful. So I do believe there would be a good muffin mix out there.
3670,3670,3670,3671,4,"These muffins will not win any prizes for flavor.  I agree with other reviewers that the aftertaste is somewhat bitter and compared to (at least what I remember of) real muffins with sugar, gluten, eggs, butter, and that other good stuff they are quite fine.<br /><br />I do not eat gluten, derivatives of sugar cane, eggs, soy, dairy, corn . . . I could go on but you get the idea.  In order to use this mix I had to make substitutions and was delighted with what tastes like a treat to me.  Aside from the fact that I don't have to measure out three kinds of flour to make something from scratch, the best thing about these muffins is the texture.  Texture is a challenge absent gluten, sugar, and eggs, and I found this to be very much like how I remember muffins.  The bits of dried apple make these chewy and kind of weirdly so.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with my purchase."
3671,3671,3671,3672,5,"I have 2 children with food allergies, so I have to use egg, milk and butter substitutions for these muffins, and it works well.  I add a little more sugar to the mix and top the muffins with a brown sugar and pecan mixture before I bake them.  All my kids love them!  You can top with just brown sugar if you cannot have or do not like pecans.  I love these muffins as well!"
3672,3672,3672,3673,4,"Folks who are comparing this to Hodgson's blueberry muffin mix obviously don't require gluten-free products (since the blueberry are whole wheat muffins). If, like me, you require gluten free, this is a great product. This is the first flavorful GF baked good I have stumbled upon. Very simple and quick to make. Like all GF products, they are pretty dense in the end, but the apples make for a nice addition and they fill you up. Personally, I added a bit more ""sugar"" (xylitol) than the recipe calls for. Next batch, I will also add some fresh apples and extra cinnamon. My only complaint is that you get so little out of the box (makes 6 small muffins)."
3673,3673,3673,3674,1,"I was really excited and surprised when I found this mix in my local Wal Mart. Given it was a good price, I figured Id give it a shot.... before I whipped up a batch I figured Id do a little investigating to see if there was any input/ suggestions on the mix. WOW. Is everyone using the same mix or what? Reviews from ""its great"" to ""its horrible""..like a total 50/50 split. SOOOooo, before  I wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself, I figured Id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix, all on its own.... ummmmm, yeah. It TOTALLY has a pretty strong bitter after taste. :/ And , like another reviewer, I had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener (I dont like things very sweet, at all) but its DEF not. As I re read the ingredients I realized there isnt ANY sugar/sweetener in this mix so, youd def NEED to add sweetening. But, overall, I dont even plan on taking this mix that far. Im pretty certain that adding sugar wont take that aftertaste away. Thats an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away..... Id strongly suggest avoiding this mix.... I hope the company works on this mix. It has good elements to it (I like the fact you can determine how sweet youd want it and the apple pieces are pretty tasty) and I think it COULD be really tasty."
3674,3674,3674,3675,1,"If I could, I would give it zero stars.  I am not a picky eater, but this mix did not rise (can you say hockey puck), was extremely bitter, and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added.  Save your money."
3675,3675,3675,3676,5,"These muffins were very good made according to the recipe on the box, but when I changed the recipe a little, by substituting almond milk for the 2% milk, and extra virgin olive oil for the butter, they were great!  Next time, I am going to try adding some grated carrots and not adding the sugar.  Thank you Hodgson Mill for a wonderful gluten free product."
3676,3676,3676,3677,1,"I bought this because I have celiac disease and was really craving some muffins.  I am not a health nut, I just can't eat gluten.  With that said, this is nasty.  It calls for very little sugar, I figure for the health nuts, so I simply added more sugar since it said to sweeten to taste.  Even with extra sugar, it leaves an extremely bitter taste in your mouth.  I would rather pass on muffins than ever taste something like this again.  On a positive note, the muffins do stay together and look like muffins and if you try the product and dislike it, you can mail in the bottom of the box and your purchase price for a refund."
3677,3677,3677,3678,2,"I concur with previous reviewers in that these muffins have such a bitter taste! I also bake often and I'm certain it wasn't me. My gluten-eating husband didn't like them either. They were also dense.<br />If you are looking for an apple cinnamon flavor and need a mix, you might be better off using Pamela's Baking Mix (which is awesome!) and adding apples and cinnamon to it. The muffin recipe is on the back of the Pamela bag.<br />In conclusion, I don't recommend these; they were really disappointing."
3678,3678,3678,3679,4,"My family really liked these muffins.  I also made them while on vacation at my sister's house, and her family loved them.  I just got back from a Bible study full of pretty picky eaters, and they all said they were good.  They're usually pretty honest about how the gluten-free food I take tastes, even telling me once that some store-bought cookies I took tasted like cardboard.<br /><br />I did notice a VERY SLIGHT bitter aftertaste, but it was not too bad.  I think next time I make these I may take the advice of one other reviewer and add a grated apple for that extra touch.  Oh, and I only added 3 TBS of sugar and think they were really good, as did everyone else who ate them.  I'm sure that if you add even more sugar, the slight aftertaste could disappear altogether.<br /><br />I just went to the Hodgson Mills website and saw that they did recently change the formulation to this mix, so maybe that improved the aftertaste.  This mix does not have garbanzo flour.  They use sorghum instead, now.  I did not make these as muffins.  I found that one box is perfect for 2 mini loaves, which I prefer to muffins.  Very good.  I will continue to make these when I need something fast and don't have time to make it from scratch.<br /><br />Oh, and to the poster who asked about gluten free pasta, Tinkyada makes a great brown rice pasta."
3679,3679,3679,3680,5,"I recently discovered that I have sensitivities to dairy and wheat, so I have been trying gluten free products.  I knew about Hodgson Mill because of their Oat Bran hot cereal, which is really good and soothes my tummy.  Consequently, I ordered Hodgson Mill gluten free pancake and waffle mix, as well as their apple cinnamon muffin mix.  Both have proven delicious.  Even my husband, who is not gluten sensitive, loves the pancakes.  I made waffles from the apple cinnamon mix this morning, and they were really good and very filling.  Not sure if the formulation has changed since the previous negative reviews, but I have no complaints, and I am very picky.  I just wish Hodgson Mill products were more readily available in our local stores.  If anyone has tried their gluten-free pasta, please post because Lundberg's rice pasta left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Thanks!"
3680,3680,3680,3681,5,Woeber's Hot & Spicy Mustard is oh so good!  I'll buy another case when this gone.  Makes a great gift as well!
3681,3681,3681,3682,5,It is great! I like it alot. Great price too. I think it is delicious. Top quality product in my opinion.
3682,3682,3682,3683,5,"This is a nice mustard for sandwiches, potato salad, corned beef, roast beef or hot dogs.  I have yet to find a single Woeber product that I do not like.  They are all tasty.  I am glad to see that their distribution range has grown over the past ten years."
3683,3683,3683,3684,5,I started giving these to my daughter when she was 9 months.  She loved them so much her first word was cracker (while signing more)!  They dissolve in her mouth so I don't have to worry about choking.  And they are healthy too.  I highly recommend it.
3684,3684,3684,3685,5,We have to hide these boxes and pull them out when our one year-old daughter won't eat anything else.  She will always eat these.  Her brother and sister are always sneaking and eating them too.
3685,3685,3685,3686,5,My little girl will ask for these crackers day and night.  Bought a pkg of 6 and have used up 4 real quick.  I will be back for more very soon.
3686,3686,3686,3687,5,"I LOVE these graham sticks.  They dissolve well and are super yummy (yes, I have eaten quite a few of them:).  I think they taste better than any other graham cracker I've tried, and they're organic to boot.  As far as sugary snacks go, they have pretty healthy ingredients. I like pretty much everything I've tried from Earth's best.  For those of you interested in how they're sweetened they contain organic invert syrup, organic evaporated can juice, and organic honey.  They don't have anything ""scary"" in them like maltodextrin or other such sweeteners.  Just vitamins and natural, organic products."
3687,3687,3687,3688,5,And they are good for them! With whole wheat flower and no high fructose corn syrup like a lot of other crackers.
3688,3688,3688,3689,5,My 1 year old loves these! Great snack! I've tried to find these at my stores and can't seem to get them very often. Love that they are organic and my one year old loves that Elmo is on the box!
3689,3689,3689,3690,5,"I love these snacks because they are whole grain and organic. I also love the fact that they do not spill everywhere out of the snack cup like cheerios. I have also noticed that they do not leave a lot of crumbs, which makes Mommy happy."
3690,3690,3690,3691,4,"I bought these for my  grandbabies because they are earths best and organic. They like them,but not as well as the cinnamon ones. I tried them,thought they tasted kind of like dirt."
3691,3691,3691,3692,5,Bought these for my grandbabies and they love them. I love them because they are organic. Only the best for my little guys. My big guys even snack on them.
3692,3692,3692,3693,1,"I bought these graham sticks based on their excellent reviews and having purchased Earth's Best organic vanilla cookies, had high hopes for a healthy snack to serve my kids.  Needless to say, I should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to 6 boxes through Amazon (which you are unable to return -even unopened boxes- since this is a food item).  The crackers smelled strange even before tasting them.  My 5 year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few.  I wish I could describe the taste, but it would be really hard.  It may sound strange for an organic food, but it was almost like a faint chemical smell.  At best, I can say that they weren't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste).  My 2 year old did eat some of them without complaint, so I am hoping she will tolerate them through 6 boxes so I feel like I did not waste my money.  Good price, but definitely test one box first to see if you like them."
3693,3693,3693,3694,5,"15 month old loves to eat them on the go! They seem great for a healthy, quick, and easy snack!"
3694,3694,3694,3695,5,My daughter loves these snacks and so does everyone else. I try to feed my daughter organic stuff and I'm so glad that Earth's Best makes a variety of snacks that she can have.
3695,3695,3695,3696,5,This is a very good snack that I feel great about offering my 10 month old.  She can easily  pick up the small pieces and definitely enjoys the apple cinnamon taste.  My 5 year old loves them as well!  I would definitely recommend these to anyone with small (or larger) kids.  :)
3696,3696,3696,3697,5,These are the only organic grahams I can find for a reasonable price.  We LOVE these and Amazon makes them a perfect affordable snack for my toddlers.
3697,3697,3697,3698,5,"These are great crackers.  My little guy likes them a lot and best of all, they don't contain any soy or dairy!"
3698,3698,3698,3699,2,"I really didn't notice Elmo on the package? These are for kids more than adults. Nothing wrong with flavor, but priced for kids that scream alot."
3699,3699,3699,3700,5,"I have a pure breed GSD and had problems for years with upset stomach, eating grass and throwing up bile in the morning and then would not eat as her stomach was too upset.  It finally dawned on me that due to throwing up bile in the am was that the food was not staying with her.  I even tried feeding her before going to bed at night and still did not work.  I tried Evo and I could not believe the change.  She does not get us up at night to go outside.  She was having 3-4 bowel movements every day and now she has 1 or sometimes 2.  I have had her on the Evo large bites for almost a year now and she has not been sick once.  It is the higher protein in this food that stays with her longer and has made all of our lives so much better.  Thank you, thank you EVO!!!"
3700,3700,3700,3701,5,"We have a Golden Retriever and had been feeding him the Wellness dog food.  He ate it begrudgingly so we decided to find something else.  I read the ingredients on the Evo red meat and was really impressed.  I gawked at the price but decided cheaper dog food isn't really a bargain if your dog won't eat it or get any enjoyment out of it.  The first time we fed it to him he pretty much inhaled it- and will literally go sit by the bag and look at it like it might just open if he stares at it hard enough!  I agree with the first reviewer that loose stools are a factor but believe with time that will clear up.  He is just so happy that we will keep on buying it for him, although I wish the price were a little more reasonable."
3701,3701,3701,3702,5,I have been feeding my GSD the red meat formula for about 6 months and all I can say is WOW. Before I started him on this food he had problems with skin allergies and being picky about food. Although the price for this food is a little daunting it is worth the price! You feed about half the amount you normally would since its so nutrient dense so one bag lasts us almost a month where a bag of purina would last us about 2 weeks. His skin allergies also cleared up in about month and his coat has never looked better and the dandruff is gone too. The only down side is when you first switch over it can cause some loose stools-but it gets better once their digestive system gets adjusted. All in all if you can afford to feed them EVO its well worth the investment!
3702,3702,3702,3703,5,"When I got my dog I did a lot of research regarding dog food and dog food ingredients. There are high quality dog foods like this one out there, but you probably won't find them in regular supermarkets. While this food may be more expensive than other dog foods, it is well worth it. Innova Evo is one of the foods that were NOT affected by the recall. Also, the ingredients are healthier, and don't have high wheat/grain content or nasty additives.<br /><br />My Doberman used to have a lot of dandruff and had some skin problems. Also her poop was really mushy, almost diarrhea. When I finally switched her to Innova Evo Red Meat I'd wished I'd done it sooner. She doesn't need to eat quite as much, and her coat is beautiful! No more dandruff problems and her skin is great."
3703,3703,3703,3704,5,We have two Great Danes and it is very hard for us to keep the weight on them.<br /><br />EVO is the first dog food that both of them enjoys.  I dearly enjoy not having to chase them down and make sure that they eat.<br /><br />I have also notice that our older Dane is more active since he has been eating EVO. We feed them a mixture of the Innova EVO Red Meat and Innova EVO Large Bite Dry Dog Food.
3704,3704,3704,3705,5,"I have a 2 1/2 year old 60 pound German wirehair pointer.  We feed this food during hunting season due to his increased metabolic needs.  He burns so many calories, he eats 8 cups of this food a day (with zeal).  We use the large bites to help keep the tarter and plaque off of his teeth (and to slow his eating).  Due to the high quality of this food, he can keep up his energy, keep his weight up, and recover more quickly from scrapes/bumps from running the field.  Our vet's exact words were, ""Your dog is an example of perfect health.""  You may think the price on this food is high, but it is worth it.  You get what you pay for.  Also, consider the canned version of this food.  It is a nice way to feed/hydrate a dog after a long day hunting - just give them an hour to settle down first.  On a side note, we feed Diamond Naturals Beef and Rice in the off season.  We have no digestive issues transitioning from one to the other (we switch over a period of a few weeks)."
3705,3705,3705,3706,5,"Complete, protein-based nutrition.  My dogs love this...although I'm not sure the pibble actually tastes it, she inhales it so fast.  ;)<br /><br />Regarding the other users who have had diarrhea issues:  My gastro-picky GSD (is that a word? I think other GSD owners will understand!) has had this as well.  Initially, I overfed this food, thinking that he needed to be eating the same amount as he had been eating the other stuff.<br />You feed MUCH less of this product.  It is nutrient-dense, and not all filler like other foods.  If you over-feed, you increase the risk of unpleasant side effects.<br /><br />It's a bit pricey, and I haven't broken down the cost per day, but since you feed less it might be competitive with other brands if someone was inclined to ""run the numbers""."
3706,3706,3706,3707,5,My wife switched our dogs to this food about 4 months ago and she has virtually gone from vacuuming daily to once a week.  The dogs hardly shed at all anymore. No more brushing needed and their coats are very soft and shiny.  We have used other grain free foods previously and liked them but this one is definitely the best we have tried.  It's pricey but we are able to feed them 1/2 of what we were using on the other foods and still maintain the same weight.  This food is well worth the price and the dogs love it.
3707,3707,3707,3708,5,"This was a new food for my dog, and he seems to have adjusted very well to this product. Thank you, and I wish there were more coupons available for this item."
3708,3708,3708,3709,5,"My husband and I are not coffee drinkers, but we love hot chocolate. We hated the time it took to heat up the water,and the mess the dry mix sometimes makes. We saw that the Keurig coffee maker did other things like hot chocolate and tea, liked that it was almost instant hot water, and bought one. I ordered another brand of hot chocolate k-cup, and absolutely hated it. It had a weird almost metallic taste that was not sweet or chocolately. I was worried I wasted my money on a maker I would never use. I decided to try another brand and purchased the Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate Cocoa, and we absolutely love it! It is sweet and chocolately without being too bitter(which is why I originally steered away from the dark chocolate). I fully recommend this product!!"
3709,3709,3709,3710,1,"These cups are artifically sweetened with sucralose - I didn't realize until I tried one, and ended up with a little bit of a headache, which made me check the ingredient list - it isn't noted on the front of the box.  They definitely have an artificial taste, I would not buy them again."
3710,3710,3710,3711,3,"I'm dieting, and I use these as a ""treat"" to myself, when I'm craving chocolate.  I usually brew one of these & one of my coffee K-cups (either plain or hazelnut).<br /><br />For 60 calories, it's not a bad way to satisfy a chocolate craving when you're on a ""calorie-budget!"""
3711,3711,3711,3712,5,Even my kids like this. They are always asking for hot cocoa. Its not too sweet and very chocolaty. It is not super high in sugar or calories so its a great little treat. Enjoy!
3712,3712,3712,3713,1,"This Hot cocoa is the nastiest tasting instant cocoa I've ever had. I know it's not going to taste like the real thing, but after just three cups I can't bring myself to finishing the box. I think I'll just throw them out. Our k-cup machine is about a month old and the coffee flavors we've tried are all fine so we wanted to try the cocoa. The first try was very watery so I thought the cup size needs to be reduced. This results in just a sweeter cup of hot water. Stick with coffee."
3713,3713,3713,3714,2,"These have an artificial sweetener aftertaste. Not pleasant. I would not purchase them again. This the first Kcup hot chocolate I've tried, I'll keep looking."
3714,3714,3714,3715,1,This product tastes like muddy water maybe because it is out of date!?!  I don't know but I'll not buy this again.
3715,3715,3715,3716,4,"Good tasting and the pricing is pretty good. It's always sold out on Keurig.com, so I come here to make this purchase, I love Dark Chocolate! Reason for 4 stars, the pricing isn't great but it's okay."
3716,3716,3716,3717,5,This is a wonderful Dark Chocolate flavor.  Much deeper flavor than the Milk Chocolate.  The Milk Chocolate is good but does not have this deep flavor.  Will be buying this again.!!!
3717,3717,3717,3718,5,"The hot chocolate K-Cups don't work like the coffe K-Cups.  The coffee K-Cups have a screen inside the cup to keep the coffee grounds in the K-Cup, it also makes the last drop of liquid to fall into your cup as much coffee as the first drip.  These Cafe Escape Hot Cocoa K-Cups don't have a screen the chocolate powder empties out of the K-Cup as fast as it can, so that the last amount of water to come out of the Keurig is mostly water and it sits on the top of your cup.  So STIR it before drinking it, otherwise all you taste is the sweetener.  Also these K-Cups are made for 8 oz serving size, so use the appropriate cup size for your taste."
3718,3718,3718,3719,2,These were a little disappointing. The hot chocolate is very watery and the flavor is a bit strange...kind of plastic tasting. Haven't been able to find a good brand of hot chocolate for keurig
3719,3719,3719,3720,1,"After trying several of these k-cups, we threw the rest of the box away.  It only ever created flavorless brown water.  We then tried the Grove Square dark chocolate cocoa k-cups, and were much happier."
3720,3720,3720,3721,5,"This seems to be the best brand that I have tried.  Others have been very weak in flavor, but not htis one.  I would truly recommend this for Moms who have small children and need the hot chocolate after playing in the snow.  Grab the marshmellows and enjoy!  Grammie Smith (6 grandkids)"
3721,3721,3721,3722,2,"Sure to be a hit with chalk-a-holics everywhere, from first sip to last this product suggests its European heritage deep in the chalk mines of southern France.<br /><br />Some seem to be making a case for it only having 60 calories, but the Keurig Chai Latte only has 70, and that product actually tastes pretty good.<br /><br />I have yet to find a Keurig-compatible hot chocolate that stands up to plain old Swiss Miss, scooped from a tub or a foil packet. And Swiss Miss isn't that great to begin with, although it sure is cheaper than this stuff.<br /><br />I wonder if the size of the Keurig capsule limits the amount of cocoa and powdered milk that can be put into a cup, so what ends up there has to be strong and highly compromised."
3722,3722,3722,3723,3,This product is not sweet enough for me and tastes better with marshmellows already in the cup while brewing. Watery texture was a disappointment.
3723,3723,3723,3724,5,"This is a much better Hot Chocolate than some of the reviews would have you believe.  My wife does NOT drink coffee (calls it ""Yuck"") and I am very particular about my coffee, BUT we agree that this is an absolutely delightful hot chocolate.  I use a medium cup size setting and it seems to be the best one for this brew.  This chocolate comes in as a not so close second to some of the great hot chocolates we have had while traveling Europe, however this did save us airfare. But this is not at all bad for an instant cup of pleasure.  Adding marshmallows or topping with whipped cream would take it over the top.<br /><br />If you are one of the ones who wants to throw yours away, please send my way.  I will get rid of them for you.  Thanks!)<br /><br />I got this product directly from Keurig as one of my two free when I registered my new brewer and purchased two.  Could not beat that price here, but at normal prices, this is the deal.<br /><br />From the package: 60 Calories, 2g fat, 11g Carbohydrate, 1g Fiber, 7 G sugar, 1g protein.  Ingredients: Sugar, Alkalized Cocoa powder, creamer (and all of those ingredients, etc."
3724,3724,3724,3725,1,"This one has a major problem. It's waaaay too watery, even at the recommended settings. The chocolate flavor is okay, and it's not overly sweet (although it still isn't great dark chocolate flavor). The really issue is that there isn't any creaminess, and adding milk only dilutes the flavor even more. Blech! I'll pass, and I'm throwing the rest of the box out."
3725,3725,3725,3726,1,"Just got a new keurig and immediately went on a search for<br />the best dark rich bold coffee (Caribou Mahogany) and other brands<br />with rich taste (Wolfgang is winning so far) but really wanted to find<br />the best hot cocoas and got these first...now trying to give them away.<br />The are even worse than the packaged kind you get in the stores. Actually,<br />I think I've found better instant ones. I hate to write a bad review but..if<br />you want to find a DELICIOUS cocoa mix in the K-cups...get the Grove (Station) brand<br />here on Amazon.  They are always sold out (which DUH I know why now as they are a far better<br />tasting brand) but if<br />you put your email on a wait list, they'll let you know when they come in and<br />you dont have to wait very long.  I'd stock up though, as you'll find you want a cup<br />or two every night! (and the dark, milk and peppermint combined box is the bomb!!)I just<br />sent a couple boxes out to a friend of mine who was complaining about how bad the k cup hot<br />chocolates were....she'll be thrilled to get my care package!!"
3726,3726,3726,3727,1,Gross! I tried these thinking they would at least taste like the regular powdered mixes.  The flavor is all fake sweetener (odd since sucralose is the last ingredient) and no dark chocolate.  I am bummed because now I have a box of these cups and don't want to drink them.
3727,3727,3727,3728,5,These bites are 'just enough' for a snack. They are delicious and the price is very reasonable! I will definitely purchase from this company again.
3728,3728,3728,3729,5,"I tried this brand first and I must admit I became spoiled because subsequently I went to Whole Foods to try and buy a bunch more. I had to get Navitas and found they were smaller, drier and less flavorful. So here I am -- this brand's golden berries are large, with a wonderful more succulent texture. The only problem is sometimes I get the seeds stuck in my teeth! They have tiny white seeds like raspberries but the berry itself resembles a large golden raisin. The flavor is very strong and captivating -- like a lemon with the tartness strength of a cranberry. Within days of incorporating golden berries into my diet I have noticed my insides are thanking me. Golden berries are naturally very anti-inflammatory. They have an addicting flavor that I will gladly continue to feed into."
3729,3729,3729,3730,5,"Imagine if you made a craisin out of a berry that tasted like a lemon instead of cranberry. These are very tart, which I love. I eat whole lemons so tart is fine by me. These are not super sweet either, which is refreshing."
3730,3730,3730,3731,5,"Both my boys have autism and are on strict GFCF diets.  The foods by ENER G are very good.  These cookies, although rather crumbly, are delicious!<br /><br />My youngest son calls them 'white cookies'.  I am a VERY picky eater - but do enjoy eating a white cookie with him!  You should try them with some chocolate melted on them...oooh divine :)"
3731,3731,3731,3732,5,These cookies are delicious. My grandaughter ate a whole package the first time she tried them. She has several food allergies and finding a delicious sweet treat is almost impossible. I will be reordering soon because she has gone through the whole box already and has requested more. I am so thankful to have found this product.
3732,3732,3732,3733,5,"Slightly crumbly, but overall a very good cookie.  In my opinion very similar to Chips Ahoy but more airy, less dense."
3733,3733,3733,3734,5,"Like a lot of gluten free foods there is a tendancy to crumble, but these arrived in very good condition.  The vanilla flavoring stands out.  Very good for light snacking or dessert."
3734,3734,3734,3735,5,"son is gluten free, but not fun and tasty free, so these are great!!! I put<br />his icecream on these for a COOL snack.  Taste good to him too just plain."
3735,3735,3735,3736,4,"My husband eats GF, and I don't, and its so hard to find him goodies, and hes always tempted to eat mine. Now he has some thing I'm tempted to eat, I thought they were ok cold but if heated up they really taste yummy."
3736,3736,3736,3737,4,"I am addicted to these cookies.  They taste much better than the regular ones.  The only draw back is, that they should be available in smaller packages - to avoid binge eating."
3737,3737,3737,3738,2,"My son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies. The taste is okay. The texture is hard and weird even when microwaved. Short shelf life if you are buying in bulk. Not absolutely terrible but worse than average. Try Pamela's chocolate chip cookies they are wonderful, or try a baking mix."
3738,3738,3738,3739,5,"I read the nine reviews that preceded me and wondered how a product depending on a person's taste could consistently receive five stars.  Is something suspicious here?<br /><br />Nope!  Here's the tenth five-star rating in a row, and I'm tough.  This is the best sauce of its kind (or any kind) I've ever had; and I'm an old guy who's been around.  Just the right sweetness, just the right hotness.  I'd love to soak a chicken in it, as well as dip egg rolls and chicken nuggets.<br /><br />These big bottles won't last and I'll be back for more, fer shure.  Absolutely more than worth worth the little price, this stuff should be standard in every home, along with plumbing.<br /><br />And my sincere apologies to those other reviewers for doubting you."
3739,3739,3739,3740,5,"This stuff is good. My mom gave me a bottle to go with some eggrolls and we were hooked upon first dip. The perfect blend between sweet and spicy, this stuff is so yummy that even people who claim to dislike ""spicy"" or ""Asian"" or any other kind of exotic fare find it delicious!"
3740,3740,3740,3741,5,"This goes down in my Self Proclaimed Condiment Queen Nation as a ""keeper"" I saw it in the asian market i go to for 2.50, a huge bottle, i looked at the ingredients, no preservatives or added colors, good, good, said it went with everything, also good, got it home and WOW, its amazing! Garlic, Hot, Sweet, I am a dippin fool now."
3741,3741,3741,3742,5,And I don't mean just for Asian sauces.  This is easily the best sauce ever!  I put it on everything.  It's gotten out of hand.  I go out of my way to see what else I can have it with.  My latest thing is pouring some over peanuts and coating the peanuts with the sauce.  Then I eat the nuts with a spoon to keep my hands clean.  Sounds gross but it's so delicious.
3742,3742,3742,3743,5,"I use this in my banquet kitchen for so many dishes.  It is a perfect blend of sweet and a pinch of heat.  If you toss chicken wings in it, you will have some great bar food in your own home!  Another idea: combine Sweet Chili sauce, heavy mayonnaise, granulated garlic, finely chopped parsely, ginger powder, and splash of siracha - this will give you a delicious sweet chili aoli perfect for burgers, sandwiches, egrolls, potstickers, fries, fish, or even chicken.  Like I said - it is good by itself, but serves as a great base for other things (from salad dressing to marinade).  Buy this sauce in bulk as you will find youself using it on everything!"
3743,3743,3743,3744,5,"I love this sauce. Sweet but hot too. I use it on checken wings instead of buffalo sauce and with pan seared scallops, shrimp. It's very versitile and delicious!"
3744,3744,3744,3745,4,"This sauce is good, but for my tastes it isn't hot enough.  I have had other brands tht have a sleeper heat that makes the sauce multi layered.  This sauce seems to ahve one layer."
3745,3745,3745,3746,5,"Once in a while you just want a spicy different flavor. Sometimes when I have a lightly seasoned or plain piece of beef or chicken, I put some Sweet Chili Sauce on my rice. Wow that perks up the whole plate. Other times I cook the meat without seasoning and add what every flavor I'm in the mood for when I reheat it. I've kept open bottles in my refrigerator for months without any problem.<br /><br />If you have never tried this, the sauce is thicker than Heinz Ketchup so you can slowly add sweetness and heat until its just right for you. Another way to use this is on steamed vegetables and you can add peanuts or sliced almonds just before serving."
3746,3746,3746,3747,5,"The sauce was just fine. However, I can't resist flagging a particular piece of idiocy, in the hope that someone might be able to convince Amazon next time. The sauce comes in a pack of 2, but one bottle was broken. Yep, you guessed it, Amazon sent me a new pack of two, and asked me to return the unbroken original. It's only cost me a little time, but how much it's going to cost Amazon to ship and process that returned bottle, your guess is as good as mine. Is it REALLY beyond the bounds of possibility for someone to have split a pack and just sent me the one replacement bottle?"
3747,3747,3747,3748,4,A really great Sauce but is slightly more expensive than in other stores. It is great for egg rolls or a dipping sauce for many chinese foods! It is also a great sauce to make Chili Thai sushi roll.
3748,3748,3748,3749,5,I've been using this sauce for over 9 years now. It's amazing. I use it on everything from spring rolls to salads.
3749,3749,3749,3750,5,"I made crab rangoon and used this sauce as a dipping sauce.  It was great.  I love the fact that it doesn't have MSG in it.  It has the right amount of sweetness.  It is a little spicy, but just the right amount."
3750,3750,3750,3751,5,"I use this in and on meats, fish, poultry, vegies, all purpose dip et al. It's cheap and very very special. I gave big bottles to family/friends at Xmas years ago and they are all  hooked. You won't be sorry you brought this sauce into your kitchen."
3751,3751,3751,3752,5,"Here's a tiny consolation: easy Thai barbecued chicken! Cut your usual fryer in quarters, cook it slowly over charcoal or quickly in a hot oven, and then brush it generously with ""sweet chili sauce"" and cook it just a few minutes more. Most authentic with 'sticky' rice but also delicious with brown or red rice.<br /><br />In Thailand, people squat over hibachi-sized braziers on the sidewalks and sell portion of this sort of barbecued chicken. Sometimes they trot alongside inter-city buses as they pull into stations, and sell chicken through the windows. Don't be squeamish! This is a treat you'll remember. The same sauce will enhance the flavor of any fowl from blackbird to condor or whooping crane."
3752,3752,3752,3753,5,This sauce is very good on anything you cook or grill or you can use it as a dip for veggies etc.  It has just enough heat to make everything taste better.
3753,3753,3753,3754,5,This is one of my favorite sauces to have handy. With this order you get two giant bottles which should last a while. The taste of this is perfect! Not for the faint of heart however...
3754,3754,3754,3755,5,"My whole family loves this sauce. I use it primarily to recreate a dish we had in Maui. It adds a wonderful sweet and spicy flavor to just about any sauce. Service on this order was spectacular. Several bottles arrived broken and replacements were received within days. Amazon service was fast, easy and reliable. I love Amazon. Also, there are many recipes that you can look up using this sauce that a very good. It goes spectaculary with coconut milk, vegetables, chicken or shrimp and pasta. We love it."
3755,3755,3755,3756,5,"I purchased this sauce as it is the exact same sauce used at the hot sauce bar of Tijuana Flats (http://www.tijuanaflats.com/).  It goes amazing with steak tostadas but in my home cooking, it works wells as a marinade and as a condiment."
3756,3756,3756,3757,5,"I was introduced to this sauce by a good friend of mine from Cambodia, who runs a Thai restaurant and bar.  I wondered what sauce was used in their ramikens when they served their delicious crispy spring rolls.  Their actual sauce was handmade, but I was directed to try this brand.  Since then, (about 5 yrs ago) my mother, friends, and I have all used this sauce on fried chicken wings, grilled and sauteed chicken, pork, spring/egg rolls, and even sushi!  I keep the large 25 oz bottle in my fridge year-round, and this is the best brand I've used thus far.  Not too hot for those not accustomed to very spicy foods, but is mostly sweet.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!! :o)"
3757,3757,3757,3758,5,"as mentioned...give this a try!  instant party food, frozen meatballs and this sauce... great on chicken, you name it...anything party/snack/happy hour food that you put sauce on would work with this.<br /><br />however the prices from some of the vendors OBSCENE.  $19 for 2 25oz bottles??  This stuff is $1.50-1.75 for the 10oz bottle at any asian grocery...."
3758,3758,3758,3759,5,"What I like most about this product is its unique taste. Just enough spiciness and sweetness to make it different but it goes with virtually anything. I haven't tried cooking with it but I can imagine it would add a lot to stews, soups, etc. It keeps well - the last bottle I had got lost in my pantry and was several years old when I found it and it still tasted great. It belongs along with the A1, Heinz 57, Worcestershire Sauce, Catsup, etc as a condiment staple."
3759,3759,3759,3760,5,I had brought this as a dipping sauce for dumplings and egg rolls I made at home. It taste's great and I think it the same sauce I get at some Thai places cause it tastes the exact same.
3760,3760,3760,3761,5,"This is delicious.  It makes a gourmet cook out of a novice.  Put it on chicken, pork, steak...it is ca c'est bon.  I wish I could say it in Chinese.  We love it. We purchase it on Amazon Prime.  Saves a trip to the market. Makes a wonderful hostess gift."
3761,3761,3761,3762,5,The best sauce on the market.  We use it on almost any food product but it is especially good on veggies.
3762,3762,3762,3763,5,"We cook a lot of Chinese dishes in our household and this sweet chili sauce is a MUST HAVE!  One of our favorites is sesame chicken, but we couldn't seem to get the flavor just right... that is, until we added this... YUM!!"
3763,3763,3763,3764,5,"I love asian flavor w/o the extreme heat.  I had this sauce w/ some wings at Mellow Mushroom in Knoxville, TN.  I immediately asked the bartender if he could find out the brand of the sauce for me because it was perfect.  Amazing flavor!!!"
3764,3764,3764,3765,5,"This is the best Sweet Chili sauce I have found anywhere. Some say its to sweet but hey, it's a Sweet Chili sauce and its supposed to be sweet. It has a rich full flavor that everyone in my family likes. Even my wife who can't stand anything anyone would consider hot just loves this sauce. I'm a pepper head myself. If you're like me and like a little more kick try adding some Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce to this and you will learn to love it too."
3765,3765,3765,3766,5,"This is without doubt the finest sweet chilli [sic] sauce in the world.  I use it with hot or cold dishes, including chicken, venison or roast beasts.  It is superb seasoning for a plain rice, quinoa, bulghour or cous-cous.  Sweet, hot and authentic.  I buy 2 of the larger bottles at a time, refrigerate the open one and save the back-up as insurance.  Could not run my varied menus without this great red elixir!"
3766,3766,3766,3767,5,"there where plenty of times we had to eat out...but...then came mae ploy sweet chili sauce...now we can eat in whih the same flavor, exciting taste as being at one of the favorite restaurants!!!"
3767,3767,3767,3768,5,"This sauce is something of a permanent staple on our table!! Just about everything gets a dash or two, or three!"
3768,3768,3768,3769,5,"not truly spicy my 2 year old loves this stuff!<br />great on chicken, even chicken nuggets, for spring rolls- the crispy ones and even fries.<br />it's sweet and spicy all in one so very good"
3769,3769,3769,3770,5,"I go to my mothers home one day she cooked fried chicken and rice. I taste the chicken, it is good! That was the day I was introduced to Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce. This sauce is Excellent being sweet and mild hot, will not burn your mouth or give heart burn. I will continue to purchase this product chicken, fish, and other foods are more tasteful. Try it because it is Good!"
3770,3770,3770,3771,5,"I use this stuff on pretty much everything. Turkey sandwiches, homemade sushi, scrambled eggs, chicken nuggets, and more. So perfect. Not too spicy, not too sour. Not too expensive either. Love it."
3771,3771,3771,3772,5,"I first tasted this sauce when I was visiting in Alaska.  It was served with fish tacos, and was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  I couldn't find it locally, so I ordered it from Amazon.  It's available for a reasonable price, and is wonderful with fish, pork and chicken.  I haven't tried it on beef, but not sure if it would be good or not.  It's also terrific on vegetables.  I highly recommend this product!"
3772,3772,3772,3773,5,"Sooo good, I followed some advice and thought outside of the conventional box. Sliced up some cabbage and onion and sprinkled some Mae Ploy chili sauce on it with some Lime juice too, made a nice salad with a kick! also very good with cilantro and daikon."
3773,3773,3773,3774,5,"If you have ever wondered what that delicious dipping sauce for the crab wontons are at pei wei, or the amazing sauce on Chang's chicken is, this is it!<br /><br />I love this stuff.  I discovered it while at a pei wei someone had left a bottle of this laying out and I quick snapped a picture, took it to amazon and found it. It is great on pretty much everything, as previous users say.  I was also in a Thai restaurant the other night and they used the same sauce on an amazing salad.  Try this on a do it yourself salad consisting of sliced mangos, lettuce, onions, and red peppers.  Drench those ingredients in this stuff and everyone will think your a master chef."
3774,3774,3774,3775,5,"This is the BEST!<br />Years ago, I used it & loved it! Moved & could not find it again. I have purchased many hot/sweet sauces over the years, trying to find this flavor. Recently, I found it again at World Market....now I'm addicted! Everyone has mentioned great ways to use it.<br />My favorite....I use it on my salads, along with a little fat-free dressing. Now, I eat tasty salads every day, (without the cheese!).<br /><br />Sodium is 200 mg per tablespoon....and the amount of added flavor is worth every mg!"
3775,3775,3775,3776,5,"This is a great multi-use sauce.  Great for using as a baste when grilling - fish, chicken, shrimp, pork, etc."
3776,3776,3776,3777,5,"This sauce is an excellent blend of sweet and spicy.  I love it with eggrolls, rice, just about anything that needs an extra kick.  Give it a try!"
3777,3777,3777,3778,5,"Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce is the best. I use it instead of duck sauce. Check it out. Once you try it, you'll be hooked."
3778,3778,3778,3779,5,"kids love the sauce on many things... great on rice, chicken, spicy & sweet.<br /><br />highly recommend."
3779,3779,3779,3780,5,Tried this sauce first at our favorite place to eat out.  Was very happy to be able to order some for our home cooking!  Great!  Spicy Hot and Sweet!
3780,3780,3780,3781,5,"I love this stuff.  I put it over chicken and even steaks.  It's very sweet, and just a bit spicy.  Just a little goes a long way."
3781,3781,3781,3782,5,"I did not purchase this product off of Amazon. I purchased the 12 oz. bottle at a local store, and I must say it's one of the most addicting sauces I have ever had! I'm a pretty picky eater, and a vegetarian at that, so sauces play a key role in making an average meal a great one. This sauce is ALMOST perfect. It's very sweet, and has a strong garlic taste at first. It isn't as thick as the Red Hot brand, which I didn't like much at all (thick, not as flavorful, way too chunky). This sauce would be appropriate for children who like a little kick for their chicken nuggets and what not. My son loves spicy food just like his mommy. Another plus is there are only 70 calories in 2 tablespoons, and that much sauce goes a long way. 1 gram of fiber, too! The only thing I have a hard time with, and this is just a personal issue, is the texture of the red chilli. They tastes great, but they have a very thin, clear ""skin"" that has this horrible crunchy texture on some of the pieces. Not all, just some. I get it stuck in my mouth and on my teeth and it hits a nerve that makes me feel a bit queasy. Still, I eat it anyway lol and will continue to do so because this is one of the best sauces I have EVER tasted! I would recommend anyone to try this sauce first, and then try others if you are not fully satisfied. This sauce is amazing. It was about $1.50 at the store for 12 oz. but if you like the easiness of ordering online or can't find it near you, know that I would pay Amazon's price for it any day! Buy this sauce. I don't care where or how, just buy it. You'll fall in love!"
3782,3782,3782,3783,5,Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce is becoming a standard condiment on my dinner table. It has just the right blend of sweet and heat; Mae Ploy enhances the taste of all meat and fish foods. Catsup is almost a condiment of the past. Salsa and Mae Ploy are the answers!
3783,3783,3783,3784,3,"I was excited to try this sauce based on the reviews, but it's nothing special. For my taste, it's way too sweet and not nearly spicy enough (even my kids agree). It reminds me of honey mixed with sweet pickle relish, so if that sounds good to you, go for it. But if you're more interested in something more spicy, hot and even a little sour, you might want to keep looking."
3784,3784,3784,3785,3,These are very large bottles. It is a good dipping sauce with a sweet/spicy flavor.
3785,3785,3785,3786,1,"I was looking for a good sweet and sour sauce for chicken and based on the reviews, I took a chance.  Well, no one in the family likes this stuff- it tastes nothing like sweet and sour sauce- more like what it says it is- Chili Sauce.  Now I'm stuck with two huge bottles.  Sometimes reading the label is really all that matters."
3786,3786,3786,3787,5,"I have been using this curry paste for several years now, and it makes a great dish. Although it doesn't beat eating Indian out, its the best paste I have used for at home dishes. Even though this is a ""hot"" paste, I would consider it mild."
3787,3787,3787,3788,5,"Patak's sauces have many uses but I always make a basic chicken curry.  A friend from India taught this recipe to me, and now I always have a jar or two on hand.  If you want you can get one of the Indian pickles/relishes as a garnish.  This is easy but is a bit time consuming with all the dicing and sauteing.  Typically the recipe as written takes an hour or so from start to finish, and serves 3-4 adults.  I always make at least a double batch; it's just as easy and that way I have leftovers to freeze and everyone can have plenty to eat.  You can use any rice, but basmati is so fragrant that it is what I prefer.  Some Indian groceries have frozen Naan you can heat in the oven for an even more satisfying dinner.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />1-1 ½ lbs chicken breast cut into 1-2"" cubes<br />1 cup nonfat plain yogurt<br />Salt<br />3 tbs Patak's curry paste, flavor/heat depending on your taste<br /><br />1 (generous) tsp cumin seed<br />1 (generous) tsp mustard seed<br />1 small onion diced<br />3 cloves garlic diced<br />2 medium potatoes, diced same size as chicken cubes<br />2-3 carrots, diced same size as chicken cubes<br />1 14 oz can diced tomatoes with juice<br />½ cup frozen peas<br />2-3 tbsp cooking oil<br />Salt to taste<br /><br />1. Add chicken yogurt, curry paste and about ½ tsp salt to a bowl; mix thoroughly and let marinate while you prepare vegetables<br />2. Heat oil in large frying pan over medium heat until hot<br />3. Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds, stir.  They are ready when mustard seeds start to pop.  Do not let them burn.<br />4. Add onion and garlic.  Saute until soft.  Stir constantly or else it will burn.<br />5. Add carrots and potatoes.  Saute until potatoes are just about ready to eat.  You have to stir very frequently or they will stick/burn.  I do not let anything caramelize.<br />6. Add chicken/yogurt mixture.  Saute a few minutes until chicken is about half cooked through.  Lower heat to low.<br />7. Add tomatoes and let simmer until the juices cook down a bit, and chicken is cooked through.<br />8. Add peas for color.  Add salt to taste.<br />9. Serve over freshly cooked basmati rice.  Remember to soak the basmati rice prior to cooking or it will be hard."
3788,3788,3788,3789,5,Patak's makes the best curry around. I frequently use it in my Yellow Chicken Curry Dish which is a favorite with both my husband and seven year old.
3789,3789,3789,3790,5,"I first drank this tea at Naniboujou Lodge on the North Shore of Minnesota, and bought a small packet up there. I was hooked, so after I had drunk the first bit I bought I wanted to get more of this tea ASAP. Was glad to see it for sale in such a high quantity here. I used to be a coffee drinker, but I much prefer tea -- specifically, Ashbys Afternoon Tea -- now, and I just gave away a bag of coffee I'll never drink. I never quite got why British people are so into tea, but -- whether this is a typical British tea or not, I don't know -- I now see why they'd build their afternoons around a high-quality tea like this one. Sublime."
3790,3790,3790,3791,5,"The Gevalia Breakfast Blend is perhaps the best coffee I have ever purchased.  It is full-bodied, without being bitter.  It also is much cheaper to purchase through Amazon - with Free shipping for prime members.  Cant' beat it."
3791,3791,3791,3792,5,I've tried the other gevalia flavors and this is the only one i like (french vanilla stinks)> Its like your regular cup of coffee that goes with any flavred creamer
3792,3792,3792,3793,5,"Have drunk this as my ""standard brew"" for years.  However, tastes change, and I'm beginning to sense that it's a little on the light side for my maturing tastes.  Nothing wrong with it - it's better than most restaurant coffees by a wide margin."
3793,3793,3793,3794,5,"I was surprised to learn that Amazon sells Gevalia coffee, which led me to search Amazon for other household items at great prices. I wish all shopping could be this easy.<br /><br />Update: 12/24/11.  How can the price go from $15.00 to over $47.00. Yikes I guess no more Gevalia for me if that price is correct?"
3794,3794,3794,3795,5,"Stocking stuffer gift for family.  Love this brand & blend.  Full bodied, not too dark, not too weak.  Just right.  This has become a family favorite that everyone looks forward to receiving."
3795,3795,3795,3796,5,Everything that is stated in the information is exactly what I had recieved.  thank you
3796,3796,3796,3797,5,"I purchased this coffee for my grandfather, an old vet and lifelong coffee drinker. He thoroughly enjoyed it and we were able to share many stories over a nice pot of Gevalia. I would definitely recommend this brand, especially this blend, to anyone that loves a good brew. Cheers!"
3797,3797,3797,3798,5,"Several Gevalia brand coffee's have been among my favorites for years....Velvet Noir, Signature Blend, Traditional Roast, etc.  The Breakfast Blend is my ""go to"" every day grind.  It's got a perfect blend of bold rich taste, terrific aroma, and full taste, with very low acidity and harshness.  Just incredible coffee!"
3798,3798,3798,3799,5,"I tried this coffee two years ago and found it much better then other brands of coffee I had had before. Since then I have been buying Gevalia coffee at Amazon. Amazon offers a good price, even lower than that on the Gevalia online store."
3799,3799,3799,3800,5,"The breakfast blend has always been one of my personal favorites from Gevalia.  Gives whole new reason to getting up early on Saturday.  Plus, the Amazon price could not be beat!"
3800,3800,3800,3801,5,I love Geliva coffee.Its not bitter like some of the brands and it set well on my stomach.I have too say its the best coffee I every had and I tried a lot of expensive brands as well as the lesser expensive this is mid price and I love it.I will continue to buy this frm Amazon every three months
3801,3801,3801,3802,5,Gevalia Kaffee is by FAR the best coffee on the market.<br />Especially the Coastarican peaberry and the Peruvian organic.
3802,3802,3802,3803,5,"Gevalia is the best coffee there is - always mellow, never bitter. I'd never drink any other brand."
3803,3803,3803,3804,1,"I went to check out and found out that the freight is $14.00 on an $11.00 (canned, not fresh produce)??!!  RIDICULOUS!!"
3804,3804,3804,3805,5,I received a box of this for Christmas. It is really good. Not overly strong like most black licorice. It is indeed soft and it has a very simple ingredient list with NO High Fructose Corn Syrup like most candy:<br />Molasses<br />Wheat Flour<br />Licorice Extract<br />Natural Flavor (Aniseed Oil)
3805,3805,3805,3806,5,"This is the best licorice ever!  Or at least the best I've ever had or can conceive of.  The only problem is that now that my 12-pack is gone, it's hard to concentrate on my work as I go through Panda withdrawal and cannot think of anything but Panda."
3806,3806,3806,3807,5,"This is real licorice. It is soft, has great taste, and is very healthy! Love it."
3807,3807,3807,3808,5,I have been eating Panda Licorice for a number of years and it is hard for someone who loves licorice to eat any other brand.  This is all natural (which is what makes it taste great) from the licorice root.  Fresh always because of the unique packaging and the most flavorful.
3808,3808,3808,3809,5,"THESE CHEWS ARE TASTY AND CHEWY. THE PRICE IS EXCELLENT FOR WHAT YOU GET. WE HAVE PLENTY AROUND FOR OURSELVES AND TO SHARE WITH FAMILY. GREAT TREAT FOR LITTLE KIDS.<br />PLUS THEY ARE GOOD FOR YOU WITH NO ADDED JUNK. JUST LICORICE.<br />GREAT BUY, GREAT TASTE."
3809,3809,3809,3810,5,This is what black licorice should taste like!  No artificial off-flavor.  No nasty artificial black dye to coat your tongue and teeth.  Wonderfully soft and chewy.  I took a box into work and everyone agreed that it was the best black licorice that they had ever tasted.
3810,3810,3810,3811,5,My daughter and I were looking for some real licorice and after reading several reviews about different brands of licorice we ordered the Panda licorice. We are very happy with Panda and will order again soon.
3811,3811,3811,3812,5,"This is the best licorice in the USA. If you have a craving for something sweet, this is it. And so good for you. I Love it and the price is very reasonable. i will continue to order this product. It is always fresh."
3812,3812,3812,3813,5,"this black licorice has great flavor and texture. Some are too soft and too sweet for me. Personal preference I'm sure, but I like this because it's slightly firm (not hard but not soft) and the sweetness is just right. Love that it's only 4 ingredients: molasses, wheat flour, licorice extract and aniseed oil. Price is good too. Compares to Tire Tread Licorice which is my first choice but I can't find it."
3813,3813,3813,3814,5,"Just received these boxes rather than buying the bar type that I did before.EXCELLENT! They are small bite size pieces that are soft and flavorful. Really fresh. I did the subscribe and save and am happy that I did. My husband and I really enjoy this brand. The boxes are larger than I realized, But I still will carry this item in my purse for a pick me up and to have a handy snack available with me. The boxes have a open and close tab with a plastic seal over the product once you open the box. I can't find one bad thing to say. No dissapointments at all."
3814,3814,3814,3815,5,"I, myself, do not care for licorice but my husband thinks this is the best licorice he has ever had and he loves the stuff.  I have also given it to two friends who are licorice lovers and they say it is delicious."
3815,3815,3815,3816,5,Panda All Natural Soft Licorice is a great snack for family movie time.<br />We consume it like it was water. It's the best snack next to popcorn.
3816,3816,3816,3817,5,This all natural licorice is very good -- I highly recommend it.  I bought this as I a read natural licorice is good for an upset stomach.
3817,3817,3817,3818,5,This is by far my favorite black licorice - and the list of ingred. could not possibly be shorter or better!  Now if I could learn how to NOT eat the whole box in one sitting...
3818,3818,3818,3819,5,"If you deal with diabetes or hypoglycemia, please use real licorice products with care.  I ate some of this yesterdy (it was delicious!) and had to skip both my dinner insukin shots.  I also woke in the night with a reading of 66-too low for comfort!  So, if you have insulin resistance, please be aware that true licorice candies or extract may have an affect on your body.  BTW, I am buying more today to use medically.  (I just won't eat so much in one day) What a lovely way to get out of getting shots! :>)"
3819,3819,3819,3820,5,"Quality and delicious licorice! And this is the best price/oz I could find for quality licorice anywhere. Highly recommended, if you're into buying $30 worth of candy. (You can subscribe for the lower price and then unsubscribe no problem)"
3820,3820,3820,3821,5,"love it. eating it has got to be a ritual. taste is well balanced, nice and chewy without being overly sticky, leave a great lingering aftertaste.<br /><br />compared to gimbal's scottish dogs, these taste and feel more traditional, and much healthier too, given that only four ingredients go into them.<br /><br />out in the midwest, ann abor to be specific, i found these in the candy aisle for around $2.80 per resealable bag of 170g."
3821,3821,3821,3822,5,I got the licorice at a cheese shop in New York and by the time I got home it was all gone. So got on the computer and found and bought some. That's how much I liked it. I have not done the before and do not regret buying it. Yummmmmm.
3822,3822,3822,3823,5,"If you liked licorice as a child, this is a dream come true.  It is soft, and the taste rolls off the back of your tongue---but you can't eat just one (box)."
3823,3823,3823,3824,5,"I love this licorice and as someone with a lot of food allergies, I appreciate that it only has four ingredients."
3824,3824,3824,3825,4,"The Panda black licorice is an excellent product.  The raspberry flavor tastes mostly like molasses.  This is fine if you value an all natural product, but it is not what I expected.  The two flavors that I bought have all been consumed so they tasted good."
3825,3825,3825,3826,5,"Some licorice products leave the teeth with a black film but not so with the Panda soft licorice chews.  It is a delicious licorice product that improves with age, in my opinion.  The candy from a freshly opened box is very soft and tends to stick in the teeth more than candy from a box which has been opened and closed for several days because it hardens as air circulates around the candy.  If I place it in an airtight container, it remains soft, but I really love it as the texture changes.  The flavor is consistently delicious and it is now my licorice of choice.  I was expecting the box to contain a plastic bag but it simply has a plastic seal along the top of the box with nothing inside to seal.  Therefore, if you want your licorice to remain fresh, I'd recommend placing it in an airtight container.  I've also purchased the raspberry flavor but haven't tried that yet.  I have a hard time considering fruit flavored candies as ""licorice,"" but enjoy the confection also."
3826,3826,3826,3827,5,"I've always liked licorice candy and the best licorice I've ever had was obtained at Ikea. It was from Sweden. Yum! In any case, I've mentioned this around and then a box of Panda Soft Licorice appeared in my Christmas stocking.<br /><br />The Panda licorice is good. Real good. Excellent flavor. Nice and chewy. Good aftertaste. I'd rank it with the best I've had. It's imported from Finland and is made from all natural ingredients. In my opinion, it doesn't quite make it up to the licorice I obtain at Ikea, but it's close.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
3827,3827,3827,3828,5,This is by far my favorite licorice....to the point I have a case delivered on a regular monthly basis......an option offered by Amazon......a VERY convenient service......
3828,3828,3828,3829,5,this product comes from finland and is an all natural product that is always fresh and I have never tasted better licorice in my life.  This product arrived fast in a protective box and the price is great.  I will purchase another case now.
3829,3829,3829,3830,5,Nothing but good feedback from everyone. A very good classic tasting licorice product. We buy it on subscription and save shipping and a little money.
3830,3830,3830,3831,5,"I first saw this product, Panda Licorice, at the Memphis, TN zoo at the Panda exhibit.  I thought it was just a promotion for the zoo. I bought some. It was the really good old-fashion black Licorice I used to get when I was a kid. Not the chalky no taste stuff most is today. While at the Norway part of Epcot at Disney FL this year I found the same thing. Then I realized it is a company brand name made in Finland not a zoo promotion. I bought some more. It cost $5 per 7 oz box. When I got home I checked several websites and Amazon was the cheapest. Pack of 12 boxes total cost shipped to me(there was a free shipping deal) Came to $2.50 per 7 oz box. It is totally delicious. When this is gone I will surly order more."
3831,3831,3831,3832,5,I love these licorice.  Get licorice flavor--not just sugar with some flavor.  Very satisfying.
3832,3832,3832,3833,5,"I sent the Panda licorice to my brother-in-law who really knows his licorice.  He usually buys it by mail specially from one company.  His comment was ""delicious""."
3833,3833,3833,3834,5,This licorice is great.  It taste like the old fashion rope licorice. I will continue to buy it.
3834,3834,3834,3835,5,"I have been enjoying this product for some time.  I buy it at Wegmans grocery store, I believe the cost is under $4.00 a box.  If you like black licorice you will love this product."
3835,3835,3835,3836,5,Panda licorice is great. It is always received fresh and is much better tasting than the Red Vines or Twizzler brands.  I highly recommend a standing order (approximately every 3 months) which reduces the overall price per box.<br />  Amazon is a very reliable and communicative mail order company. ALOHA!
3836,3836,3836,3837,5,"For those of you who like/love black licorice, I seriously recommend this product.  i eat it because I love black licorice, and only recently found that what I have observed is now reported by nuitionists as well.  These is evidence that black licorice is an aid to those with constipation.  It comes in other flavors too, but the medicinal effects only come the black."
3837,3837,3837,3838,5,I am a fan of black licorice.  PANDA black licorice is simply the best black licorice that I have ever eaten!  Well done PANDA!
3838,3838,3838,3839,3,"Panda has good flavor but the texture and shape is not the best. It does not have enough chew and I find it a bit dry.<br /><br /> I much prefer RJ's with it's big solid tubes and excellent natural licorice flavor and satisfying, just right chew without being gummy."
3839,3839,3839,3840,4,"Not the best I've ever had, but good. The best I've had was expensive and from an English company (I can't remember the name). But this is better than the movie kind. They're not quite as moist and rich as the best ones I've tried."
3840,3840,3840,3841,3,"I've found a new licorice,,this one is ok.,But I really don't need the extra sodium in my body...."
3841,3841,3841,3842,5,"Wimpy coffee drinkers beware, this is not the bean for you.<br />If you like strong, bold flavor, you have found it in Larry's.  What a great coffee,<br />Starbucks move over, Larry is in first place!!"
3842,3842,3842,3843,5,i'm not much of a candy eater but these suckers are fantastic. sweet and long lasting. my whole family is addicted to this great treat
3843,3843,3843,3844,4,"The first can that I got of this wonderful oil was packed in a poor way: an old, reused box with not enough padding.  When I complained the company was quick to respond - with an apology and a new can packed well for the mail.  I was impressed with their responsiveness.  The Merula oil itself was excellent - a great treat."
3844,3844,3844,3845,5,"My review is of the Strawberry-Melon flavor only. I did not try the other flavors in the variety pack as I puchased mine individually.<br /><br />I don't usually drink these types of beverages, nor do I drink much soda. I generally dislike overly sweet, artificial ingredient laden stuff. Quite by chance I tried a Strawberry Melon FUZE slenderize beverage and really liked it.<br /><br />What I liked most was the pleasing flavor and the absence of sugar, although it does have sucralose as a sweetener (rather than aspartame). It was not overly sweetened and the blend of strawberry and melon flavor was for me perfectly balanced; I could clearly distinguish both flavors.  FUZE was really tasty, no strong aftertaste and no sugar ""heaviness"" in the mouth. It was honestly the first time I've had this type of beverage other than a Snapple Tea beverage that I would purchase again.<br /><br />I'm a little skeptical of the benefits of the micro-nutrients that are added to this beverage; L-Carnitine, Super Citrimax and Chromium. Perhaps it's a bit more marketing hype rather than beneficial. Nonetheless, I found this beverage to be refreshing, tasty and something I would buy again.<br /><br />It is a little bit pricey though. Compared to a 12-pack of store brand Diet Soda, which in my neck of the woods ia around $2.99 or a little over $.02/ounce, FUZE beverage is priced $24.99 for 15-18.5 ounce bottles, or a little over $.09/ounce. That makes it more than 4 times as expensive as the store brand diet sodas.<br /><br />In spite of the price, I would buy this again and would justify the price by considering this more of a treat rather than a water substitute.<br /><br />5 stars."
3845,3845,3845,3846,5,"I don't drink a lot of sugary drinks and soft drinks.  I try to watch sugar intake and dislike overly sweet drinks.  By chance, I tried one of the Slenderize drinks and was amazed.  The drink is truly lightly sweet, using natural fruit juices, acesulfame-potassium, and sucralose as sweeteners.  Would definitely recommend to anyone who would like a soft drink replacement that still isn't as sweet as a typical ""diet"" drink."
3846,3846,3846,3847,5,"I have been looking for a nice strong rose tea, and this is the one!  I've tried a number of brands, but they weren't ""rosy"" enough for me.  This is an excellent tea with a strong rose flavor.  No bitterness - nice and smooth.  I highly recommend this tea!"
3847,3847,3847,3848,5,"the aroma is amazing, like a walk in my rose garden, minus the bees...but add a little honey in the tea and there you are. Beautiful. Taste is smooth, full, delicious."
3848,3848,3848,3849,5,"I visited a winery/vineyard in Tuscany where they sold Leonardi Balsamico vinegar as well as all the wines.  The flavor of this balsamic is so difficult to describe but it is smooth! I was used to grocery store balsamic vinegar and some ""specialty"" store balsamic vinegars.  It's like comparing skim milk (yuk) to cream - which would you rather put in your gourmet dishes?"
3849,3849,3849,3850,5,"There are two types of larger suckers sold on Amazon, I got the tropical ones this time. Just as good as the regular kind. These ones have a mixture of sour and sweeter parts. Well worth the money."
3850,3850,3850,3851,5,"These Mega lollies are the best i eat 10 a day so they go quickly, i'm not going to tell you how many ive bought since Jan. 1 this year. They are great i love them."
3851,3851,3851,3852,5,I am addicted to this candy. Will try not to order another batch for awhile!!! This is my candy to eat on the ride home from work in traffic to keep me calm.
3852,3852,3852,3853,3,"The Melitta Java Pods Have a slightly smaller circumference than the Senseo pods and are thicker. If you are using a Senseo coffee machine, you probably should moisten the Java pod and smooth it before attempting to latch the lid. Otherwise, you risk breaking the latching mechanism. The resulting decaf coffee is not bad and seems to this reviewer to have a richer taste than the Senseo decaf pods. The Melitta Java pods are not really designed for the Senseo machine and several other brands such as Halo, Fratello and Millstone work better in the Senseo machine."
3853,3853,3853,3854,2,Although this coffee tastes fine there is nowhere enough coffee in the pod.  The cup that is brewed even with a smaller amount of water is weak and watery.
3854,3854,3854,3855,4,The Parisian Cafe blend is wonderful but it is too thick to fit correctly in the Senseo machine.  The box advertises universal fit but it is not.
3855,3855,3855,3856,5,"Coffee has a great flavor and is not too acidic. Fits perfectly in out ""Juan Valdez"" pod maker that was purchased at Target several years ago! So hard to find these so was glad to find them on Amazon!"
3856,3856,3856,3857,4,"Smooth coffee, but a bit to big for senseo, interestingly all the other Melitta One pod flavors fit just fine in senseo, my fav are french kisses and vanilla haze."
3857,3857,3857,3858,1,My husband didn't care for this coffee at all.  He complained it lacked flavor and aroma.
3858,3858,3858,3859,5,"We love Melitta coffee pods.  Makes a perfect cup of coffee every time. The coffee is always delicious, even the decaf blend!  If you have a coffee pod machine, try all of their blends...they're great!"
3859,3859,3859,3860,5,I love coffee and at night really miss out if I don't have the decaff.
3860,3860,3860,3861,5,"This decaf pod has wonderful flavor.  It is much better than their previous decaf ""Skip the Buzz"".  I'm glad they upgraded their product."
3861,3861,3861,3862,4,"I had bought a Black and Decker one-cup coffee maker that used these pods.  It didn't work properly, but I have managed to use the pods with my old, stand-by coffee maker and am please with the flavor and convenience.  Someone had commented about a problem with some of the pods being sealed in the outer packaging.  I have not encountered that problem.  Overall, I am pleased with this purchase."
3862,3862,3862,3863,3,Some issues with the product -- some of the pods are not sealed properly so the grounds spill out (either before use or after use into your coffee); it is wasteful that each pod is individually sealed -- would rather they be packaged like the Senseo pods; the pods don't really fit my Senseo coffee maker -- too fat for the single and too small for the double which causes problems sometimes when I brew a cup.  On the plus side -- price.
3863,3863,3863,3864,3,"Melitta pods are full flavored; however, they do not fit my senseo coffee machine.  One pod in a two pod holder is too small and two pods are too large.  Sure do wish senseo was still readily available in the super markets!"
3864,3864,3864,3865,5,"My mom has the Hamilton Beach single cup coffee maker and was using Senseo pods in it. They were too strong / bitter for her and I was searching for something else.  Found these and Wolfgang Puck's and decided to get both for her.  These Melitta Breakfast Blend pods are her favorite! She says they have a smooth taste and great flavor. Granted, neither of us would ever be mistaken for a coffee judge by anyone (I don't even drink coffee so my opinion means nothing), but she really likes these and is happy to have them."
3865,3865,3865,3866,2,To make a decent cup of coffee I have to use two pods at a time. I prefer a strong cup of coffee even if it IS decaf.<br />What happened to Senseo decaf?
3866,3866,3866,3867,5,this was delicious coffee for a great price which i could not find at any store in my area or areas nearby
3867,3867,3867,3868,5,Enjoying my Java Pods very much. Easy and fast. Medium strong to wake me up. I get positive comments on the convenience of making coffee.
3868,3868,3868,3869,1,"This coffee .<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0508Y"">Melitta One:One Java Pods,Breakfast Blend Coffee, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 4)</a> is terrible. Cheap beans, bad roast, whatever, my lot actually tastes like it is moldy. Maybe I just got a bad batch. I have tried the Buzzworthy dark roast Melitta Pods and they are drinkable, even though I prefer medium roast coffees. Suggest you try one box of these, not the 4 box lot I'm stuck with. Also, to help you evaluate this response better, you should know that I like quality roast Kenya AA or Sumatra or Columbian Supremo, etc. rich flavor type coffees. I don't like Folgers, Maxwell House, pedestrian type blends, but even those are way better than this coffee."
3869,3869,3869,3870,5,Melitta Pods are an inexpensive alternative to k-cups  that also save in the amount of material you have to throw away. Buyer Beware: Pods vary GREATLY in the amount of coffee they have in them. These allow for a good size cup of coffee.
3870,3870,3870,3871,2,"I have a Melitta One:One machine and have been using Juan Valdez pods in it.  When I ran out I searched for pods for it & only came up with these Melitta-brand ones. I figured (incorrectly) that the others weren't available & purchased these. VERY disappointing.  My coffee had been nice, strong & tasty, but coffee made with these is weak & tasteless.  I bought a 4-box package of three different types & am now stuck with them. Forget these & head to Juan Valdez (same price range) unless you like weak coffee."
3871,3871,3871,3872,5,I've been using these for a couple of years now. I highly recommend these if you only need 1 cup of coffee.
3872,3872,3872,3873,5,This is one of the best decaf coffee's I have ever had.  I was ordering this product from another website but found that Amazon's subscribe and safe plan is the most economical.  Great Product.
3873,3873,3873,3874,3,"A decent, clean, and simple cup of morning decaf. I find pre-wetting the pod helps extract a little extra flavor."
3874,3874,3874,3875,3,Parisian Cafe' was not may favorite blend for breakfast coffee.  I prefer others of the Melitta brand.
3875,3875,3875,3876,5,"Though London Fruit and Herb Company's Blueberry Bliss tea is one of the best teas I have ever had I cannot understand why Amazon has not begun shipping it out to customers who ordered this item months ago! It IS now available through other Vendors (i.e. Wendell Tea Company in MA) but not at the Amazon price.  If is's available to them it should be available to Amazon or they should take it off their inventory as an offering.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004A85G52"">London Fruit & Herb Company Blueberry Bliss Tea, 20-Count (Pack of 6)</a>"
3876,3876,3876,3877,5,"I love peppermint, but find hard candy just too strong.  These melt in your mouth and aren't overwhelming and don't leave an aftertaste."
3877,3877,3877,3878,1,"I can get it at Walmart for $1.78 each or the gas station for $3.50 for 2. Why, just why?"
3878,3878,3878,3879,5,We bought this to use with recipes for our Tagine.  This is an amazing spice and at an excellent price! Will buy from again
3879,3879,3879,3880,4,"Ras el Hanout is a versatile Moroccan spice blend that can be used for marinading meats (with a little oil and vinegar, maybe some crushed garlic), making stews, or just mixed with olive oil (and maybe a little crushed garlic) for dipping bread.  You can find many recipes that use it with a google term like ""ras el hanout lamb recipe"".  Note that it is sometimes spelled ""ras el hanoud"", so you can find even more using that.<br /><br />I first found this at the famous (and expensive) spice market in Istanbul.  This blend from Angelina's is nearly as good.  Note that there is no one recipe for this spice blend, and there are many private recipes with a good deal of variation."
3880,3880,3880,3881,5,I love the taste of this ras el hanout in my rice cooker for brown rice and quinoa. It makes the meal so much more special. Large size too that will last awhile.
3881,3881,3881,3882,5,"This is a nice, complex spice blend that makes Moroccan food, but it can also very easily be used to give body to a quick ""I don't know what to fix for supper"" kind of dish.  It's a great emergency item to have in the cupboard!"
3882,3882,3882,3883,4,"This spice can be tricky to get good quality and this one arrived quick and the flavors are spot on, use it to marinate fish or chicken then grill it, love it!"
3883,3883,3883,3884,5,"Not sure it should be legal. We put this --and a few other spices I won't share here--on some lamb chops and just fried them. They were AMAZING. This spice tastes pretty hot by itself, which makes it a bit hard to figure out how a blend with it and other spices is going to turn out. The end result, strangely, was not hot at all. Since I like spicy, I would usually have been disappointed, but this was so good, I did not even CARE. Seriously--you have to try this. I ordered two other spices at the same time, neither of which will be getting a GOOD review."
3884,3884,3884,3885,5,"Cannot consider ourselves experts on North African or Middle Eastern cuisine, or having enough experience with Ras El Hanout to say the aroma and taste is better than competitors.  But the product was extremely fresh and of exquisite smell and taste so am very pleased with the purchase.  Will buy more when the time comes."
3885,3885,3885,3886,5,"I love these noodles.  They are really great for a midnight snack.  It's not really something that will fill you up for a dinner.  If you do eat it for dinner, you will be hungry later.  Maybe some people wouldn't!!!!  But, it just doesn't stick to my ribs.  I love them though and Amazon has a really good price."
3886,3886,3886,3887,5,"This soup cooks up quickly and is very yummy! I really like the flavor of the seasoning packet and the way the noodles cook up, nice texture. It is very satisfying to me. I'm a single gal who doesn't really cook & am often in a hurry for my next meal, and I find that this soup really hits the spot. Although it does tend to be more of a mid-afternoon snack/light lunch item for me. It will tide you over for a while until your next big meal, but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hours.<br /><br />Personally I LOOOVE this soup that much more because I had to give up the ramen cup o' noodle and some other brands i had been eating because I developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks.  It seems that often these instant noodle packets/bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish. This one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do. Another plus for me is that it's not spicy. I'm kind of a wimp with spicy foods, plus i have GERD/reflux, so believe me if i can eat it is NOT spicy. Just tasty :)<br /><br />One thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable (in my town they only take 1's and 2's which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of.) Oh well, can't have it all...."
3887,3887,3887,3888,1,"I'm flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that ""truffle oil"" is receiving on Amazon! Those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny $17 bottles of ""truffle oil"" are made in a laboratory. There's not a molecule of actual truffle in them. It's a sinful shame that's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening New York Times article called ""Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles."" Read it and weep: [...]<br /><br />And if you see ""truffle oil"" advertised on the menu somewhere, you might ask if they're using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes..."
3888,3888,3888,3889,5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GEVGXA"">Goccia Black Truffle Oil from Italy</a><br />i highly recommend this product, for the price, the qaulity is exceptional.  It brings on a strong 'sense of euphoria'"
3889,3889,3889,3890,4,This black truffle oil from Italy is fabulous.  It's strong and subtle at the same time.  It's the best deal for exceptional flavor.
3890,3890,3890,3891,5,"I've never had Sunchy Malta before (I drank a lot of Goya when it was available locally). Tastes similar to Goya, though with less of a sour taste and slightly less carbonation.<br /><br />I ordered 50 bottles in order to get free shipping. Said bottles arrived in 4 large boxes, with each bottle individually packed. None broke. At the time of purchase, this was the best deal going for Malta either locally or in stores (I've never paid less than fifty cents anywhere).<br /><br />Now, though, the free shipping is gone. Unless  Sunchy seriously expects me to drop $7.50 for shipping per bottle, it's unlikely I'll be buying anymore. They should consider selling by the pack or case if they wish to pursue the online business model.<br /><br />So, 5 stars for value and the quality of packing, with the caveat that I won't be buying any more until Sunchy figures out how to sell it."
3891,3891,3891,3892,5,"After reading that corn (and of course pop corn) was heavily sprayed with pesticides and agriculture uses lots of chemicals in the soil to grow it, I decided enough was enough. It was time to spend a little more and get organic. Supplier shipped quickly. Eden Foods puts out a great product. (Edenfoods.com). Certified organic and pops up nicely. I use a brown lunch bag (top folded down) with 2 TB of corn and 45 sec. in the microwave. (Your microwave time may vary). Voila! perfection. Add some splenda/cinnamon/cocoa powder mixture and yum yum. (mixture sticks really well if you spray popcorn with a little cooking spray) Only 80 calories for 2 TB! No worries!"
3892,3892,3892,3893,2,"It's not real crispy, sticks to your teeth and lots of hulls.<br /><br />I know homemade popcorn has a few more kernel hulls than your store-bought microwave, but it's a little too much for me. I was really hopeful for this brand. But, it just didn't work out. I tried a couple of different methods; popped using different temperatures, and also tried different oils. It was the same both times with no improvement. It doesn't get better after it cools either..nothing worked to improve it.<br /><br />It doesn't taste old, so I know it's not that. I seal my popcorn kernels when I'm not using them as well. The flavor is really mild and it's definitely a good tasting popcorn. It just doesn't turn out the way it should."
3893,3893,3893,3894,4,"It is very good popcorn.  But I used a hotair machine so may not have been as yummy as if the oily stuff had been used.  Although I did pour oil on afterwards.  Why would I do that with an airpopper you ask?  Because the airpopper was a gift.  I really can't tell a whole lot of difference in the taste from Orville R. and this, but what I have read is this is organic and much better for you.  But the price is well...pricey. No I don't intend to buy again for that reason, but should my conscience tweek me towards healthier choice popcorn again then I may change my mind."
3894,3894,3894,3895,5,This really is the only choice when it comes to soy and dairy free baking (unless you want to use lard).  The Spectrum shortening uses palm kernel oil and has the consistancy of regular Crisco (perhaps a little stiffer).  It seems to bake just fine and if you need to be soy and dairy free I highly recommend it.
3895,3895,3895,3896,5,"We have used this for all types of baking, including cakes, biscuits, and cookies.  It works great and is every bit as good as crisco.  Buy Organic!"
3896,3896,3896,3897,5,"This makes the best tortillas.  That is about all I use this for, so it lasts me awhile.<br />Mine cost about 1/2 the price as listed here, but it was on sale where I bought it too."
3897,3897,3897,3898,5,"The 500 Mile Chai is just wonderful - the right balance of mellowness and spiciness.  I've tried some chai's that are a bit too spicy, but this one is very well balanced.  Great with almond milk and bonus points for it being organic (in as much as one can trust the ""organic"" label...).<br /><br />Compare to Peet's chai, I like the 500 mile better, as IMO Peet's is a little too much on the spicy side (although I do still like Peet's and some may prefer that flavor profile)."
3898,3898,3898,3899,5,"A fabulous variety of hot sauces with a range of flavors and heat. I bought it for a gift for my brother so I ended up sampling, using them myself. Truly flavorful! And hot! I use it in my omelets. Burritos. Nachos. Beans."
3899,3899,3899,3900,3,"If you're used to Dave's Insanity sauce, or like me you're used to Dave's Ultimate Insanity sauce, you're going to be really disappointed. 5 of the 6 sauces aren't spicy at all. They're probably at a spiciness level below Tobasco sauce. I tried really hard to like them but I just can't get over how watery and weak they are. The only saving grace of the package is that it comes with a bottle of regular Insanity sauce, but as I mentioned above, I prefer the Ultimate Insanity sauce. I guess I have plenty of salad dressings."
3900,3900,3900,3901,5,"I bought this gift pack and really enjoyed it. The hottest hot sauce in the pack is so darn hot it had me burning for about 30 minutes and washing my mouth out with water for 10. Other than that one, all the others were really good. The wooden case doesn't hold the bottles well but the sauces were good. I would buy it again."
3901,3901,3901,3902,4,"This is a cool kit for gifts, or a great price on a kit of Dave's Sauce if you use it at home.  A good variety.  My only issue is that the bottles do not hold in the wood gift box very well at all, they slide up and down until they fall out of the open spaces in the front or back of the wooden gift box.  I would buy again."
3902,3902,3902,3903,3,I am a casual sauce user and the taste of these sauces was just OK.  Nothing special...  The insanity hot sauce was fun to try though.  I probably would not purchase again since they are pretty darn expensive.
3903,3903,3903,3904,5,"gave these as a gift to my brother. we are both fans of hot sauces so i thought i'd give this a try.  the wooden packaging looked nice and was sturdy enough that it could be used for storage/transport of the sauces.<br />my brother says that he liked the sauces, he would not share with me on chirstmas day so i never got a chance to try them."
3904,3904,3904,3905,4,"This was a great selection of hot sauces, with a good variety of flavor. Each of the different bottles had a unique taste and each of them had a heat around the same as tabasco sauce. Oh, except for the Dave's Insanity. That will have you pleading for the sweet release of death.<br /><br />But the other sauces are very tasty, and very usable in everyday cooking. Recommended."
3905,3905,3905,3906,5,"For the guy who love to saucethings up, here's the perfect gift and he will love the wooden crate packaging! Great idea and perfect gift :)"
3906,3906,3906,3907,4,"My son loved all the sauces.  The only sauce that was way too hot was the Insanity Sauce, use a teensy tiny bit when using."
3907,3907,3907,3908,5,"I have been searching for hot sauces and peppers to compliment my cuisine and I finally found it. For those of you that don't like everything as Hot as the INSANITY SAUCE, their are others that are less intense in the grouping. For anyone wanting to use these sauces, READ the instructions on the bottles. Good job Dave!!!"

3910,3910,3910,3911,5,"Since the factory burned down that made Firecracker brand pickled sausage I have had to get by with the individually packaged version which doesn't remotely taste like the kind I grew up with, not to mention they are half the size.  These are the best pickled sausages I've had since my last jar of Firecrackers a couple years ago.  I saw the crappy review and I had to show my support.  As a person who grew up on these things I definitely know what I'm talking about.  If you want burn your mouth out hot then look elsewhere but if you want the best tasting pickled sausage on the market currently look no further!"

3912,3912,3912,3913,5,"Everyone who has tried this that I know absolutely loves it. There isn't a lot of heat, but for me that is fine. The flavor is spot on and reminds me of the old fire crackers (before they changed the recipe to dry sticks of meat probably made of orphan kids). I'll definitely will be buying this again. Only downfall is the stupid shipping costs..."
3913,3913,3913,3914,5,These eggs are soo good i think im addicted they are so yummy and i cant eat just one i was very satisfied with this product and it was shipped to me so quick said it would take a week only took 3 DAYS!!! im very pleased and will always buy my goodies from this seller.
3914,3914,3914,3915,5,"These are the best Beer Sausages I,ve come across in decades! They taste just like the old time sausages I used to get in bars when I was younger. If you wont take my word for it just ask 3 of my friends!!"
3915,3915,3915,3916,5,"Was exactly what I was looking for. Super fast shipping! A bit on the spicy side,but great taste!!!!<br />Would definately purchase them again!"
3916,3916,3916,3917,3,"I've been looking for a long time for a beer sausage that was hot to the taste that I use to enjoy back in the Deep South when I was a kid growing up. So far, I've not been able to find the sausage that rang my bell. These arrived quickly and they are tasty and I am glad that I did order these, however, they are not as good as the ones I use to eat when I was in my teens.<br /><br />I gave the product a 3 star rating because they were tasty, but not what I was expecting. I know many of you will enjoy these and you'll probably rate these as a 5 star item, but I must be honest to provide the best rating possible. The 3 stars were for the lack of qualilty in taste. They are not ""hot"" as one is led to believe. Hot makes you sweat, these do not."
3917,3917,3917,3918,5,These sausages have become difficult to find locally.  I was hesitant to purchase these online as they are in glass and are very heavy.  But when there is no other option...  So I ordered 3 jars and they arrived quickly and were extremely well packed.  Not everyone has a taste for the sausages so reviewing that is pointless.  But the company is great to do business with (and they do sell other foods).
3918,3918,3918,3919,1,Tried these the other day because of the low price and regreted it from the moment the jar was opened. These sausages tasted like card board soaked in beef flavored vinegar. Im used to eating Glazier's pickled sausages that snap when you bite them. Guess I will stick to what I like.
3919,3919,3919,3920,2,the product was advertizes as hot sausage;s. the lable on jar say;s [ hot sausage ]. but they not even warm . the sausage;s do have agood flavor but just pickled. we have been serving these type of products at our vfw for year's so i know what i'm talking about.
3920,3920,3920,3921,1,While I gave it the benefit of the doubt confirmation was ascertained on the second bite that it tastes like vomit.
3921,3921,3921,3922,4,"This is good stuff, and hard to find in the local pet stores here in ne pa. One store carries it at times but runs out and at times I send for it through Amazon.com. The price in the stores can be very expensive, and the price through amazon is up in the air as the price fluctuates in the store and the shipping at Amazon adds to the price. I won't discuss price except to say if your dog likes it and is not allergic to it then you have to pay what it cost . My dog has lots of allergies and is not allergic to this so I pay what I pay."
3922,3922,3922,3923,5,"I was nervous after reading some of the reviews about the taste of this and/or quality, but after having been consuming this for a couple days, I really do enjoy it!  Initially I thought it would be gross, but it really wasn't!  It is nice with the fruit in it, and has a kind of ""nutty"" taste. Great shipping, great quality, amazing nprice, and I def. rec!"
3923,3923,3923,3924,4,"Zen brews up to an golden amber liquor. The aroma is sweet spearmint. The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it. Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon. The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion. Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.<br /><br />Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box. A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee. Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter. Four minutes is ample."
3924,3924,3924,3925,5,"Wow, I have to admit these are really yummy. I don't know how they did it, but they don't have that ""imitation-sugar"" taste at all. They're small little bars (slightly bigger than the normal hershey's miniatures), but for only 30 calories a piece, they are a perfect afternoon treat when you need something sweet at the office."
3925,3925,3925,3926,5,"This candy is amazing!  Great tasting chocolate and caramel and still sugar free.  I wish it was for sale locally, but am happy I get a chance to purchase online."
3926,3926,3926,3927,5,"Hershey ""Sugar Free Caramel Filled Chocolates"" are very good diabetic friendly chocolate candies. These are fairly small, but are very tasty.<br /><br />Sweetened with Splenda, these do not significantly impact my blood sugar levels or cause gastric distress.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
3927,3927,3927,3928,4,"If you cannot eat regular chocolate, these are just wonderful.  YUMMY.  For diabetics and people who are choosing not to eat sugar (plus fewer calories) these are very tasty."
3928,3928,3928,3929,5,These chocolates are a welcome find.  They taste the same as regular chocolate but they don't spike my blood sugar.  I treat myself to a couple at a time when I have a sweet tooth.  It's great to be able to satisfy my craving without the extra sugar.  And fortunately the Maltitol doesn't seem to bother my digestive system.<br /><br />They're a little pricey but I found a great bulk deal at another online source.
3929,3929,3929,3930,2,"I ordered this prouct along with 2 others. I bought all together to get the ""FREE SHIPPING over $30"". What really happened is that each item shipped from a different location and I was charged seperate shipping for each. The shipping was such that I could buy these products more cheaply at the corner drug store. I feel I was misled into overbuying and was left feeling ripped off by Amazon. This is the experience I shared with my friends. After this purchase I bought books from Walmart on line for the first time."
3930,3930,3930,3931,5,It was shipped in a very nice package and I have no complain with the seller. My plant growing bigger and now I am looking for a bigger pot to transplant. It's good....if you are looking for a a workspace plant that needs minimal maintenance this is the plant you might need.
3931,3931,3931,3932,5,"cool! I got it last weekend. I was suprised about the pot size, which was a lot bigger than the regular 4"" pots. About the plant, there is nothing to complain.  Within a week, there are already new leaves!"
3932,3932,3932,3933,5,"awesome! I was looking for this particular plant and homedepot/lowes/walmart didnt have any, I ordered it online a little reluctant - my first even plant purchase online, but it is doing great so far! I am happy!"
3933,3933,3933,3934,5,"This is excellent green tea.  It is just a little spicy and very flavorful.  Green tea is so good for you, you won't even miss your morning coffee.  And..... you are helping children when you buy Tea District Children's Tribute tea."
3934,3934,3934,3935,3,"This roasted green tea was only ""so-so"" to my taste. I've found others I like better since I purchased this. However, it arrived in a box of TWELVE boxes (each with 16 or so tea bags). Way too much! Then I found that we can't return food items, so I now have a LOT of tea."
3935,3935,3935,3936,5,"I use this coffee in my espresso maker and all I have to say it WOW!  The espresso is smooth, with a hint of chocolate and slightly bitter finish.  It's the perfect coffee bean for espresso for me.  I hate that strong bitter finish you get with some espresso beans (like starbucks)and you don't get that with this coffee.  I LOVE IT and will be ordering more!"
3936,3936,3936,3937,5,"Best coffee ever. Still haven't found anything I like better. I have never tasted coffee this strong that wasn't bitter at all. Kind of pricey when you start working out what it is costing you per pound but cheaper than buying directly from Gevalia. If this company started opening stores, Starbucks and their bitter brews would go bye bye."
3937,3937,3937,3938,5,"If I drank more than one commuter cup in the morning I'd probably need to back off the caffeine a notch or two, but this espresso (made in my stove-top espresso maker) is delicious and (almost) worth getting out of bed for."
3938,3938,3938,3939,5,A dark coffee that has no bitterness and is smooth as silk. Always use quality filtered water and a clean coffee maker if you want a great brew!
3939,3939,3939,3940,5,I am now on my last box (of three) of this Gevalia Espresso Roast and have been impressed. It does pack a punch like the other reviewer said. One double shot latte of this made in my Aeropress at 9pm keeps me up until a good 2am in the morning. ;)
3940,3940,3940,3941,5,I was given a pack of this coffee as a gift and it had been sitting around for quite a while (over a year) when I decided to try it.  It was without a doubt one of the best coffees that I have tasted.  Very smooth and flavorful.  I would highly recommend this.  After that I ordered a supply from Amazon. They are vacuum packed (I believe much better than store bought coffee).  I may try the decaf version of this to see how that tastes.
3941,3941,3941,3942,5,I love this coffee but I am not sure what has happened to the price lately I used to get this exact product on average for about 15 dollars and the price has skyrocketed to $40.  I am hesitant to buy this product again for this price
3942,3942,3942,3943,5,"This coffee is splendid. I can't say much more. Perfect smoothness, not at all bitter.. just the perfect dark coffee."
3943,3943,3943,3944,5,My husband jut loves this coffee!  I purchased it for him and I actually loved it.  I am a HUGE Starbucks fan but this also does the job for me.  I would highly recommend this product.
3944,3944,3944,3945,5,I bought this for my husband who has been drinking espresso all his life. On a recent trip to Italy we bought the lavazza rosa espresso and I was able to find it and order it on amazon. I bought the gevalia just to try something new and based on the reviews I thought it might be a good idea. My husband loves it and actually prefers it to the Lavazza.  I just bought another 3 pack. we use a stove top Bialetti and this is fine for that type of maker. Highly recommend!!!
3945,3945,3945,3946,5,"I have been ordering Koeze nuts over 20 years now.  The quality is as good now as they were when I was given my first jar.  I gave these to my son in law the first christmas we spent together and when he opened them his comment was ""these are wallhangers"".  They really are the best nuts I've ever had.  Enjoy!!!"
3946,3946,3946,3947,5,THE NUTS WERE FRESH. THE CONTAINER WAS FINE FOR THE PRICE. BECAUSE OF THE QUANTITY THAT I ORDERED THE FREIGHT WAS MARGINAL.
3947,3947,3947,3948,5,Koeze Colossal Cashews are most delicious  cashews I have ever tasted and they are HUGE.<br />They aren't kidding when they call them jumbo.  They  are so very flavorful.<br /> Order these and you won't be disappointed<br />(expect you'll wish you had ordered a larger size).
3948,3948,3948,3949,5,"These cashews were what I was hoping for, they were large and very fresh. They met my expectations I recommend Koeze for anyone looking to purchase these especially if they are a gift. I was not disappointed."
3949,3949,3949,3950,5,"I keep these on hand for car trips with the grandkids. You can turn a boring bottle of water into a flavorful Kool-Aid drink by just adding a single packet to it. Just open the bottle, pour in the contents of one packet, then close and shake. Each packet contains both the Kool-Aid mix and the amount of sugar that's needed for a single drink. Perfect size for a typical water bottle. We use reusable watter bottles with them, so we can fill them up with water when ever we need something to drink and then add the Kool-Aid.<br /><br />They taste just like when you mix a regular full sized pitcher of Kool-Aid, just in a single serving size. These single servings work really well for us since we never drink a whole pitcher when me make one, and end up pouring half of it out. These were such a great idea!"
3950,3950,3950,3951,3,"...however, for the price and additional shipping cost (if not receiving that free), I would not say this is a such a good value. Not sure what makes the tuna more pricey than something like the freeze-dried salmon. If these were the only treats available to the cats, they likely would not last even one week in this small amount. In the future, I'd be more apt to open up a 69-cent can of tuna, which they are just as fine with."
3951,3951,3951,3952,3,"The tea was a lot milder in flavor than I was expecting, but still pleasant. The aroma was light. I probably would not buy this again, but that's only because I would like a more intense flavor."
3952,3952,3952,3953,5,"I have fallen in love with this tea. I am a british tea fanatic and Ashby's has superceded my tastes and expectations. Smooth, not to bitter, low tannins awesome taste! I'll take this over PG Tips!"
3953,3953,3953,3954,5,The packaging is so cute on all of Ashby's teas and the tea is exceptional. I would recommend this tea to anyone.
3954,3954,3954,3955,4,"If you have dry skin, give this a try. A doctor recommended I try this when I complained of itchy skin due to dryness. It's definitely more moisturizing than the bar soaps I used to use.<br /><br />As someone already mentioned, the packaging design is horrible. I used to keep almost empty bottles propped upside-down in my shower caddy, but then decided to use a pump bottle instead, which I refill.<br /><br />Dove -<br />If you're reading this, please redesign these bottles so that they are more user-friendly. In Japan, you sell liquid Dove soap in pump bottles, and you even sell refills packaged in plastic bag, which are far more eco-friendly and less expensive. Please consider doing the same for the North American market."
3955,3955,3955,3956,5,"Yeah, I'm a guy. Just because I'm a guy doesn't mean I can't want smooth, hydrated skin. I bought this stuff on a whim. I love it! The scent is light, so as not to overpower. And it does make you feel a little cooler, as well as hydrated. I am no longer dry and itchy after a shower! I combined this stuff with a bodyscrub brush...WOW!"
3956,3956,3956,3957,2,"I love the product.  But, the bottle design is terrible.  In order to get the last 1/3 or so of the body wash out of the bottle in a timely manner you would normally store the bottle upside down.  With the pointy top that is impossible.  So, you must stand in the shower the try to shake the remaining product the length of the bottle to squirt it out.  This takes much more time that you'll want it to take.  Redesign the bottle with a flat top...please."
3957,3957,3957,3958,5,"I'm a guy with hairy arms and hairy legs. Until I found this stuff, I was using various other body washes with my loofah. I always felt like I could never get enough suds and that the application seemed rough and difficult to quickly spread the body wash all over. Since I started using this stuff (for a few years now), I haven't looked back. This stuff is nice and soft and can create a decent amount of suds with somewhat minimal amounts of application on the loofah. It goes on smooth and ends up making my skin nice and smooth. And it rinses off nice, without leaving my skin rough. It works well, has a nice subtle smell, and I won't use anything else."
3958,3958,3958,3959,5,I ordered personal items for the first time from Amazon and I was very satisfied.  The product came shipped securely and the description of the product matched perfectly.  I will order again going forward.  Amazon has not disappointed yet.  I love the DOVE Body Wash!  It smells very fresh and clean and really keeps the skin moisturized well.  I have combination skin.
3959,3959,3959,3960,5,"This was a great bargain, worked out cheaper than if I had purchased them at a wholesale discount store plus it was elegible for free shipment...BONUS"
3960,3960,3960,3961,5,My wife uses this and she has no complains. It makes her smell nice and clean and it foams well. great moisturizer inside. I personally don't care for it because it feels slimy on my skin after use. I guess that is the moisturizer working. Very good smell though.
3961,3961,3961,3962,5,"I just started using this product so I think it is too soon to rate; however, the order arrived very quickly."
3962,3962,3962,3963,5,"High quality body wash that is very thick and lathers quickly and easily. It has a very pleasant, flowery smell that lasts for hours after you get out of the shower. You only have to use a small amount about the size of a quarter to last your entire shower. So even though the product is expensive, you will get a lot of use out of it. It seems that the cheaper, dollar a bottle kind I sometimes use only lasts a week or 2 because I have to use more of the product to last throughout a shower.<br /><br />I would say the smell lasts for around 6 hours or so so it's almost like perfume. My sister-in-law asked me yesterday, ""You always smell so good. What do you wear?"" I wasn't wearing any perfume of any kind at the time because it was very early in the morning before I had done my morning routine and I had to run something over there to her. I told her that it must just be the body wash. If you have ever used Dove shampoo or conditioners, it is almost the same smell.<br /><br />I am looking forward to trying the cucumber/green tea kind when I run out of these 4 bottles. I would totally recommend this for yourself or for any woman in your life: aunt, mother, girlfriend, wife. I know many women who would never buy this Dove product because they always choose their children and families over themselves, ie buying themselves whatever is cheapest. I intend on buying some of this for my mom and aunt to maybe put in a gift basket or care package for them.<br /><br />I also use this as bubble bath when I take a nice hot bath. Excellent product. A+ from me."
3963,3963,3963,3964,5,I love this body wash.  It leaves my skin feeling very soft.  It's not greasy either.  Worth the extra money to buy the real stuff.
3964,3964,3964,3965,5,"Great product and great scheduled deliveries.  I get it for my youngest son, who lives in a group home. Not sure what they do with it all, but at least he's clean!"
3965,3965,3965,3966,5,Very pleased this stuff smells so good. My roommies LOVE to sniff the shower after ive been in there. the first one got lost in the mail but customer service sent me a second one and upgraded to overnight delivery. So it gets 5 stars from me.
3966,3966,3966,3967,5,i bought this -4 pack of dove deep wash and three months later i am still using it.<br />i dont think i could use any other product.
3967,3967,3967,3968,4,"I LOVE this body wash!  It smells nice, works great, and feels great on your skin.  Add in the fact that with the Subscribe and Save deal, it is a great value, I'm sold!"
3968,3968,3968,3969,5,"yes, i have bought this before. i like the smell and detest the bottle design. i do agree with one of the reviewers that the Dove does sell their liquid soaps in pump form in Asian countries and sell the refills for them as well. i would like it if they have that... but i must make due with what i CAN get at this point in time.<br /><br />i decided to redo the way i do my bath routine the way i currently do is so time consuming. it takes almost an hour to take a shower.<br />so i'm on amazon finding things to aid in my new innovated routine.<br /><br />like i said before, i have bought this product in Walmart but only the single bottles or double bottles that happened to be on sale. i love the product it makes me feel soft and silky. the scent is pleasant. not over powering at all. light.<br /><br />i don't buy lotion, they're often heavy and make me feel greasy or they feel weird on my skin. i am of the chocolate complexion so i tend to get extremely ashy because i don't like the way i feel after putting on lotion, so i buy dove body wash, deep moisture. i get clean, moisturized and don't feel greasy after i get out the shower.<br /><br />**EdIt!**<br /><br />i have solved the oddly shaped bottle problem, buy or find one lying around the house, a soap pump for hand soap.<br />i recommend the ones that have had hand soap in them as they are conditioned for everyday use and can hold a thicker capacity soap like this the manufacturer had the bottles made specifically for their product, their product is thick. i've read and heard that the ones you buy empty are for thin lotions and what not.<br /><br />if you use an old soap bottle clean it out first and fill with the Dove soap, and use in the shower, if you can find a 24 oz bottle (maybe from one of doves hair pumps rinsed out,) they're 25oz, big enough to fit all of it and strong enough for thick products such as this. (25oz eliminates the frustrating last bit at the bottom, anything smaller store the remaining in a drawer in the corner upside down so you can squeeze the rest in the bottle without fighting with it too much, by the time you get to that second half in the bottle it'll be where you want it and you don't come out the shower looking like you got into a fight with a Dove Soap Deep Moistruizing Body wash bottle...  XD"
3969,3969,3969,3970,4,"Both my husband and I use this body wash.  We both have dry skin and feels it does a really good job as a moisturizing body wash.  It is a little pricey here, basically comparable to store prices (Walmart/Supermarket).  I order for convenience, one less item I have to waste time at a store getting---with our busy lives it is needed so we tend to get many items from Amazon, mostly through the Subscribe and Save program."
3970,3970,3970,3971,5,Great for stocking up and keeping a few in the closet. I like to buy things in bulk and this was a good deal and smells good too.
3971,3971,3971,3972,5,"I use this product every time I shower and it is great. I usually get horribly dry skin in the winter but this along with Dove lotion keeps my skin soft and smooth! the smell is good, not overwhelming and you get ALOT of product, the bottle is HUGE. Very comparable to department store body washes (I have Kiehls, chanel, and Shiseido) except a lot more affordable."
3972,3972,3972,3973,5,"Needed the soap b-4 weekend. Ordered on Thurs and paid the extra next day shipping (even though I'm Prime) because no delivery here on Sat). Stuff came s promised on Friday and in good package. The price of the soap, like lots of other stuff nowadays on Amazon, was higher than local stores so ck prices first. Amazon aint the lowest, usually, anymore."
3973,3973,3973,3974,1,"I will never understand the soaps from mainstream, and sometimes otherwise great brands, who claim to have a line of ""sensitive skin"" products which still contain Sodium Lauryl or Laureth (as in this case) Sulfate. If you're someone who needs sensitive skin products there's a more than decent chance that you also need stuff without SLS. Boo. Refer to their bar soap, which is wonderful."
3974,3974,3974,3975,1,This product gave me a horrible rash.  It contains both soybean oil and fragrance which are allergens.  They need to list allergens.
3975,3975,3975,3976,5,"I like the item or I would not have ordered it, However, I ordered 100 and 100 was confirmed. When the order arrived it contained only 96, four short. Rather skimpy. I usually like to receive what I ordered and for which I paid full price."
3976,3976,3976,3977,1,"I don't enjoy giving products a bad review but I was so disappointed I had to.  I've tried quite a few teas and I've been able to drink teas that others say taste like dirty dish water so I can get down some pretty harsh teas.  I usually don't use any type of sweeteners either because I drink my tea right before bed.  I've tried to give this tea a chance.  Ive tried it with sugar, honey and lemon and masking the flavor with vanilla and a little milk.  To me, this tea smells like dirty feet and probably tastes like them too.  I've also tried straight chamomile teas before too so I know it's not that.  I would rather eat the plant itself than drink this tea.  I haven't tried any other Twinings products so this review is strictly for this product."
3977,3977,3977,3978,5,"This tea is what it is supposed to be, it is good, the packaging was good, and the tea is excellent"
3978,3978,3978,3979,5,I've been using Lourdes Chimichurri for years - The stuff is awesome. I use it mostly when cooking fish but have recently started to put it in my family's sandwiches. We're also big fans of the guava and mango spreads. Highly recommend these products if you're looking for great taste without the preservatives.
3979,3979,3979,3980,5,"I started using <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008EMA3AS"">Lourdes Gourmet Chimichurri Sauce</a> on my grilled steaks and fell in love with it.  Now I'm putting it on my chicken, vegetables & pasta.  I'm turning into a real chimichurri addict."
3980,3980,3980,3981,5,"I absolutely love this product!  I use it on chicken, beef and as veggie spread! Its also good in recipe's for a little extra kick!"
3981,3981,3981,3982,5,"I was introduced to the Blair chips by a friend. I mostly ignore potato chips because I really don't like them. However, these I like the most among all the chips in the Blair line. They are savory and can be eaten rapidly. The hot chips are good because they are so hot, I cannot eat them fast. I am so happy I cannot get them at local stores because I would eat them all the time."
3982,3982,3982,3983,5,These cashews are the best I've ever had and the containers they come in are the perfect size.
3983,3983,3983,3984,2,"SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU'RE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO HUNGRY PEOPLE,<br /><br />What's in Kellogg's Corn Flakes? ""Milled Corn, Sugar, Malt Flavoring, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Salt."" Yes, of course, it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as BHT and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities. For nutrition you get basically 100% Carbs from lots of SUGAR and almost NO PROTEIN. Add skim milk, or you'll get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk. For added nutrition, include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germ.<br /><br />If you like Corn Flakes, that is your business and you should enjoy them, but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than 0.29 cents an ounce [$3.49 per package]. At this price, the inner package's failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish 12 ounces of this stuff. Why not use a vacuum-sealed container like Kretschmer's Wheat Germ to preserve freshness? After all, it's in the same price range!<br /><br />So if you are hungry, you are really eating the wrong stuff. SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU ARE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO OTHER HUNGRY PEOPLE PLEASE!"
3984,3984,3984,3985,1,"It saddens me to say I had to return this item.  The item's page specifically said the Calamares were packed in Olive Oil.  However on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oil....an unhealthy oil.  That was the bad news.  The good news is Amazon, as usual, was gracious and professional in allowing me to return this item which is considered to be 'not returnable'.  That is why I buy everything online from Amazon.com.  They are the best."
3985,3985,3985,3986,4,The content has been consistantly good. The calamares have been tasty. The price was also very reasonable
3986,3986,3986,3987,3,"Watch out for this because I wanted what was pictures however I got different colored flowers.  They use local vendors and it depends on what they have in stock.  The flowers still looked beautiful, but I was expecting the white and pink flowers.  My wife got orange and yellows one instead."
3987,3987,3987,3988,5,"At my local Costco store, I bought Pace salsa numerous times. The salsa tastes feel rich and I love the jalepenos Pace puts in the salsa. Spicy, but not too the point where I'm sweating and can't enjoy my salsa and chips.<br /><br />The salsa doesn't feel watered down and this is a great ""go to"" salsa choice."
3988,3988,3988,3989,5,"I have a husband who could bathe in Pace picante salsa, I wish amazon would put it on their subscribe and save program. I ordered two bottles and during shipment one of the lids broke and salsa went everywhere. Amazon immediately gave me my money back, I'm surprised my husband didn't eat the salsa soaked box for dinner."
3989,3989,3989,3990,5,"The sodium and sugar (often corn syrup) in tomato sauces is frightening.  Plus, w/them you eat white pasta to boot but w/salsa you eat rice and beans.  Trust me - don't buy your sauces around your meals, get salsa and plan meals around it.<br /><br />They arrived in a day or two and the bottles were shiny and fresh, I was afraid of warehouse dust and old stock.  The vendor did really well."
3990,3990,3990,3991,5,These are really great tasting cookies. I like the combination of peanut butter and chocolate. A nice change from the usual chocolate chip cookies.
3991,3991,3991,3992,5,"These arrived fresh and in very good shape, Just like buying from the local store only cheaper and delivered to my door!"
3992,3992,3992,3993,5,"I was looking for snacks to buy in bulk for school lunches and this fit the bill perfectly.  It helped that my 7 year old loves Chips Ahoy, but for convenience alone, this was a great purchase since I have free shipping through Amazon Prime."
3993,3993,3993,3994,5,"The Price is great, The serving is just right for a snack, and ITS A COOKIE. Buy a bunch and they send it to your house!!"
3994,3994,3994,3995,2,"These bags never close well, so if you are a compulsive bag-closer, forget about it. Ah, the taste you ask? Dry, and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form. Snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews. And why, oh, why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure-ish stickers on the back of their vehicle? Please, just go straight for the original ""Chips Ahoy!"" in standard size, pig out, and forget about the kids for six minutes."
3995,3995,3995,3996,4,"These cookies are both yummy and well priced. I recommend them. Other cookies I like are Mrs. Fields(packaged), Chips ahoy soft baked, fig newtons, oreos, and elf cookies."
3996,3996,3996,3997,5,"This is not a gourmet chocolate chip cookie, but is the best chocolate chip cookie that we have found in the grocery store. It is not too firm or soft, has a good amount of flavorful chocolate chips, and makes for a nice snack or dessert. We have eaten these for years in my house."
3997,3997,3997,3998,4,"It's a lot of cookies, but the price is very good compared to the local grocery store.  The packages were in good shape and the cookies were fresh.  My order from January 25th has an expiration date of April 28th.  Not bad, but I would have preferred a later expiration date.  Other than that, no problems.  Exactly the same Chips Ahoy you would buy in the store."
3998,3998,3998,3999,4,"Delicious cookies.  I actually thought I was ordering the white chocolate chunk cookies, not the chewy, but definitely enjoyed these.  The only down side, is these seem awfully small."
3999,3999,3999,4000,5,Exactly what I wanted...individual packages of cookies that I couldn't find at a store.  Shipping was only 99cents and came to be in about 3 days.<br /><br />It was great!
4000,4000,4000,4001,5,"I really like the ""crunchy"" chocolate chip cookies . . . the soft ones are chemically softened and, I think, gross.  These have good flavor and are great for trips (although eating anything crunchy in the car is discouraged . . . wait for a rest stop!) and especially for preschooler snacks."
4001,4001,4001,4002,5,"I have a bit of a sweet tooth. I've tried to ignore it in times past, but the reality is that I want--NEED--a cookie from time-to-time as a welcome addition to my brown bag lunch. These 1.4 ounce single servings make that easy without overdoing it. If I bring one with me I know I'll only end up eating one package and not HALF of a 12 ounce package! Single servings help keep the portion size healthy while not killing your soul by ignoring your need for some desert...<br /><br />Reasonably priced and shipped to your door, these are a great purchase."
4002,4002,4002,4003,1,I did not know that I was ordering biscuit crumbs. That is exactly what I received. Such a lousy product. It's Amazon's fault for shipping out expires products. Will NEVER order food from Amazon.com ever.
4003,4003,4003,4004,3,"I meant to pick up the normal Chewy Chips Ahoy and was flabbergasted when I returned home to find that they shoved the word ""oatmeal"" in the corner of the package but kept everything else the same. I decided to try them anyway and the oats definitely interrupt the normally wonderful chemistry between the chocolate and dough.<br />[...]"
4004,4004,4004,4005,2,"Chips Ahoy, chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it breaking into pieces.  My tastebuds say they are too sweet, not cooked enough, lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes.  If you like cookie dough, you most likely will enjoy these.  I'll stick with a crunchy, less sweet cookie."
4005,4005,4005,4006,5,"Wow.  So far, two two-star reviews.  One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.<br /><br />These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of ""calms"" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.<br /><br />Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not ""crispy"" cookies, or the blurb would say ""crispy,"" rather than ""chewy.""  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.<br /><br />So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.  If you want a cookie that's soft, chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal, give these a try.  I'm here to place my second order."
4006,4006,4006,4007,1,"When I eat junk food, I'd like to enjoy it, the guilty pleasure it is.<br /><br />These cookies are neither healthy or tasty.  Stick to Chewy Chocolate Chip cookies."
4007,4007,4007,4008,1,tastes pretty crappy. it's like raw cookies.<br /><br />it's not even like a cookie. it's a squishy thing in a cookie shape
4008,4008,4008,4009,2,"I purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies. Wrong! I like chocolate chip and I like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just don't work well together. I wish I had read the item listing more carefully. Even my kids said ""Blech!""."
4009,4009,4009,4010,1,"After eating TANG's chocolate and double-chocolate cookies, all other cookies will taste like expired, tepid dogfood to you. Her cookies will enhance your life in ways you never dreamed possible. Tim Horton's, Timothy's, Second Cup, Starbucks, Treats and those horrid packaged cookies at Zupas are just pathetic imitators to the grandeur that is a TANG cookie. HER COOKIES ARE DA BOMB!!! A+++++++ Hawt damn!"
4010,4010,4010,4011,1,"Overall I was not happy with the crumbiness of these cookies. They were way to fragile and crumby. There is just too many crumbs in my bed, how am I supposed to sleep like this?"
4011,4011,4011,4012,4,"Sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank. I like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are, and high in omega fats. The skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinion--regular sardines taste a bit too oily, fishy, and strong to me. They are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatile--I sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling, mix with egg, oatmeal, onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty, or add them to a salad. Although I think these from Roland are very good, I liked the Seasons skinless sardines, which are also sold by Amazon, even better for flavor and texture."
4012,4012,4012,4013,4,"This is a very tasty product. Tastes more like tuna. However I believe the 35mg of salt listed on the indgredients for a 1/4 cup serving is much lower than the actual salt content. I use very little salt and these are somewhat salty. I also opened a can of Crown Prince natural brisling sardines in water which has a salt content of about 45 mg. The crown prince tasted much less salty than the Roland sardines. So I think Roland needs to be a little more careful about their packaging and list of ingredients. My guess is the salt content is comparable to a can of water packed tuna, maybe 210 mg or higher per 1/4 cup serving."
4013,4013,4013,4014,3,Skinless sardines in water differ from the ones with skin in oil in that they are somewhat coarse and dense as opposed to the softer texture of sardines in oil.  Not much fishy odor and the liquid is flavorful.
4014,4014,4014,4015,5,"I like this product much better than the canned sardines I am able to find at my local grocery stores.  I buy Rolland and Seasons ( both sold by Amazon ) and in my opinion they are superior in both taste and texture.  It is a toss up for me as to skinned and boneless opposed to the skin on with bones - I like both - there are probally more nutrients in the ones with bones, which, along with the omega 3s is the plus factor for sardines.  They work for me.  I have eaten them since I  was a kid - I'll turn 80 in July. Incidentally, my cat is crazy about them too."
4015,4015,4015,4016,5,"Sardines are rising in popularity as people discover more about their health benefits... and that they aren't so stinky after all (especially less so after cooking!).<br /><br />I've used numerous varieties of the Roland sardines: olive oil, s&b in olive oil, tomato sauce, etc.  The S&B version with low sodium and packed in water is my best recommendation/preference: a great value for the money, and practically a steal when you compare -per ounce- the price with other brands.  Then, consider the discount(s) when purchasing through Amazon, and it'll be tough to choose another.  Why?  Many other brands charge the same price as -or more than Roland- with only a 3.5-oz tin, whereas Roland includes more fish in the tin.  The quality is consistent, and the sardines themselves are quite succulent and versatile enough to be included in stir-fries, salads, pasta dishes, etc. without overpowering the other flavors.<br /><br />Oddly enough, I was half-mindful when perusing a semi-local dollar store which is renowned for carrying a ton of food items in my city.  I was looking to make some lower-cost and healthier choices in my diet at the time (not expecting to find these, of course, but rather turning my nose up at the usual crud I saw stocked there) when I accidentally stumbled across them.  At $1 per tin, it was a huge buy, so I tried a few.  The rest, as they say, is history as aforementioned."
4016,4016,4016,4017,5,"Just had my 1st can of these sardines and I am delighted!  Big sardines in the can with a most excellent mild flavor.  Made a tuna salad...but used sardines.  Wonderful!  I have to say that I really didn't notice that they were low sodium as far as affecting the overall sardine taste.  Love the ones without oil as I don't really like that greasy fish taste you get with some sardines.  I just got diagnosed with hypothyroidism, and I read that sardines are good to help restore your thryoid function.  I'll be ordering more of these!"
4017,4017,4017,4018,5,"Roland S&B sardines are the best you can buy and believe me,  I've tried them all.  ALSO....Amazon's price is half what I had been paying."
4018,4018,4018,4019,5,"After the doc said cut the salt, and tuna is expensive and pyekky with no sodium, and of little health benefit, I've been looking for eitzehs.<br />No salt?  Tasteless food?  I'll be a misery!~<br />I took this product, added some lemon juice and sprayed on some liquid smoke from an atomizer bottle I comanddered for the occasion, mished it up, and it tastes great on a matzah!~<br />I can even extend it a little bit by adding some shredded lettuce to the mix, and it is my fave breakfast!<br />Low sodium means getting creative.<br />Mustard, balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, worchestershire sauce and liquid smoke have been staples for replacing salt, though none comes close.<br />If you have another salt replacement ingredient to add, PLEASE! Put a reply here!<br />Thanks! Bitayavon!"
4019,4019,4019,4020,5,Water based sardines without salt is.... awwfuul.  Not bad of a product here--far superior to the types I normally purchase at stores.
4020,4020,4020,4021,5,"I love canned sardines and when they put me on a low salt diet<br />I figured that was the end of my sardines until I found these. They taste fantastic,the price is reasonable and you can at least have<br />something that before these sardines was not available to people<br />on a low salt diet. Side benefits as they are skinless and boneless.<br />Thanks to the Roand Co."
4021,4021,4021,4022,5,"these are really good, the sodium is ok based upon the daily allowance. It is a great fast meal when you do not want to cut on the stove and it is really good when added to a salad. so far the  low fat sardines has aided me in my weight loss, I am going to continue Roland's product until I reach my final goal weight. They taste good, a litte coarse and dry but I normally add the juice to a fork full. I love them. I learned not to be too critical and enjoy the little things in life."
4022,4022,4022,4023,5,I've eaten a lot of sardines in my life and by far these are the best. The extra cost of boneless/skinless is worth it cos there is more to eat and less waste.  Love the water packed instead of the gooeyness of oil. Excellent
4023,4023,4023,4024,4,"4.5. Just water and large pieces of sardines. Open for all types of combinations of which I find the old whole grain crackers, quality cheese, a particle of mayo and mustard and a hot cup of tea, the most appealing. They do lunch in a hurry and snack times as well. Solid product. Even drank the water in which they are laid to rest and not too shabby. Sardines are good for a person, everyone agrees on that. Even a Sardine sandwich sounds about right in the next few minutes (the better the bread the better the sandwich...) so yes, 4 Solid Stars and I am hungry for the product right now, come to think of it!"
4024,4024,4024,4025,5,The product arrived on time and is delicious. Thanks very much. The price was very fair. What else needs to be said?
4025,4025,4025,4026,5,"I buy skinless sardines packed in water to keep my intake of sodium and chloresterol down.  For about $2 a can including tax and delivery I feel I am getting my money's worth.  I cannot get these kinds of sardines at the local supermarket.<br /><br />Sardines are somewhat tasteless.  I put the sardines on salad and top the salad with olive oil and red wine vinegar.  If I eat the sardines as a sandwich, I used mustard, which also has no salt and chloresterol."
4026,4026,4026,4027,5,I have had to change my diet and now have better health. These are very tasty.
4027,4027,4027,4028,5,"I've tried many brands of sardines. These are my favorite. Even with low sodium, they are full of flavor. Excellent choice."
4028,4028,4028,4029,4,"These are the best skinless boneless sardines that I've tried and they are very reasonably priced.  They remind me a little more of tuna fish than sardines, but in a mild, rather than bad, way and are very firm for water-packed fish.  I especially like these mixed with salsa. They work out to $1.57/can or .36/oz if you choose the longer, but free, shipping."
4029,4029,4029,4030,4,I'm on a very low sodium intake- 300mgs per day- and these are great. Good taste and low sodium. I just put a little mustard on them and yum!
4030,4030,4030,4031,4,"This is a favorite chocolate bar of several family members, made so by a visit to Germany. Hard to find in the States. Glad to know where to get them."
4031,4031,4031,4032,5,"Yum!  I could live off of this stuff.  The peach flavor is refreshing and delicious. It's no longer sold where I live, and I really miss it.  (Can't even get it from Amazon.)  It's just too good to be discontinued."
4032,4032,4032,4033,4,"I usually find the citrus sodas too tart/acidic for my tastes, and I find the black cherry Fresca too cloyingly sweet. I LOVE the peach; it's so crisp and refreshing without being acidic, and is just the right sweet for me. Other than ginger ale, it's my favorite ""white"" soda. I have been having trouble finding this in the grocery, and really hope it hasn't been discontinued."
4033,4033,4033,4034,5,"I was looking for a low calorie cocktail and mixed a Rose wine with the Fresca Peach and it was delicious and I am not a regualar soda drinker and don't normally drink Rose wine. Make sure to get a Rose that is not sweet or you might as well drink Kool-aid. Look for off-dry or bone dry Rose's, maybe made with a Syrah, Cabernet, Merlot, Tempranillo, Sangiovese. Zinfandels tend to be too sweet for my taste, but you might like it. A sparkling rose would be great too. You can serve this with ice in a cocktail glass  or without ice in a martini glass."
4034,4034,4034,4035,5,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT. ID DOES WHAT IT SAYS, IT WILL BRING SHINE AND HEALTH TO YOUR PETS COAT, AND THE DOGS LOVE IT."
4035,4035,4035,4036,5,"I was looking for a healthy alternative to regular wheat grass which is becoming harder to find in health stores... and this is not just for me! I also grow this in trays for my 2 cats who live indoors, deprived of valuable natural chlorophyll. All mammals need it, and we are now enjoying a strong, healthy organically grown variety which is easy to grow and lasts a long time. Wheat grass has larger blades than lawn grass which does not induce the cats to being sick. They crave it and are very healthy with glossy soft coats, their energy levels are better, and they are playing more. Both are perfectly healthy. Chlorophyll is kind of like eating liquid sunshine mixed in with vegetation. It does a body good! If you care about your (or other) bodies, then get this very nice product. The shipping is fast and it is packaged well. The cans are sealed well with a tight-fitting lid. Yes, I am going to continue ordering from this vendor again. They have exactly what I am looking for."
4036,4036,4036,4037,5,"I wanted to give these soy crisps more justice than just the 5 stars (and ordering them all the time).  I bought a bag of these Sea Salt flavor crisps and a bag of BBQ crisps about a month ago, in a bid to eat more healthy food.  I've always loved BBQ chips, especially Ruffles and Lays K.C. Masterpiece chips, but they've got to be killing me slowly, right?  So I busted open the BBQ soy crisps and gagged.  How could this be BBQ?  They tasted like cardboard, and I gave them to my friends who will eat anything.  I begrudgingly opened the Sea Salt bag, and though more palatable, I was still disappointed.  (I know...""I thought you said 5 stars.""  It gets better.)<br /><br />Anyway, I had sworn off chips and midday snacking, so for two weeks I saw nothing on the counter but Genisoy Soy Crisps.  I'd eat two or three here and there, and when I ran out, I bought 2 bags of the Sea Salt flavor again.  What happened must be akin to rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drive--my body forgot what those strong BBQ flavored chips were like, and I started craving Soy Crisps.  I began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor, like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars, which I had completely missed before, apparently because it wasn't a sweet, red-crusted, overbearing BBQ powder.  I polished the next bags off in three days.<br /><br />Now, I'm ordering 12 here on Amazon ($1 cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to punish my wallet for trying to eat healthy food).  My advice is this--give these soy crisps a chance, but don't mix them in with your regular Doritos and BBQ Ruffles or you'll think they're awful.  Stop eating, for a month, the oily BBQ chips that have deadened your taste buds for years and reboot your taste buds with these markedly healthier chips.  You'll feel better about snacking!"
4037,4037,4037,4038,5,"I found out about these from a co-worker. They are delicious, low calorie, and pack some protein. Eating these rather than my usual pretzels and chips helped me slim down. I get them by the case now from Amazon since it is a better buy (and my supermarket doesn't always carry them)."
4038,4038,4038,4039,5,"For people watching weight or nutrition,these chips are an excellent substitute for regular chips.  They have plenty of protein as well.<br />Amazon's price is much cheaper than buying packs at the local grocery store."
4039,4039,4039,4040,5,"I love light crispy salty snacks, and Soy Crisps is the best one of those I've found.  At only 100 calories per serving/350 calories for the bag, you could literally eat the entire bag (which I do on a regular basis) and not feel bad about it.<br /><br />There are several flavors but Deep Sea Salt is my favorite because it is subtle and just enhances the natural flavor of the rice and soy.<br /><br />So delish!  Shipped fast with all crisps in tact.  Great purchase, re-ordering."
4040,4040,4040,4041,4,"These are one of my favorite ways to eat grains  Plus they are a good source of protein.  17 chips per serving is just about right.  I wish they had a little less salt but for the calorie/fat/fiber content, they are pretty healthy.  Great with soup or salads or just plain.  I would definitely recommend these."
4041,4041,4041,4042,5,"Just the same thing I use to buy in the stores but for less. Same great taste, same great package. same eveything because it is the exact same thing, Love is stuff. thanks"
4042,4042,4042,4043,5,"I am a huge fan of Genisoy Soy Crisps (Deep Sea Salted flavor).<br />I love the crunch and texture of this non-greasy snack.  The flavor is subtle and very light.  No heavy salty taste or greasy lips or fingers after eating.  I also like that I can really indulge on these and not feel the regret of eating too many calories.  Soy Crisps are my fav crunchy treat.  >^,,^&lt;"
4043,4043,4043,4044,4,"I love this flavor of Soy Crisps...Deep Sea Salted. However, they are not available in the smaller individual size like most of the other flavors are. My husband prefers the lightly salted ones because they are crispier that the sea salted ones. He's right, but I do like this softer crunch too. It sort of reminds me of popcorn. In fact, I don't mind the big bag on occasions...for example if it is a replacement for a big bag of popcorn while watching a movie! What a nice healthy treat!"
4044,4044,4044,4045,4,"I'm a big fan of the carbs, fat and protein balance of these crisps. The salt isn't overpowering and the taste is OK. I've had better soy chips (Genisoy Tortilla Chips) but these are alright if you don't like the crunch of a chip."
4045,4045,4045,4046,5,"Stores are not carrying this product - thank goodness I can still get them!!!!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CMHMUC"">Genisoy Soy Crisps, Deep Sea Salted, 3.85-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>"
4046,4046,4046,4047,5,"I love these soy crisps.  They are the perfect salty crunch.  I have a hard time finding snack foods that don't have wheat, corn, or some sort of sugar sweetener in them.  But these fit the bill.  They are *very* salty, tho. I like them that way, but if you're not used to it and can be kindof surprising."
4047,4047,4047,4048,5,"These soy crisps are an excellent choice for snacking. With 7 grams of protein in each serving, they are SO much better for you than potato chips or other snack foods.They have a great flavor, just enough salt, and leave you feeling satisfied -nutritionally and snackwise ! My grandchildren know these crisps are what they will be offered at my house for snacking. I highly recommend them."
4048,4048,4048,4049,5,"I recently found out that I am allergic to wheat and milk.  As you can imagine, this severely limits my snacking options.  My local grocery was clearancing all of their organic section, so I tried these.  They are SO GOOD!  I love salted & plain rice cakes (did before my diet change too) & these add an extra punch of flavor and crunch!  Yum!"
4049,4049,4049,4050,5,"I have a very bad habit of snacking that I can't get rid of. So I purchased this to make snacking a little less bad. The first time I tried it I was like UGH it's gross! But soon it started to grow on me. It's very crispy, without being a deep fried potato chip. It's lightly salted, and doesn't have 12 different fattening, unhealthy seasonings and flavorings. One entire bag is only like 350 calories. It's actually quite good. I really like it now, and I find myeslf reaching for a bag of GenSoy before any type of chip."
4050,4050,4050,4051,4,"These are the most consistent soy crisps I have had. They are light, flavorful, and always fresh - and usually arrive in very good condition (not crumbs). They are a bit salty, but that's the only point that might be bad - just depends on what you're expecting."
4051,4051,4051,4052,5,"These soy crisps are very filling and satisfying.  If you are looking for something with a great salty crunch, these are for you.<br /><br />They are high in fiber and protein, and that is great if you are trying to watch your calorie intake.<br /><br />I think they are great and recommend them highly."
4052,4052,4052,4053,5,"I really love these snacks.  They are low in calories and fat while being high in protein, which is important to me because I am a vegetarian."
4053,4053,4053,4054,1,I have been purchasing this product for about 9 months.  The taste of the product is inconsistent from lot number to lot number. I have gotten 3 cases where the chips had no flavor at all.  Have contacted the manufacturer 2 times.  Have not received a response from my latest inquiry. I don't recommend purchasing.
4054,4054,4054,4055,1,"I bought these because I had decided I wanted to eat, and even snack, healthier.  These had so many good reviews, so I decided to try them.  I admit, it was a big mistake to order a whole stupid case without trying them first.  When I opened them, they looked totally unappetizing and then I tasted them......it tasted just like a rice cake/styrofoam with salt on it.  They also have a very unusual texture.  The combination of taste and texture was very disappointing.  My teenage daughter tried them and felt the same way - not even the dog would eat them.  We tried them with a variety of dips and couldn't come up with a tolerable way to choke them down.<br /><br />Luckily, I have a niece that is newly vegetarian, hungry all the time, and she took these off my hands.  I am still out $25 for buying the case of these to begin with...what a waste!"
4055,4055,4055,4056,1,"The product that I received was not the product that was pictured and described on the item's page.  The worst part of it all was that when I attempted to return the case of ""Soy Crisps"", I was unable to do so.  Amazon said that this was a non-refundable item.  So I wasted $30.00 and I am stuck with a case of ""Soy Crisps"" that I will not eat."
4056,4056,4056,4057,5,This has been my favorite soup since childhood.  I was pleased to find it available on Amazon.com at a very reasonable price.  Now I plan to keep a good supply on hand at all times!
4057,4057,4057,4058,5,"Zomg these cookies are sooo good!! I just bought some at the grocery store today after craving raspberry sweets. Wow, was this more than what I was expecting. Between the chocolate, the raspberry and the cookie it's heavenly. They actually put a nice and consistent amount of filling in these unlike most store bought brands. I would definitely recommend them, and I will surely buy them again when I'm having a raspberry and chocolate craving."
4058,4058,4058,4059,5,"I bake, so I'm rarely impressed by store bought cookies. This one, though....divine.  So divine. I don't like heavy chocolate, or dark chocolate, but I like a little chocolate. This cookie is the right amount pastry, raspberry and chocolate, and it's light, like a Madeleine."
4059,4059,4059,4060,5,"My girlfriend and I bought some of this at stater bros for 4 or 5 bucks. Worth every penny. We use this on sandwiches instead of mayo. It is the best stuff. It's not healthy at all, in fact it is really bad for you, so keep that in mind."
4060,4060,4060,4061,5,"I am a mustard lover, I eat mustard on everything.  Without a doubt it is the greatest.  Unfortunately you can only buy in a few stores ""Beaver Honey Mayonnaise Mustard""<br />Maggie"
4061,4061,4061,4062,5,I love this Beaver Brand Honey N Mustard Mayonnaise Sauce.  It is the best combination that I have ever used. Makes a great dipping sause for cheeses
4062,4062,4062,4063,4,"Love this product.  Very flavorable to most anything.  Works great on lunch meat, ham, potato salad, more.  Something similar is sold at Honey Baked Ham locations, but this product is much better."
4063,4063,4063,4064,4,"I bought the Blue Icicle because I had to quickly record some trumpet lines and I didn't have an interface. Well, actually, I did pick up an open box unit that didn't work because they couldn't provide me with the external power supply, so I took it back and got the Icicle as a quick fix that would get me where I needed to go in a timely manner.<br /><br />Hardware: iMac, dual core 2.0 GHz processor and 4 GB or RAM. OS 10.5.8.<br />Software: Garage Band.<br />Mic: Shure SM57.<br /><br />Pros. For recording trumpet with an SM57 it was perfect. Clear sound, low noise, LOTS of signal. With the gain a little over half way on the Icicle and about 58% in Garage Band I got hot horn lines with gain to spare.  Any hotter and they would have started clipping, so it definitely gave enough signal to get the job done.<br /><br />Cons. The gain knob has no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it - it has to be done by feel making it almost impossible to duplicate your settings exactly. This could be improved with a knob with an arrow and a marked dial so you can see where it's set. It also feels a bit cheap - it's lightweight and feels almost fragile. Treated with care it's fine, but I doubt it would take much abuse before it would break and I have been ultra careful with it because it feels so lightweight and cheap.  I also used it as recommended in the accompanying literature and didn't plug it directly into the back of the mic - I used it with a mic cable.<br /><br />For what I needed it was perfect - simple plug and play that got good sound into my computer, and it worked well in a pinch.  I just wish it was a little higher quality in terms of construction.  A bit heavier and a better dial for the analog gain, and I would have rated it a full 5 stars but as it is, I can at best give it 4."
4064,4064,4064,4065,5,"This is all that I needed to make my condensor mic work! I have an MLX 990 and it works great with it! without this I was going to need to buy a preamp, and something that converted XLR to USB and a phantom power generator. This little thing does it all. It does exactly what it says it does, nothing more and nothing less.<br />I am not a professional recorder by any means I just wanted to set up a small studio in my room and be able to have my mic go straight to my laptop without having to buy a small soundboard. This might not work for someone who has a fancier setup than mine, but for my basic stuff it works amazing.<br /><br />The only thing I was surprised about was the size. in the picture it looks like its really small, but its really like 1 1/2"" round and as long as my hand. It in no way effects the performance or anything I just thought it was noteworthy.<br /><br />If this was helpful please take a few seconds to hit the helpful button above. I would really appreciate it :)"
4065,4065,4065,4066,5,"I have several of these converters in my home studio -- the quality is amazing on both dynamics and condenser mics!  I had an Icicle that initially had a low hum, contacted Blue, and they said that the first 500 units produced had a low hum but that has since been fixed.  They sent me a replacement unit and it works perfectly now.  BUY THIS PRODUCT if you have the need."
4066,4066,4066,4067,4,The Icicle is truly a great piece of hardware. It's as simple as plugging your mic cord into the product and plugging that into your USB. The BEST thing about this product is it allows you to take your mic wherever there is a usb equipped computer. It is light weight so I don't know it's durability and don't plan on throwing it to find out. The Icicle comes with a gain knob which is a plus BUT remember with this is a 60 dollar plug n play tool so it doesn't have any other features.<br /><br />*also i didn't have the noise/feedback issue
4067,4067,4067,4068,5,"Though this micpreamp has several weaknesses, I give this 5 stars because it's just perfect for what I do.<br /><br />I've been finding ways to record vocal in convenient way with good quality. Everyone told me I'm suppose to get audio interface for good vocal recording, but audio interfaces always ended up with frustration.<br /><br />After seeing several reviews of Icicle, I was going to return this, but once I used it, I don't think I want to return it anymore.<br /><br />This preamp is way beyond my expectation.<br /><br />However, like I mentioned above, it has weaknesses so this might not be a solution for many people<br /><br />1) it has no headphone jack for direct monitoring<br />2) no asio driver<br />3) only one input<br />4) does not look strong so always be careful<br /><br />If you are a person like me who just to need to record vocal conveniently using easy software like cool edit or audacity, you won't regret."
4068,4068,4068,4069,1,"Just plug and play with your preferred software.  No hassles, worked great for about 3 months then just stopped working.  Didn't drop it (It is made of a flimsy plastic and is light as a feather - feels cheap).  It just stopped working.  When I buy a product I don't just want it to work great for three months.  Totally dissapointed."
4069,4069,4069,4070,5,"I tried this on both Mac OS X and on Vista (not on the same computer), and it worked perfectly with both. Although Vista was a little confusing, nothing more was involved than finding the right audio preferences.  No drivers in either case.  I recorded a short review of the Blue FOR each setup, WITH each setup, which I posted on my devnotes posterous com blog -- you can search that out and listen to both of them if you have any doubts about the sound.  The whole thing lights up blue when it's plugged in, so if you love blue, this mic's for you.  I have a Behringer condenser mic, about the least expensive mic you can find, but it sounded great before and it sounds great through the blue icicle."
4070,4070,4070,4071,4,"I've owned this product for about a year already and it is still working completely fine; although, there was a few technical issues I had to figure out myself. There's no problem with the Blue Icicle itself though. There would be a problem when trying to install this with Windows 7. There was no problem at all using it with Windows XP. It seemed like it would install a different driver instead of it being 'Blue Icicle'. Instead, it would show up as 'USB Multi-Channel Audio Device'. It just didn't sound the same when I was using it with Windows XP. It sounded more louder with some feedback in the background. What I did to fix this problem was to uninstall the 'USB Multi-Channel Audio Device' driver from Device Manager, then unplug the Icicle and plug it back in. When the 'Installing device driver software' notification pops up, click it and click 'Skip obtaining driver software from Windows Update'. It will now be installed as 'Blue Icicle' and work like how it should be! Make sure you raise the levels up in Sound in Control Panel if the mic sounds too low for you, even with the Gain Control Volume up; it shouldn't be up that high anyways as it would have some feedback in the background. I'm not sure if I'm the only one with this problem, but I hope this helps whoever does!<br /><br />When I first got the Icicle, it sounded amazing and I had a lot of fun with it! I still do, too! I use this with my Audio-Technica AT2020. I use it almost everyday, whether if it's for music producing or online gaming with friends. And yes, this does work for the PS3 -- not sure about the Xbox 360 though. I recommend this product for anyone who doesn't have a mixer for their microphone 'cause mixers are kind of expensive! Haha."
4071,4071,4071,4072,1,"Owned two of these and when they work they are fine.  The power knob has no indicator on it though.  My biggest problem, and the reason I will NEVER purchase another, is this: both gave out with in a year.  One now sounds like I am recording from behind a wall and one developed a hum that will not go away.  Do yourself a favor and find a more reliable option."
4072,4072,4072,4073,1,"Great audio, until a few months in it just decides to stop working. Common problem: google it and you'll see. Cheapest construction of any product every designed in the entire world. Feels like a fast food toy.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product. Piece o' garbage."
4073,4073,4073,4074,2,"I will admit, the Icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an XLR jack to your computer using a USB jack. It does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software.<br /><br />Beyond that, the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level.<br /><br />I tried this with an AKG 200, BLUE enCORE 200 and an AKG 4500. All deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain. I could barely get an audible record level yelling into the enCORE 200, my staple for location voice recording. Normally, I plug the enCORE directly into a digital audio recorder with an XLR cable. No mic preamp, no phantom power, no EQ, and I get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level.<br /><br />This is one very disappointing product. If you route your mic through a preamp, then put the Icicle between the preamp and the USB input of your computer, you can get a decent record level, but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid. Personally, I think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip* or mic preamp and an XLR to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the Icicle altogether.<br /><br />BLUE makes some great products, but this is not one of their better ones.<br /><br />*For those that don't know, Channel Strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box: typically a mic preamp and a compressor. Higher end units add some EQ capability as well or have other options."
4074,4074,4074,4075,5,Great USB audio interface! I also own the Shure X2U and they perform just about the same...I wish I would have known that before I spent way more on the X2U.
4075,4075,4075,4076,1,"This product was awesome the first couple months, I was convinced I was over any potential ""defective period..."" Well, after caring for it well and giving it no reason not to work, it of course stopped working for me. I now can't use it for anything serious. Anything I record that is profound or important runs the risk of cutting out half way without giving any warning leaving me with half a recording of audio and half with crickets. There must be some crappy design inside the tube that prevents establishing a solid connection, I'm just happy it's not my $100 blue microphone! Don't waste your money on the icicle, it's productive ability has an expiration."
4076,4076,4076,4077,1,"Cheap: A plastic tube with some presumably lightweight circuit inside.  Never worked right; no user interface, no known way to engage or defeat the phantom power."
4077,4077,4077,4078,5,"Put simply this is a brilliant piece of kit... does exactly what it says on the tin... converts any XLR mic to USB  - including phantom power supply.<br /><br />We have an Neuman professional condenser mic here at Blockhouse tv and I kid you not  - it sounds amazing with this piece of kit.  Have plugged into our mac and thrown the signal into Audacity and/or Final Cut pro and it sounds the business - no hum, noise, clicks or pop. We use it to voice the children's animation DVD series; Jack and Holly.  Both the actors and the tech staff find it a really easy and portable set-up to use. OK - looks aren't great - and it's plastic - but I don't really give a monkey's about that - all I care about is the signal to noise ratio, the sound quality and can it power our very expensive mics?  The answer is - yes it can.  We say buy!<br /><br /> <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AM5PZ4"">Jack and Holly's Christmas Countdown (US Format)</a> <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00439GWTM"">Jack and Holly's Christmas Countdown (European format)DVD </a>"
4078,4078,4078,4079,4,"I already have the Bluebird from Blue and was using it to record a friend's live performance. With only a laptop computer at my disposal, I was able to connect my XLR to USB directly into Garageband. The Icicle is small, portable, and so easy to use-- plus, I didn't have to carry a huge A to D converter!"
4079,4079,4079,4080,1,"I was told by the salesman at Guitar Center that the Icicle was easy and very high quality. . .  It is perfectly easy but I have had nothing but problems from mine. There is a constant popping in anything I record.  I am using an AKG C3000B microphone I have had for a long time and it is in perfect condition so the problem is not with my mic.  Anyone else having this problem? Haven't been in touch with tech support yet, but I will say I am not happy with the Icicle. . ."
4080,4080,4080,4081,3,"Icicle is a pretty good preamp for the price.<br /><br />Very easy setup and a cool design, but definitely was not very rigid. It's very light and made of plastic.<br />But the one things that I didn't like was the noise. It had a fair amount of buzz along with it.<br /><br />A cheap preamp for the price, but you get what you pay for."
4081,4081,4081,4082,2,"I find that even with the gain on maximum, the volume is not very loud.  I use it with a Shure SM57 mic and my Macbook (using Audacity).  One must be very close to the mike and speak somewhat loudly.  When I use the Shure mics with a mixer (the ""analog"" way), there are no volume problems.<br /><br />It is simple to set up, being almost ""plug and play"".  You have to choose the input source."
4082,4082,4082,4083,5,"Read a few reviews, some good and some bad, and i finally decided to take the risk since the icicle was on sale.<br /><br />Works great and is perfect for a home/room studio.<br /><br /> I love everything Blue: Though the icicle is a little light and delicate, i treat it as careful as i do my microphone.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product."
4083,4083,4083,4084,4,"Have only had the need to use this a few times, but it has always performed well and consistently. Nice that it has a little preamp so you can control levels - doesn't seem to color the tone in any negative way."
4084,4084,4084,4085,2,"the product was simply not recognized by my windows 7 home premium computer. very disappointed, considering on the Blue website it says that it is. I gave this the extra star because im sure its a great product, but the lack of communication of the compatibly was very disappointing. Most likely wont be buying anything else from Blue"
4085,4085,4085,4086,4,"I have little doubt that the Blue Icicle will get the job done with a Shure SM-58, or similar ""dynamic"" microphone.  But its claim that it will convert any ""condenser"" mic, even one that normally requires XLR connection and phantom power, into a ""plug 'n play"" USB mic should not be taken at face value.  I say this because I have an acquaintance with the original Audio Technica AT2020 Condenser mic who had intermittent and marginal success when he tried such a conversion.  In the long run, he would have been ahead (in terms of both the conversion and saving a few bucks) by purchasing the AT2020 USB mic.  As it is, the Blue Icicle is probably the best such converter on the market (the comparably priced LightSnake cable will not convert condenser mics, despite what you may have read).  So, if necessary, give it a try--and more than one.  But make sure there are return privileges."
4086,4086,4086,4087,4,Works fine for my Podcasting needs. I use it with a sure SM58 microphone. It is made of plastic and does feel cheap but I have had it for a few months and had zero problems with it. For desktop use it should be fine. Works great for my needs. Wouldn't recommend for heavy use on a stage or being tossed around.
4087,4087,4087,4088,5,"It does what it says. I was only worried that either it wouldn't be compatible with my mic, or that my computer wouldn't recognize it, but everything turned out great. It's plug and play, my computer (running Windows 7) instantly recognized it and I was able to use this right away (in less than 5 minutes from unboxing it).<br /><br />It seemed like a joke to me at first, because it is so small and lightweight, so I thought it wouldn't actually supply Phantom Power or something like that, but it actually does, so this is pretty great. What I love most about this is that it is extremely portable and easy to set up, I DEFINITELY recommend this."
4088,4088,4088,4089,4,"This device does one thing and it does it well. I use it to record demos and it provides a crisp, clean sound with zero noise! I have read some reviews where people complain about the durability of the icicle. While it feels a little chinsy, I hardly think it will snap in half. The price is right and the sound is great.<br /><br />For the most part, setting the icicle up is incredibly easy. I had a few instances where I had to reboot for Windows to recognize it again and such, but no serious headaches.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great device to have on hand of for the traveling musician who wants to quickly lay down ideas on the road."
4089,4089,4089,4090,5,"This thing is great. I am running a BlueBird into the Icicle into Logic 9 and the sound I am getting is tremendous. There's little to no noise, but it boosts the signal plenty. I've had no trouble with not having enough gain, I have plenty of sound. Another thing is that I don't think it feels as light and toy-like as a lot of people here have stated. Just treat it with care, and don't drop it like any piece of musical equipment. Fantastic buy for the money, recommended."
4090,4090,4090,4091,4,"i have used the icicle a few times, and it sounds great! everything works how it's supposed to, and it is a very simple but efficient interface. the ONLY thing that i can see that's wrong with it, is it just feels light and cheap. granted its only around $40 so you can't expect too much from it. the plastic just feels rather cheap. but i plan on treating it very nicely and gently anyways so all in all i don't foresee a major problem on that front."
4091,4091,4091,4092,5,"I was somewhat skeptical about purchasing any XLR to USB adaptor, but I have to say...this thing works great! The recordings are crisp and clear, just as good as recording on my camcorder in PCM! Now, I can record directly to my PC without the need of Mini DV tapes and capturing the audio to the computer! The unit is a bit cheap feeling (weight-wise) but don't let that fool you one bit!<br /><br />It's true plug and play too! No need for any additional drivers/software...simply plug everything together and you're off and running! Overall, it's a great product! I highly recommend this for anyone who does any amount of voice recording!"
4092,4092,4092,4093,4,"3 years ago I bought a Digidesign 002 protools rack and a lot of other equipment to start recording - but I could never get it to work with my OS on either computer.  I was at an impasse for a long time until I saw this product on Blue's website.  I already had a $400 condenser mic in the closet I had never gotten to use and didn't want to spend more money on a quality USB mic.  I couldn't be happy that this product exists - in it's quality or price!  I noticed no noise or coloration of the signal and it worked without a problem.  It does exactly what it's suppose to do -- act like it doesn't exist.  It just serves it purpose to convert the signal well, and stays out of the way on everything else.  It does feel light weight and the signal was a little lower than i thought (as many reviews said) and that is the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars.  But I don't think that should keep anyone from getting this product."
4093,4093,4093,4094,4,"I've had this product for 6 or 7 months at this point and I use it for podcasting. I've used 3 different mics one was dynamic and the other two condenser. All three have worked just fine as if I had plugged them into a mixer or a PA system, no problems. I have also beaten the crap out of this thing, knocked it around way too much and left it on the floor at my desk where I record, no problems still runs fine and it's not showing any signs of stopping. This thing is also super easy, plug and record on any software including the free Audacity software, Garage Band, and Sony Acid (the three I've tested)<br />One problem, that gain knob, while very useful, is super super touchy. I found a volume I liked and then taped it down, otherwise it'll jack up or down the gain with the slightest jostling. Doesn't make this a bad product, it just means have some tape handy and this is a quick and easy solution especially for podcasters who don't want to be limited to the USB microphones and don't want to shell out big money for a USB compatible mixer."
4094,4094,4094,4095,4,using it for recording vocals on home PC using Shure C606 mic. It is a big improvement over the mic to stereo in for sure.. There is no background noise which was very prevailant in the mic in method. The 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the gain. Even with the gain knob turned all the way up i still had to add gain from my software for the sound to be loud enough. But overall a great product.. do not regret buying it and would recommend it as well.
4095,4095,4095,4096,5,"ive heard mixed reviews of this.. yeah it feels cheap... but so what?! just take care of it like you would anything like that! and it sounds perfect! i use it to record vocals on logic studio (i get others to sing, i cannot; but they sound amazing) ive had no problems with it and im super happy with the purchase. well worth the money!"
4096,4096,4096,4097,4,"Pros: Easy to use. Plug it in, set your levels and go! Works well with Condenser Mics. Has 48v Phantom Power. Runs solely off USB (No need for a wall wart).<br /><br />Cons: Very plastic. Feels like it could snap with the slightest bit of rough handling! I wouldn't try to plug it directly into a mic. Use an XLR cable. No headphone monitoring jack and quite a bit of latency when monitoring with a separate interface. I would not recommend it for Dynamic mics. I tried it with my Rode Procaster Dynamic Mic and could not get high enough levels without practically yelling into the mic. I also tried it with an old V-Tech handheld stage mic and levels were a little better, so dynamics with a higher line output might work better with it.<br /><br />Overall, it does what it's supposed to, but it could be a lot better. For about $30-40 more, you can get better interfaces with 2 mic inputs, but this one is nice for situations where running off of USB power is a must."
4097,4097,4097,4098,4,"Simple, plug-in setup. Garageband recognizes it right away, as long as it's opened as first step, before plugging in Icicle. Nice, clean, ""transparent"" sound without much coloring with my Electrovoice stage mic. Depending upon your setup, you may have to crank up your inputs and headphone volumes to get comfortable levels.  Blue recommends plugging directly into computer. A great little device for the price!"
4098,4098,4098,4099,5,"Brought this product for recording a radio program from home. Along with the Behringer<br />C-1 microphone, provides a cost effective solution."
4099,4099,4099,4100,3,"The level from this unit was hard to adjust, and when all was said and done, it was very low."
4100,4100,4100,4101,4,"I have some nice mics round my place for video and thought I could use them to help my skype chats, and for the money it is amazing little USB device."
4101,4101,4101,4102,4,"I was a little concerned after reader some of the reviews here, but the warranty, Blue's reputation, and Amazon customer service convinced me to give it a try. And in general, I'm pretty satisfied with it. Using it with one of my Oktava MK-301 microphones I get excellent sound, no hum, and so far, excellent reliability. I'm using it with Audacity and a few other programs, none of which have any difficulty recognizing it. There were some issues setting it up initially, and I'm a bit leery about the plastic construction, but for what I paid I think it's a good value. For those thinking of using it in field recording- stick it inside a carrying bag, and tape the cable to it to prevent stressing the USB connector. You shouldn't have any problems."
4102,4102,4102,4103,1,"I have several different ways of connecting XLR microphones to my computers for use in webinars, and I thought this design would be simpler to transport and connect, but when I tried to use it with a Shure SM58 mic the volume it produced was about 25% of what I am used to, and was not adequate for my purpose."
4103,4103,4103,4104,1,"I had this product for literally only a week, and had only used it one time. When trying to use it again I found that it wasn't sending the sound through. When I plug it into my PC, it recognizes it and the icicle lights up, and i select it as my recording device, but then when i actually try to record, it makes no sound at all (and i have tried moving the gain knob around so it's not that) This was a complete waste of money, unless there's an easy fix that i'm missing..."
4104,4104,4104,4105,5,"We've only had the Blue Icicle 1 week, but my daughter loves it, and is working with it every day.<br /><br />How good is it ?  My daughter is 18, and turned down $25,000 a year in scholarship money to Pepperdine's Music program as a coluratura soprano.  Her voice is so perfectly re-produced using a Shure 57 and the Icicle, that I can not tell when she sings and when she plays it back through the computer, an off-the-shelf Dell, using a pair of $30 JBL computer speakers for sound.<br /><br />The icicle is really good.<br /><br />Now they can replace the old TV commercial, from ""Is it live, or is it Memorex ?""<br />to  ""Is it live, or is it Blue ?"""
4105,4105,4105,4106,3,It does record with ease and decent quality for the price. The only problem is it acts as a sound card and you can't record and listen to yourself at the same time without latency. This is a deal breaker for me. Blue microphones should add a headphone jack onto the interface so you don't have to listen to recordings through your computer and you can hear your recordings in real time.
4106,4106,4106,4107,5,"Let's get this out of the way, first: Yes the case is made of thin flimsy plastic, and it doesn't look like it can handle drops to the floor.<br /><br />I'm using it with a Behringer ecm8000 mic and Real Time Analyzer (RTA) software (on my laptop running WindowsXP PRO SP3) to precisely tune notch filters and speaker crossover networks and it works perfectly.  Audio output sinewaves show up very clean and accurate under an oscilloscope, with peaks at 90 degrees (which is a good sign).  No hissing sounds at all, it's very quiet with a mic connected, high frequency-spectrum wise.  For the record, I bought a usb to Toslink output adapter to connect to the amplifier because integrated laptop/PC sound cards are usually noisy as hell.<br /><br />I think some people are using mics with very low sensitivity or crappy output sources (e.g. cheesy soundcards, amps, receivers or multimedia speakers), or even lousy, improperly shielded mic cables and blaming the unit, but who knows.  What I can safely say is, for the cheap price, the unit manages to produce an output that has a very high gain and runs virtually flat while covering the entire audio spectrum.<br /><br />WINDOW7 FUNCTIONALITY(updated):<br />At first, it didn't work with WINDOWS7 x64 Ultimate.  I kept getting a message about not being able to find a driver.  And at the time the Icicle website made no mention of Windows 7 compatibility (2 months later, they are saying it's compatible with XP, VISTA and Windows 7).  After nearly giving up, I found my old USB motorola cell phone charger cable lying around and noticed it had a similar mini-usb header to the that of the Icicle's.  I connected the Icicle using the motorola cable into my Windows 7 PC, and to my surprise it was recognized.  I actually got the idea when the Icicle began losing its USB connection (with the original cable) whenever I moved it around a lot.  Could it be the dinky looking USB cable included with the Icile causing intermittent disconnects or driver problems with Windows 7?  I'm really not sure at this point.  What I can say is that the Blue Icicle seems 100% reliable when used with the old Motorola USB cable.  Perhaps the Motorola cable makes better contact or has better shielding--who knows.  (I'm inclined to cut away the white insulation of the original Icicle cable just see if it's shielded to the USB's electrical ground source.  It wouldn't be the first time I find an unshielded USB cable.  Then again, it might be the mini-USB header causing the problem.)"
4107,4107,4107,4108,1,"this does not work on windows 7, tried reinstating software and to no surprise it din't work. This was a waste of time and money. Be aware of this issue."
4108,4108,4108,4109,5,"This Icicle performs flawlessly with very good audio quality for my audio-technica cardiod condensor mic.  Took me a short while to figure out the little silver button on the side wasn't a button, but instead a rotational knob for setting the gain.  This device literally plugs into your USB port on a Mac, you adjust that knob, and your done.  You then can forget about the device and enjoy flawless audio performance out of your mic.  This beats the hell out of the more expensive FireWire solutions I had used before."
4109,4109,4109,4110,1,"I have been using a standard XLR to USB cable with my Shure 58 dynamic mic, which works okay, except for an annoying hissing noise that accompanies the majority of my vocal recordings.  I bought the Icicle in hopes of eliminating those noise issues.<br /><br />When I received the Icicle, I couldn't wait to plug it in and take it for a ""test"" drive. Unfortunately, right off, I got an error - unable to load drivers.  This is a plug and play device, so there are no drivers to download, and I knew something wasn't right. After 3 restarts and uninstalling the USB Hubs and ports numerous times, as suggested by Icicle's troubleshooting website, it was still a no go.  I went to Icicle's website and logged a ticket, explaining the issues in detail and that I was running Windows 7.  The next day, I received an email instructing me to send the Icicle back, as it has a defective driver.  Amazon was GREAT about sending a replacement while the return was on its way.<br /><br />So, I received the replacement Icicle today, pulled it out of its packaging and with bated breath, plugged it in, hoping for success. No such luck - the same error message came up about the drivers. I decided to Google my issue:  ""Icicle compatibility with Windows 7"", and Bam!, it took me to a Guitar Center review of the Icicle that CLEARLY shows in the product specifications that it is NOT compatible with Windows 7.<br /><br />Amazon needs to get on the ball and add this to their information.  It is nowhere in Amazon's description and the Icicle ""techs"" themselves didn't have a clue about it either. I found this inadequacy with the blue mic technical team to be unacceptable.  They probably have non-technical CSRs pretending to be techs for all their troubleshooting. That's one way to save a dime, but please people - if you're going to give us ""technical support"", then say so.  If it isn't really technical support, then say it is Customer Service.<br /><br />I am terribly disappointed that this device has not been upgraded to accommodate the newer technologies.  Windows 7 has been out for some time now.  There is no indication in the little mini booklet that comes in the Icicle package that says Windows 7 is incompatible -it only gives set-up info for Mac and Windows (does not show which OS).  I am sending my Icicle back to Amazon for a refund and will need to look for something that WILL work with Windows 7.<br /><br />If you have a PC that was purchased in 2011 or later, save yourself the hassle and don't bother with this product, as your OS will more than likely be Windows 7."
4110,4110,4110,4111,2,"Picked one up to use with a laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium.  The computer saw the item, but said it needed troubleshooting.  Nothing worked.  After researching online, I found that many people had run into this problem.  Apparently, the firmware is not compatible with Windows 7; it's supposedly been corrected in newer runs, but there's no way to tell if the one you're purchasing is newer or not.  I tried contacting Blue, twice, hoping to get a firmware update, or check into exchanging it, but never got a response from both attempts, so I finally just had to return it."
4111,4111,4111,4112,5,"I have now owned this product for over a year and it is still going strong. I mainly use it for voice overs for YouTube videos, Skype calls, and recording music. It all works great.<br /><br />When I first received it in the mail, I simply opened it, plugged it in, and it worked. As simple as that. There were no drivers, no installation, and no updates. I just plugged my XLR condenser microphone into the Icicle and the Icicle to the USB on my computer and it was immediately recognized as a USB mic.<br /><br />This product was WAY lighter than I expected and feels rather cheap. However, that is not really an issue because the product works great. And the blue glow that lights up when you plug it in adds some nice visual appeal.<br /><br />The knob is also useful, as it allows you to control the sensitivity of the mic.<br /><br />Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product, as it is plug and play. Very simple, and it just works."
4112,4112,4112,4113,1,"I'll add to the growing list of reviews here regarding the Windows 7 ""USB Audio Device"" error.  I figured I had a 50% chance of it working.  It didn't.  Windows 7 insists on loading a USB driver that doesn't work.  There is a review here giving details on how to possibly circumvent this loading process, however, that did not work for me.  Its easier to return this thing, than spend my whole weekend jerking around in Windows 7 hardware manager.<br /><br />Blue probably has a good product here, and probably blames Windows for this issue.  However, BLUE should provide a driver that works.  Don't rely on Windows to do this.  That is corporate laziness.  Spend some resources on programming something that works for Windows 7... make it available on your support website, and make it true plug and play.  Not plug and cross-fingers, then spend hours messing around in the weeds of Windows settings.<br /><br />Also agree with other reviews here... in the 2 days I spent with this product... it's all plastic parts, feels cheap and fragile, and the gain button is poorly thought out.<br /><br />Hey Blue... you had my business... then you lost me.  I'm moving on to something else."
4113,4113,4113,4114,5,I use this with my Audio Technica condensor. Works great for home recordings hooked up to garageband on macbook pro for rough recordings. Its super simple to use and has a dial for the gain. It's not bulky which is a nice.
4114,4114,4114,4115,5,This people is a must have especially to take xlr over to usb it provides un  interrupted audio flow during recording and provides phantom power. Great invention !
4115,4115,4115,4116,5,"This thing works instantly. You plug in your mic and plug the usb into your computer. It will light up, then you adjust the sound to what is audible. It can get pretty loud. I was intimidated at first when contemplating the purchase because of the low price; but it has done everything I needed it for. The other preamp models I was looking at were near $200.<br /><br />The only ""downside"" to this is that it looks plastic. I don't consider it a con because the look doesnt really matter."
4116,4116,4116,4117,1,"purchased and it came looking new, as i had bought it NEW, but it was actually damaged.<br />customer service with the actual company is awful--as i needed to contact the company itself to return it."
4117,4117,4117,4118,5,"The Icicle is an excellent product, works as advertised. I think it's the easiest way to attach a quality mic directly to your computer.<br />the icicle is a fine ""Plug & Play"" mic interface."
4118,4118,4118,4119,4,"Going from the $600 Digidesign Mbox to this $15 tube made me feel like I got back at Digidesign for screwing all of us who had XP computers that they refused to support after we bought their over-priced gear for recording voice overs.<br />I could wish that the Blue Ice converter was made of heavier materials and came with a CS department that one could reach. But, for $15... well, 'nough said."
4119,4119,4119,4120,1,"Used it a couple of times over the course of a month, and it worked great! Third time, high pitched noise, and no mic signal coming through. Not too surprising, given how flimsy this thing feels. This is apparently a known issue, just look at other 1-star reviews of this product. 'Nuff said!"
4120,4120,4120,4121,4,This product has worked since the first day I have had it. Tremendous buy for me. I needed my mic to go directly into the computer. Thanks.
4121,4121,4121,4122,5,"Bought this because i didnt want to pay 100 plus for the alternative. Found it to be extremely reliable. Very crisp sound with little to no background noise. Before i bought it other reviews stated it seemed a bit cheap. I disagree, though i do find it to be a bit bulky for it's function. I did drop and break it once, but it  was completely my fault. After breaking it, i contacted customer service, and it was replaced very rapidly. The company's website was easy to navigate, and rather amusing."
4122,4122,4122,4123,2,"I wanted to like this product, as it would have been a fast and easy solution for many of my needs, but it didn't work well at all.  Very noisy.  Lots of hissing and pops that are completely absent when using the same mics and computers with other adapter devices.  Considering the decent reviews by others, I may just have a defective unit.  Either way... it's going back in the mail today."
4123,4123,4123,4124,1,"I bought this before I purchased the MXL Micmate. It is plastic, and very cheaply made. I felt like it would break very easily, and would not be something that would last me a while. So then I bought the Micmate. It is solid metal, and is way better sound quality than this. I beg you to buy that over the Icicle. Buy the MXL used (Like New) from ""TheMintMovieMan"", a great seller and it is a great product. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VZ8WC2"">MXL MICMATEC XLR To USB Preamp for Condenser Microphones</a>"
4124,4124,4124,4125,5,"I don't write reviews at all but I'm just going to say that this is a very decent product to buy if you're not looking to spend hundreds of dollars on a mixer, phantom power supply, and pre-amp for XLR mic recording. Because guess what this little thing has it all in one all for a low price! Cop you one!"
4125,4125,4125,4126,4,"""Patrick"" gave a spot on explanation of everything, just in different uses. Personally, I use it vocally, and acoustically and it has worked perfectly in every way, however, either something is lacking in craftsmanship or  i find my ability to adjust by feel is a little more connected to using numbers instead of blanks. I found the quality just like Patrick said. I too think it ""feels almost fragile;"" And, ""I also used...a mic cable"" because for me, that seemed the most sensible solution because I didn't really need it to move it. So, I mounted the connection to my desk; And now I move it very little. Aside from the ""no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it,"" on the gain knob, i think it would be awesome if they just threw in some molded heavy something to give it some weight for setting on your desk. That would make it secure and you would feel like it had a little better quality in craftsmanship. Hey maybe even give the connector itself a littl weight to stay put. Anyways, great product but I guess, ""Thats what... he said?..."" Regardless,<br /><br />Pros: Does what it says. Get it if you need it. Its at an amazing price compared to the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PPXFAG"">Shure X2U XLR-to-USB Signal Adapter</a> version. This, however, is fantastic for people saving for a new Presonus interface like me.<br /><br />Cons: Craftsmanship appears lacking."
4126,4126,4126,4127,4,"Plugged direct into windows and controlled via ustream.tv software interface - this worked well, (although we needed a little more gain - obtainable by using better software - cubase, garage band etc), as an interim setup before we could get a more pro level interface for more than one mic etc.  Nice!<br />It feels a bit flimsy construction wise - but we were not going to take it on the road!"
4127,4127,4127,4128,5,"I use this to record in GarageBand on my MacBook. It works unfailingly and sounds as good as it should considering my primitive setup. I love the level knob and the quality construction. If you read the instructions and use it correctly, this tool is invaluable."
4128,4128,4128,4129,4,This product works. If you are only looking to do vocals this is a good product. So far I've had it a few months with no experience of sound distortion or loss of power. Its great if you don't want to go to the trouble of figuring out how to use a mixer. I've been told a pre-amp is better but it seems to work alright for me and my MXL 67G.
4129,4129,4129,4130,5,"I've purchased a few of these, and they are very reliable. I've used them with Win7 and OS X. The A/D quality is acceptable for most needs. The limited bit depth and sample rate are probably the only drawbacks."
4130,4130,4130,4131,4,"I was really worried when I ordered this that the phantom power would make it overheat, apparently I was worried for nothing! I use this paired with a Blue Yeti Pro, a seriously beefy microphone, running over shielded cable that is about eighty feet away, It's absolutely great!<br /><br />The one downside that I have seen from this piece of kit: It will occasionally not register as a USB device, Granted I only have seen it happen once, but you will always want to double check your connections!"
4131,4131,4131,4132,4,Cheap and works well the only thing is the gain on it is a little low even at highest setting. Other than that ir records well and does what it needs to.
4132,4132,4132,4133,3,"Never really intended to use this in a professional setting so the noise issue is not that big of a deal. Just wanted a simple device that could fit in my backpack to interface with my laptop for impromptu interviews and music recordings. For the price paid, it's very cheap and lightweight plastic construction leaves much to be desired. Overall, I can not recommend this product at the current price it's sold at. 15 to 20 dollars, then sure. Still, it's an OK product."
4133,4133,4133,4134,3,it is what is is... and it did the job that it was made for. lasts long if u take care of it but is easily out grown when just starting ur own studion
4134,4134,4134,4135,5,"I create language teaching materials for a living on both PCs and Macs. Not only do I care about the sound quality of audio recordings for voice, but I record a lot of music as well. For work I that I do at home, I bought the Blue Microphones Icicle to use with high quality condenser mics. Before buying I read lots of reviews here and some others online.<br /><br />When the Icicle arrived, it worked fine right of the bat. Since then I have recorded hours and hours of audio on it, using both PCs and Macs. Not once have I had any problems with the product."
4135,4135,4135,4136,5,"Perfect tool for any musicians trying to make recording much easier at an affordable price.<br />Easy to open plastic case, medium sized, durable (People have said that the plastic body feels cheap<br />and feels easy to break but it's not true. The Icicle's plastic body feels durable and won't break if<br />you're not clumsy with it or break it on purpose). I only wished that the ""Gain Control"" had numbers or indications<br />of levels so I can turn the knob to the correct position for recording and remember it instead of guessing all the time. Sound quality is FLAWLESS! No buzzing noises or anything picked up really...just nice crispy sound recorded through a good quality microphone is all I hear. I hear no difference in it with an Icicle or a Mixer"
4136,4136,4136,4137,5,This product works just as advertised!! Guitar center told me the only way to connect my mic to my computer was either an expensive converter box or a usb mic. A-HOLES haha. I love this little gizmo and would definitely recommend it to a friend!!
4137,4137,4137,4138,5,"I bought the ICICLE because I have been doing a lot of hip-hop vocals and I was using a Samson C01U and the thing with that Mic you can get close to studio but with so much work and you can always tell that you messed with it alot.<br /><br />Well I always wanted to buy a expensive Mic but didnt want to spend $200 more on a USB Pre-Amp so I see this on here the other day and went to Guitar Center and after deciding for a while I went with it. I also already had a MXL V-88 which is a pretty high end condenser mic, although now you can find it for cheap but original RSPV=$700 and average selling price after it being out was $349-400. But I am very happy.<br /><br />I use Reaper to record vocals with a ASIO driver (AND IT DOES WORK WITH MY ASIO DRIVER) someone put in their comment that it doesnt. For those of you that arnt familure with ASIO it is a driver/program that runs and samples your audio going in, you basically use it with anything that is MIDI or MIDI/MIC to USB. It makes your audio not lag and sound more professional. Also for the people that said the volume was too low, go into Sound in windows and turn the mic up a little, I keep mine on 5%. Also your recording program will let you turn up while your monitoring the record or after.<br /><br />GO AHEAD AND BUY ONE!"
4138,4138,4138,4139,4,"I'm glad i came across the blue icicle (on amazon othere prices where 60 or more) before i went on to buy a mic, preamp and source for phantom power. I literally got i all in one at a verrryyy low price. Good bargain. i recomend it for anyone with a home studio and deff go buy a xlr cable. plugging a mic deirectly into it wont work so well."
4139,4139,4139,4140,4,"A great tool for low budget home recording. I mic every track to Audacity. I use a low budget dynamic mic and the Icicle gives the right boost for PC recording. I keep the gain at 90 to 100 percent and do volume control on the PC.<br />I see some complaints out there about durability. Keep in mind it is a piece of computer hardware like a modem or an external hard drive, NOT something that you would use onstage or throw into a gig bag. Another plus is no drivers or setup. That's important to me when I get home from work and want to record a tune. Just plug it in and go!"
4140,4140,4140,4141,5,I needed the Icicle to provide better audio quality for recordings I was doing on my PC. I wanted to use my high quality XLR mic for this purpose and found that the Icicle provided far better performance than any other USB mic that I currently owned. I didn't have any problem with the trim pod on the Icicle as reported by a previous review so maybe Blue Mic has corrected that issue.<br /><br />I have and do recommend this to anyone that wants to use their current XLR mic on their PC. The product is great and the price is right.
4141,4141,4141,4142,4,"Great price for what you are getting.  Recording via a USB port ROCKS!!!! The only thing that could maybe be improved is the durability.  It feels like a toothpick in your hand.  It may be more durable than it feels, but I'm still going to be very careful with it.  But, for the price this is only a minor gripe.  Great product, I would recommend it to anyone."
4142,4142,4142,4143,5,"Works well.  It is slightly lighter than expected, but the quality of the sound is excellent."
4143,4143,4143,4144,1,"I used the icicle for about two hours. After taking a break, I plug it in and my laptop wont recognize it. I did everything I could think of to fix this, even hours of searching google. Nothing. In the process of a return. =/ It would've been perfect if it just worked."
4144,4144,4144,4145,1,"It works reasonably well with condenser microphones.  With dynamics the hum exceeds the signal.  Works with Windows, not with Linux.  The build is very cheap.  Anything more than $5 for this is too much."
4145,4145,4145,4146,5,"Muy buen producto. por su tama&ntilde;o, uno lo puede llevar a culquier lado junto con su laptop y hacer culquier grabaci&oacute;n, en cualquier momento. Antes de tener este producto, tuve muchos problemas con la entrada de audio en mi mac, pero con el icicle por fin pude tener una entrada decente para cualquier micr&oacute;fono. Hasta el momento no genera ruidos de ning&uacute;n tipo y la calidad es impresionante para algo tan simple."
4146,4146,4146,4147,3,"I bought this device and use a brand new sure 52 with it.<br /><br />The noise and feedback I received with this device was horrible - I might have a bad unit.<br /><br />When I called customer service, a real person answered right away and offered to expedite getting me a new unit. (Very cool and is why I gave them 3 stars for now)<br /><br />I'll see how that process goes and update my review."
4147,4147,4147,4148,4,"Bought it thinking this would plug into the Wii and I would be able to use my condenser microphone with it. Well, long story short, doesnt work. But it is still usable with a PC/laptop to record audio. But we can do that with a builtin mic also. Would u like to pay 1$ towards the presidential election?"
4148,4148,4148,4149,3,"Shipping: Ordered on a Sunday of Week 1.  Placed in box on a Friday of Week 2. Received it Wednesday of Week 3. Whoever's responsible for shipping (Amazon or Blue) took their sweet time to drop it in this 8""x5"" box.<br /><br />Product: Currently testing the converter with a Shure PG58. Gain is incredibly low and a annoying tone when recording. I do believe the product is in working condition; too bad I have to figure out how to edit the hardware properly."
4149,4149,4149,4150,1,"I ordered this item on March 22nd.  I expect to get its replacement from the people at Blue sometime today.  So, what's a month, anyway?  The first one that came from Amazon had a constant, high-pitched tone.  I emailed, then called Blue, and eventually spoke to a pleasant tech support guy who was aware of the problem. He allowed that the company had shipped out a number of units with this defect.  That's always good to hear.  So, several emails later, I received a Return Merchandise Authorization, and shipped it right back to them.  Who knows, if this one works, maybe I'll like it.  Blue's products look good, but they make a strong case for buying locally."
4150,4150,4150,4151,5,"This product is excellent for the group of people who have Celiac disease.  A tasty treat for Sunday brunch. The only problem I have, is the cost, but<br />as we all know, being saddled with Celiac disease is not cheap."
4151,4151,4151,4152,5,"So life with a gluten allergy can sometimes seem unfair; however, once bisquick started making this product, things got a lot more equal. It tastes like Bisquick. It works like Bisquick. Hey, it is Bisquick. It just happens to be gluten-free. Perfect pancakes! Enough said."
4152,4152,4152,4153,5,"Finally a gluten free mix that tastes great! I have used this mix over and over and I have never been disappointed. It works just the way the regular mix works and it has opened up a whole new world for me. I thought I would never be able to find a mix that I like, but this one I love. I am excited about trying all the fun things I can do with it. Even cookies!"
4153,4153,4153,4154,5,"The first time we cracked open a box of Bisquick Gluten Free and made a batch of pancakes, I was surprised. They were DELICIOUS! Perhaps the best pancakes I've ever had. We did make a couple modifications from the box recipe. Instead of using oil, we use the same amount of melted butter. And we add fresh blueberries to each pancake as it's cooking. Then, serve with whipped cream. So great! I'm looking forward to trying some of the other recipes with this, including pizza crust."
4154,4154,4154,4155,5,"I really like it when my wife makes anything from her Betty Crocker cookbook, so I know when we got the gluten free pancakes that they would be good.  They are not overly dry like some of the other brands of gluten free pancakes.<br /><br />We usually have them with earth balance butter spread, and sliced bananas or sliced strawberries, chopped pecans or walnuts and maple syrup.  They are great."
4155,4155,4155,4156,5,"A few years ago, going Gluten Free was really difficult. I missed the basic things I loved to eat and pancakes were certainly one of them. I tried other mixes but the batters were very dry and required items to moisten them such as fruit, etc. But Bisquick's GF pancake mix was surprisingly good! It is a great alternative to the real thing. Certainly all of us Gluten Sensitives out there know it will never be that delicious stack of buttermilk pancakes like we once knew, but I'm happy to know there's a great alternative. :)"
4156,4156,4156,4157,4,"This replaces many of other brands of Pizza crust mix, cake mix, foccaccia and more.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it is slightly pricey, but that is an issue of living gluten free.  Enjoy and be creative with it."
4157,4157,4157,4158,5,As far as gluten free products this is awesome.  I use it as a substitute for any recipe that asks for flour.  It makes great pumpkin waffles.
4158,4158,4158,4159,4,"Finally-a Gluten Free Pancake product! Pancakes not to bad, taste like regular Bisquick. the batter is just right, not too heavy pancakes. this was a good price compared to local grocers."
4159,4159,4159,4160,5,This is a very versital product!!!! Love it. My husband must eat gluten free and my kids prefer pancakes made with this!
4160,4160,4160,4161,5,"My son who has Celiacs LOVES the pancakes you can make from these, and so do I...and I will eat them, even though I don't need to eat GF! Highly recommend!"
4161,4161,4161,4162,5,"I have now served Gluten Free Bisquick Pancake and Waffle Mix to several of our friends and relatives. I usually make waffles and have even done a taste test with regular Bisquick and 5 people. Everyone liked gluten free best!  I am so happy that I can buy it on Amazon as it is twice as much in the grocery stores.  Thank you for carrying this great product.<br />Alice Miller, Modesto, CA"
4162,4162,4162,4163,5,"After searching many local stores to find this product I ordered it via Amazon.  I took the advice of other reviewers & ordered the 3 pack.  I've only made pancakes w/ it, but they are delicious.  Some complain that they are bland.  I always add a little something to flavor my pancakes.  A few drops of vanilla & a sprinkle of cinnamon had these pancakes tasting wonderful!  My 2 yr old loved them.  I highly recommend you try the GF Bisquick."
4163,4163,4163,4164,5,"I've been gluten-free for a little over a year and I've struggled with finding tasty and affordable alternatives to my favorite foods. The great thing about this mix is that it's really easy to make, affordable, and the pancakes are so tasty, my children do not object to eating them--saving me the time of making two batches of pancakes. If they didn't see me eating them, I don't even think my kids would notice that they are eating gluten-free pancakes."
4164,4164,4164,4165,1,"Been gluten free for 7 years now. Thought we were done with mixes that tasted awful.  We threw it away because we did not like it. For my money, you can't beat Pamela's baking mix. But, the Betty Crocker chocolate chips are the BEST! So, don't give up Betty Crocker, just work on this one!"
4165,4165,4165,4166,5,"Wow... it's delicious!<br />The kids Love it!<br />We made it for breakfast this morning... the pancakes were eaten in no time at all!<br />The only complaint was that there wasn't more!<br />(actually, it was disappointing that the boxes weren't bigger)"
4166,4166,4166,4167,4,"The first time I tried this product to make pancakes, I thought it was terrible.  I made it according to the directions and used the ""right"" measuring cups for liquid and dry ingredients, but found that the batter came out thin and the texture was gummy.  Then, one day when I was visiting my mother, she decided to make pancakes, and since I am GF, she had bought this mix for me (not knowing I had already hated it).  I saw that she measured the ingredients ""incorrectly"" as she used the same measuring cup (generally used to measure liquids) for both the dry and the liquid ingredients.  She also used a whisk to mix the ingredients.  Amazingly enough, the pancakes came out fluffy, and I really liked it.  In fact, it is my favorite gluten free pancake mix so far.  Having said that, both my husband and I are of the opinion that this product still has a bit of the gritty texture that is present in many gf products.  However, it is the best pancake mix that I have found so far."
4167,4167,4167,4168,5,Best bisquick pancakes I've ever made!  I think these are better than the original Bisquick pancakes.  My husband even loved these!  I would recommend buying this product!
4168,4168,4168,4169,5,"You won't find a better gluten free pancake mix out there.  As a matter of fact, I much prefer these gluten free pancakes to regular pancakes (and I buy them for my husband).  I love bisquick for this product!"
4169,4169,4169,4170,5,"When I found GF Bisquik in the stores, I was happy. When I found it on Amazon with a good price as a subscription, I was thrilled. Our daughter lives in Texas and is gluten intolerant so I mail her items on a regular basis. This has become a staple in her kitchen. Anything you can make with regular Bisquik you can adapt using this. So now she makes cookies, pancakes and biscuits to her heart's content. Taste and texture of items made with it are good."
4170,4170,4170,4171,4,"It makes good tasting gluten free food... but... like most gluten free food, it's expensive and it's got a slight grit to it. I've made biscuits, waffles, and pancakes with it... a friend made some awesome banana bread with it. it's very good for gluten free..."
4171,4171,4171,4172,5,It's great! I actually used this to make gf donuts the other day. I love how convenient it is. It's so hard being gluten free so this is god sent for how many things you can make with this. I have celiacs and I haven't had any sort of negative reaction to this. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who can't have gluten but still wants things like pancakes and waffles and donuts and other fun things.
4172,4172,4172,4173,3,"The first brand of GF pancake mix I attempted was Bob's Red Mill and I loved it. I went to the store to try to find it again and this was all they had so I tried it. It's... okay. I'm egg-free too and used mushed banana instead, so maybe that contributed to the slight mushy texture but I made a batch of egg ones for my in-laws and they said it was a bit mushy too.<br /><br />It's not horrible, but I prefer BRM brand personally."
4173,4173,4173,4174,5,"We use this mix for pancakes and waffles and it's perfect. We have had a terrible time finding a good all purpose flour that is gluten free (the popular brands taste terrible!) so we tend to use this pancake mix as a base for a lot of our recipes--- including breading for baked chicken and other things. It's definitely best as a pancake mix of course, but using it as a starting point for baking has helped us find ""normal"" tasting gluten free baked foods. :)"
4174,4174,4174,4175,5,I recently went gluten free and this is one of my favorite mixes.  I used it for biscuits and pancakes and it's very good.  You can also use it for pizza dough and to make fried chicken - it's about average for that.
4175,4175,4175,4176,5,"I could not believe how great this mix tasted...it's like eating the regular one.  It came out soooooo good, fluffy and delicious!!!!!"
4176,4176,4176,4177,5,"I find it hard to express how pleased I was to find Bisquick in a gluten free form.  I have tried countless recipes using mixtures of rice, and potato flour and none of them tasted good.  The Bisquick bisquits are delicious, but unfortunatly I couldn't make satisfactory dumplings with the mix."
4177,4177,4177,4178,5,My son loves these pancakes. Much healthier alternative to the original. I am excited to try the other recipes soon.
4178,4178,4178,4179,5,"If you only knew....<br /><br />Bisquick Gluten Free(GF) is by far one of the best options out there for people with Celiac or Sensitivity to Gluten.<br />I honestly don't know how healthy it is for you. What I do know it that it is a great option for people trying<br />to eat as normal as possible. This GF option has been a great meal saver for my wife who this last year was diagnosed<br />with Celiac and got sick in tired of tasting gross tasting GF options or super simple meat and vegetables options for meals.<br /><br />We have made all types of breakfast items, biscuits, even fried food (chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, fried fruit,...) We bout our own little frier<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0016NQ49Q/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=talkinhome-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B0016NQ49Q&adid=0XK6HZPJRKAED855HEWP<br /><br />In short, It has not only been a great option, but also has been quite tasty allowing my wife to make one meal for both of us not worrying that<br />it will taste bad to me.<br /><br />Hope this was helpful."
4179,4179,4179,4180,5,I find it really hard to believe this is GF because it tastes better than any GF product I've EVER had. I made waffles with it this morning and I didn't even want butter or syrup! It was THAT amazing! I want proof that this truly GF...
4180,4180,4180,4181,5,"This is a great product for us gluten free people.  We use it for everything....From pancakes, waffles, to cookies, scones, cooking."
4181,4181,4181,4182,5,So grateful for this!! What an amazing mix. It can be used to make some of the best gluten free products out there. What a break through for us gluten free individuals who miss REAL mixes. Some of the other ones on the market just dont do the trick like this does :)
4182,4182,4182,4183,5,I've tried many gluten free products on the market and this is by far the easiest and more yummiest product yet!!  Thank you Betty Crocker!!!
4183,4183,4183,4184,5,"Thank you thank you thank you.....I have an intolerance for Gluten and Bisquick is my hero. I have tried some of those other packed product and invested in loads of ingredients to make my own mix but ""Bisquick"" has saved me from myself. Again thank you thank you thank you"
4184,4184,4184,4185,5,"My children can not have wheat, gluten, soy, dairy, eggs...  It is very hard to find products that they can have.  We use this for pancakes, pizza crust, cakes.  Basically we just use it in place of flour.  It is so nice to be able to buy Bisquick in the grocery stores now; however it is much cheaper through Amazon!"
4185,4185,4185,4186,2,"I was hoping Bisquick got it right when they released this product, but they missed their mark.<br /><br />I made both biscuits and dumplings (chicken & Dumplings). The biscuits came out okay but the flavor was bland. The dumplings were fluffy but not very flavorful and turned hard after a day or two."
4186,4186,4186,4187,4,"My husband is gluten intolerant and as with all gluten free products out there the results are not always the best.  He loves this product and since I only really make the pancakes I can't say how the other Bisquick recipes would turn out for any of you.  And yes he has this texture and taste thing with gluten free products as well...  gritty, sandy or off tasting.... etc. etc...  So I am happy he likes this one!  With gluten free products you really have to test them out one by one as some perform in the taste and texture area better than other blends.  My advice to anyone searching for gluten free products they want to try that it is best to buy them in the single packages, if possible.  I know on Amazon they sell them in bulk but if you find that you don't like it you are then stuck with alot of packages you no longer want!  Just a tip for all of you out there.  It may cost more for one package but the waste will be much less unless you donate them to the local food bank...  Good product and great results!  Thank you, Bisquick!"
4187,4187,4187,4188,4,"I like the Bisquick, it works great in a variety of uses. Wish it came in a bigger box, the recipes are good on the box though."
4188,4188,4188,4189,5,"Neither myself nor my husband can have any type of corn products, but we love cornbread.  This mix makes biscuits that taste just like corn bread to us.  Nice to find an alternative that tastes so great!  Appreciate having this order size option as well since it's often missing from grocery store shelves."
4189,4189,4189,4190,5,I love this!  Such a great product for all us gluten free folks!  It works the same as the regular Bisquick. Their website has tons of gf recipes too!  This makes delicious pancakes and 'magic crust' pies. Yummy!
4190,4190,4190,4191,5,This is great as a pancake mix.  It almost has a corn texture to it.  I rate everything by if my son will eat it.  He is super picky and loves the pancakes.  I tried making biscuits with the mix that didn't turn out very well but as far as pancakes it rocks.
4191,4191,4191,4192,5,"Great taste, texture, flavor, and works well with any recipe! Wonderful pricing, too! Gluten free products are so expensive normally! Definitely recommend this!"
4192,4192,4192,4193,5,I received this item on time.  The packaging was great.  The gluten free Bisquick is a great addition to our gluten free pantry.
4193,4193,4193,4194,3,"I was disappointed when I tried this pancake mix. Before going gluten free, Bisquick was our go-to pancake mix, so I had high expectations for the gluten free mix. The texture was a little weird. Soft and dry. I prefer the Pamela pancake mix over this one."
4194,4194,4194,4195,5,"I first discovered ""Gluten Free Biscuit"" in the supermarket.  I bought it and loved it.  I then tried to find it again in all the local supermarkets, but could not find it.  I called the manufacturer and they informed me that I could purchase it at Amazon.  I was thrilled. Amazon is one of my favorite web sites."
4195,4195,4195,4196,5,I had no idea there was a gluten free Bisquick mix..I made pancakes and they were great and the tea cakes also...
4196,4196,4196,4197,5,Bisquick has made a wonderful gluten free product.  From pancakes to biscuits and everything in between are light and fluffy! Garlic and Cheddar or Cinnamon and sugar is a great addition.
4197,4197,4197,4198,4,"In trying to eat a little healthier I'm reducing my gluten intake (gluten/wheat may not be the best for arthritis/inflammation) so I gave this gluten free Bisquick a try. Surprisingly, I was pretty impressed with the flavor which to me tastes almost as good as regular Bisquick.<br /><br />I followed a reviewer's suggestion to let the batter sit for about 15 minutes after adding just the milk; the batter looked better and was a nicer consistency after the resting time. It was a little hard to get all the lumps out of the batter though and because I have limited GF experience I wasn't sure whether further stirring would gum it up so I left some lumps in and they dissolved while cooking.<br /><br />The texture of the cooked pancakes was very SLIGHTLY gritty. Makes pancakes a little thinner than with regular Bisquick however thick enough that I'd say they are just right. See photo added.<br /><br />I used a cast iron griddle to make the pancakes, which made them barely crisp outside and nice tender inside - *very* good!!!<br /><br />The taste is close to regular Bisquick but a little more ""plain"" - I use real maple syrup and sometimes preserves and with either of the two toppings, I had a very good, very tasty short stack.<br /><br />My only quibble is that this mix is a little pricey but I'd rather buy this mix than other GF products I've tried that are just as pricey and don't taste nearly as good."
4198,4198,4198,4199,2,"I love pancakes, so giving up gluten was hard for me.  I've used Bisquick for pancakes for years with great results.  Alas, the best I got from the Gluten-Free version was edible, but not enjoyable.  It tasted a lot like pillow foam, not in a good way.  I will probably keep the mix for breading things, but not for pancakes.  I've found much better options."
4199,4199,4199,4200,5,I have this on auto ship because I use it so much. I have gone to every grocery in AZ and the cheapest place is Amazon! This is a great product and whatever you make using this flour will taste great. My son has Celiac and is allergic to gluten. I have tried every pancake mix and this one is the one I settled for!
4200,4200,4200,4201,5,"This is a product that is delicious and easy to use. I made the pancakes with buttermilk and the recipe on the box just said milk. The buttermilk helped make the pancakes light and fluffy. I am a little disappointed that the box will only make one recipe that calls for two cups of the mix. I doubled my recipe for the pancakes which made 14<br />4 inch pancakes.  The recipe says it makes 10 pancakes with 1 cup of the mix. Those 10 pancakes must be silver dollar size.  I am looking forward to making the biscuits so I will have to open a second box to have enough mix. The recipe calls for eggs for biscuits and I never used eggs in my regular biscuits.  I am wondering if buttermilk would make these biscuits rise sufficiently? I have family members who can't eat eggs or milk so I must adapt recipes for them. It is a product I would purchase again. However, I used Subscribe and Save on Amazon and the time to receive the product was really long in my opinion--ordered Nov. 19th received Dec. 2nd. I know Thanksgiving was in the midst of that time period but I thought I would have received the product before Thanksgiving. I will try Subscribe & Save one more time to see if all things are so slow.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004391DK0"">Bisquick Pancake and Baking Mix, Gluten-Free, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>"
4201,4201,4201,4202,5,"These tasted so good! I was surprised because I have heard so many negative things about glutten free bread products. I would eat these by choice, not because I have to."
4202,4202,4202,4203,3,"This mix makes GREAT belgian waffles.  We tried biscuits and pancakes and we do far better form scratch with a standard GF flour.  It does make seriously great waffles though, and we go GF/DF on these.  The waffles freeze extremely well and reheat in the toaster quite nicely."
4203,4203,4203,4204,5,"We've tried Pamela's (second best), Bob's Red Mill and King Arthur's Gluten Free flour mixes.  For pancakes, waffles, breading, pie crusts, biscuits and dumplings, Bisquick has been the most reliable performer.  We whole heartedly recommend it for those who bake at home but need to avoid gluten!!"
4204,4204,4204,4205,5,"I found this product in a local Walmart, after trying vainly to find bread that i liked that is gluten free.  (Stay away from the Ener-G brand, in my opinion)<br /><br />I have been gluten free for 3 weeks now, and seriously craving bread products.  I made some pancakes this morning from this product, and wow!!  very tasty, very light, I needed to thin them a bit more to have them spread correctly, but, this was the first real carb product that was ""bread like"" that I have eaten in 3 weeks.  Needless to say, I ate too many, and now have a carb headache!  :)<br /><br />Seriously though, this product, used in moderation, may help you not miss your gluten products quite as much.  I look forward to making bisquits and some of the other recipes on the box.<br />Way to go on this product, -it strikes a home run in the gluten free market."
4205,4205,4205,4206,5,"I made delicious banana pancakes last week using this product and over the weekend, remade a family favorite from years ago, Chicken and Dumplings, which was on the Betty Crocker Website under GF.  We couldn't tell the difference between the GF and regular mix in the dumpling results.  I made the recipe from scratch for six, using chicken breasts and thighs simmered till tender in chicken broth, baby carrots, celery, cut green beans, onion and seasonings and stirred up some white gravy to pour over the dish before serving.  Husbie loved it."
4206,4206,4206,4207,5,I use this to quickly make gluten/egg/dairy free pancakes.  I use rice milk and EngerG egg replacer to make pancakes. They taste pretty good and are a good snack to make for later and store in the fridge.  They're especially good w/either apple butter or peanut butter on them besides the usual maple syrup!
4207,4207,4207,4208,4,"This stuff is pretty solid. Makes a decent enough pancake for being GF and makes a solid biscuit as well. What we have found works best is taking this mix and using it half and half with the Chebe mix. Between the two it makes for a very nice flour mix. The Chebe is good but on its own tends to be a little squishy, but when you mix it with the bisquick, the bit of squishiness gives the dryer Bisquick the fluffiness and moistness it needs. So, I recommend this, but I would HIGHLY recommend getting some Chebe too and cutting the Bisquick with it. Also, even though this mix has leavening agents in it, when we use recipes that call for leavening agents we add them anyway, it tends to turn out better this way."
4208,4208,4208,4209,5,"I run a small bed and breakfast, and bought this product so I could prepare recipes for my guests that have a Gluten Allergy and they love it.  There are many recipes on the box, and even more on their website.  Quick,Easy, Inexpensive, what more could anyone ask for."
4209,4209,4209,4210,5,I have so many food allergies it's ridiculous! I am so happy that they made this product and that is available at a decent price. I was able to expand my meal plans and make stuff I thought I couldn't have anymore. I made a pizza with my family all in town using this and then a pizza using a different crust and the whole family liked my bisquick crust better. They said it was lighter and had more taste! I really enjoy finding things that make my crazy diet easier to deal with. Thank you thank you thank you.
4210,4210,4210,4211,5,Love this product!  Gluten free products have come a long way. Easy to use. Great for all your breakfast and baking needs!
4211,4211,4211,4212,5,This product is great for pancakes. For baked goods I blend Bisquick (2/3 part) with Pamela's bread mix (1/3 part) for great gluten-free/dairy-free treats. The bread mix makes it less crumbly.
4212,4212,4212,4213,5,"This product has helped our friend to be able to eat again.  She is going to college and finding things to eat has been hard. For her, we send her a supply every month so now she can make her own food and not get sick!"
4213,4213,4213,4214,5,You won't miss your old waffle/pancake mix when using this wonderful product.  I mix it with oatmeal in most cases and it makes wonderful waffles.  Pretty easy to give up gluten with this mix.
4214,4214,4214,4215,3,"It is good. I prefer the taste of baking mixes from scratch, but for store bought, it's pretty good. Much cheaper in local grocery stores. Under $5 per box at my local stores in Chicagoland area."
4215,4215,4215,4216,4,"Due to health issues, my husband is newly required to eat a gluten free diet. He acted as if he was on death row. Finding this product has help immensely. I can make him pancakes with fresh fruit and he doesn't feel he is being unfairly punished. Also, my neighbor was faced with a similar circumstance. I shared one of the boxes with her and she is now a fan! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004391DK0"">Bisquick Pancake and Baking Mix, Gluten-Free, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>"
4216,4216,4216,4217,5,"I have only had this once as banana pancakes so I'm not sure how it tastes without fruit, but it was the best pancake I've had in a long time.  Thank you for making a Gluten Free Bisquick, I will try biscuits with it next!"
4217,4217,4217,4218,5,"We use gluten free Bisquick to make coated baked chicken, waffles, pancakes, biscuits, chicken pot pie.  There are many recipes available to make quick easy meals.  We really like it.  Everyone can eat it instead of just making a gluten free meal for the one person who is gluten free. Reasonably priced for gluten free."
4218,4218,4218,4219,5,"My daughter has been GF for about 4 years now. We have discovered that if the main ingredient is rice flour, it usually isn't any good. It is usually grainy. This isn't the case with this product. It makes fantastic pancakes (the rest of the family would eat them). She didn't like the biscuits so we won't make those again.  We used it to make corn dogs and the entire family (and a friend) ate them. No one even noticed. Everyone LOVED them.<br /><br />Amazon has since taken this off of the Subscribe and Save. I am so mad. I hope they put it back on soon."
4219,4219,4219,4220,4,"I really love this product, I think it is a great overall flour replacement in your kitchen but I just felt the size was a bit small. I would have really loved to see the box be larger, I think there are three cups total in the box. Overall the product is amazing though. Everything I've made with it has come out wonderfully and all of the recipes online via Bisquick's website are easy to follow and come out very good. I'd highly recommend this product to anyone. My favorite things to make are the biscuits, I add a little cheddar to them to make them oh so good and the apple ""pie"" which is more like a coffee cake but good either way! Give it a shot if you are GF!"
4220,4220,4220,4221,5,"Finally a great and easy GF option for pancakes, waffles, biscuits, etc from Bisquick!! Both of my kids have Celiac and absolutley LOVE this stuff.  Wish the container was bigger. But we're just happy to have better tasting options for breakfast now. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.  Can't taste a difference, but the rest of the family uses the cheaper stuff."
4221,4221,4221,4222,5,Thanks to the Betty Crocker people for this GF option. It makes great pancakes and shortcakes for strawberries too. My onlycomplaint is I wish the box was bigger.
4222,4222,4222,4223,4,"I was so happy to find this product when it was first released! I had used regular Bisquick for years before being diagnosed with Celiac Disease. This is just as versatile as the original- pancakes, biscuits, dumplings, etc! My family's favorie is the pancakes, they are light and fluffy and have a lovely crispness to the outside.<br /><br />My only reason for not awarding this 5 stars is the size of the box, it is small. My family of 4 uses the entire box for Saurday morning pancakes. The box makes approximately 3 (small) batches of pancakes, we freeze the extra in single servings for weekday breakfasts. I'd love to see Bisquick release a larger box but until then I'll continue ordering the 3-pack! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004391DK0"">Bisquick Pancake and Baking Mix, Gluten-Free, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>"
4223,4223,4223,4224,5,I really love this mix as the pancakes are so soft and fluffy. Could not tell that they were gluten free. I also made carrot muffins with it and they turned out good.
4224,4224,4224,4225,4,"I grew up eating Bisquik, so finding a gluten-free version of the quintessential baking mix was wonderful.  However, a 16 ounce box only makes two batches of pancakes!  I would love it if the GF Bisquik could be made in a box size like the conventional Bisquik - especially since my family eats up the pancakes this makes even more than the regular ones."
4225,4225,4225,4226,5,"Due to my kid's food allergies I had to substitute eggs with ground flax with water, and 2 cups instead of one of rice milk, and some olive oil. Made great tasty pancakes!"
4226,4226,4226,4227,5,"I do a lot of ""from scratch"" gluten free cooking but there is nothing that can replace Bisquick. From the ease of morning pancakes to using it in other reciepes in place of other mixes there is simply nothing that I cannot do with this little box."
4227,4227,4227,4228,5,"I was really surprised when I tried this product because I found it to be a really light & fluffy batter. So don't think gluten free means flavorless, this Bisquick Pancake Mix will have you building up stacks of fluffy pancakes for your family. It's so nice that these are healthier for you, diabetic friendly and still manage to taste great too!"
4228,4228,4228,4229,5,This gluten free& milk free product is awesome! I am able to use almond milk in it instead of regular milk. It is great to have such a delicious & easy breakfast that doesn't make my stomach hurt!
4229,4229,4229,4230,5,"I'm new to trying GF, and most of the 'substitution products' I've tried so far are okay, but don't taste quite 'right.'<br />This was the exception.  The pancakes I made with the GF bisquick were light and smooth and delicious!  I couldn't tell a difference, unless maybe they were a bit better. A larger box would be better, but the product itself is wonderful.<br />Highly recommended!!"
4230,4230,4230,4231,4,"We found out last week that my son has MULTIPLE allergies, including milk, soy, wheat, tree nuts, oranges, tomatoes, corn (thus corn syrup and starch).

4232,4232,4232,4233,5,"Was very happy that the kids liked these! We all liked them! I bought this mostly for myself. I made them with coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil that it calls for.....it was a yummy, healthy substitute. Will definitely be buying again."
4233,4233,4233,4234,5,Hubby had to switch to gluten free because of gluten intolerance so we tried this and made pancakes. They were great and had sort of a corn bread texture to it. FYI: i made cobbler from an regular bisquick recipe (not gluten free) and the measurements do not transfer. The proportions are different with the gluten free mix so make sure you have the right recipe for what you're making.
4234,4234,4234,4235,4,"My family loves Bisquick Pancakes, my kids did not notice the difference from this product and regular pancakes. The only problem is the price, I will try Pamelas this week, price seems more reasonable."
4235,4235,4235,4236,5,"I am going gluten free to test if I am sensitive to it, it is a good diet to be on anyway.<br /><br />This was very tasty in a pancake it was light and fluffy.  You do need to use a little more butter than usual but that makes it even better. They  fried up with uniform color and had a nice little brown edge letting me know they were done."
4236,4236,4236,4237,5,"It was worth the wait--Gluten Free Bisquick is just like the real thing!! Everything tastes the way you remember it. So make dumplings, pancakes or cheddar biscuits they are all as good as they can be!"
4237,4237,4237,4238,5,"I have missed Bisquick since I became gluten free and am so happy to see they have gone gluten free. I've only made pancakes so far, but they are wonderful."
4238,4238,4238,4239,5,"It was wonderful.  We made chicken nuggets.  It was light and coated the chicken very nicely.<br /><br />I highly encourage you to purchase this.  Taste pretty much like regular bisquick.  Has many uses flour, gravy, pancakes....excellent way to stretch your dollar."
4239,4239,4239,4240,5,"It tough to find good gluten free baking mixes but this one is smooth unlike some that are gritty, and makes just as easily as regular bisquick. It tastes just as good too."
4240,4240,4240,4241,5,"I am so happy that Bisquick came out with a gluten free version!  We've tried so many other brands of pancake and waffle mix, and hands down, Bisquick is the BEST!  We just made waffles this morning, and both my husband and I were floored at how good they were!  The outside was crisp and the inside was soft.  With that said, it's not that great for pancakes or coffeecake."
4241,4241,4241,4242,5,"My Mom's Impossible Veggie Pie was a staple in our house - especially once I became a vegetarian as a teen.  As an adult I served it regularly to my family.  Ten years ago when my celiac was diagnosed it was bye-bye veggie pie.  I do try to eat less processed foods but I really did rejoice when I heard about the GF Bisquick.  We had Impossible Broccoli Pie last night for the first time in a decade and it was wonderful.  The mix is just as easy to use as the non-GF alternative and produces the same results.  No crumbles!  How often do you see that in a GF product?  I bought a box at the grocer to test, then went directly to subscribe & save here.  This will be a staple in my GF kitchen."
4242,4242,4242,4243,5,"I've tried a few other mixes for pancakes, and they've been awful, but this one is really good. I should buy stock in the co., because people will be buying this product I'm sure."
4243,4243,4243,4244,5,"I made cheddar biscuits with this and they came out a little dry the first time, but i adjusted the recipe and they were amazing. I just added a little more milk and another egg. (we have chickens that lay very small eggs, so 3 of our eggs is like 2 large store bought ones.)"
4244,4244,4244,4245,5,This is an excellent product and I use it just like I used to utilize the regular Bisquick product.It works well with any recipe that calls for flour and quickening.
4245,4245,4245,4246,5,This is a blessing to those of us who are GF.  There are so many things we can make again now that we have Bisquick!  Not to mention that pancakes finally taste like pancakes again!  How nice to be able to have a biscuit with dinner again!  Since GF products are so expensive the best place to get it is at Amazon on the automatic shipment plan.  It's great!
4246,4246,4246,4247,5,"As tasty as the regular (gluten) product. Only drawback is that you don't get a lot of mix for your money. Half of the box is needed to make their 12 pancake recipe. On a good note, it's nice to have options - by far though, this was the best pancake mix I've tried...and I tried a lot!"
4247,4247,4247,4248,5,This makes the best waffles that I have had in years. I will be glad to see more in grocery stores in our area
4248,4248,4248,4249,5,A great way to make cheese biscuits for the Celiac.  I serve to guests and they cannot believe that my Celeiac husband can eat them as they are sooooo good!!! Who says Gluten free has to taste bad!!!
4249,4249,4249,4250,5,"(I'm the member of my family who needs to avoid wheat products.)<br />I like this even more than the regular Bisquick mix, when I make pancakes.<br />Its taste is closer to that of my from-scratch wheat flour pancakes.<br />Other members of my family have not tried it, yet, and I haven't used it in  a pizza crust or biscuits."
4250,4250,4250,4251,5,"We LOVE the new gluten free Bisquick! I used to for cheddar biscuits mostly until we found out that we had a milk protein intolerance. Now, we are using this to make so many more recipes because it is dairy free and from what I can tell allergen free. The only thing I would like better (General Mills-if you are listening-I know I am not the only one that wants this) is if it came in bulk packaging. Just put the GF Bisquick in a larger box like the regular Bisquick and then sell in a 3 or 6 pack. Just mark that this review was helpful if you agree and maybe GM will listen! LOVE THIS-ORDER NOW!!"
4251,4251,4251,4252,5,"I usually make my own gluten free stuff from scratch and I love it, but the days when i feel lazy i feel like using a mix, and this one has to be the best one yet. Their mix tastes closely like the real (wheat) thing. I have made the pancakes, waffles, oven baked chicken, and strawberry shortcakes... absolutely delicious"
4252,4252,4252,4253,5,"Our family has been wheat-free for 3 years and gluten-free for 1 1/2 so we've tried just about every mix out there.  I just found that Bisquick has a GF mix while in the grocery store and decided to give it a try.  This is DEFINITELY the best mix that we have ever tasted: smooth, not grainy.  I don't know that side-by-side with regular wheat pancakes that you would notice the difference!"
4253,4253,4253,4254,5,"This is one of the most versatile mixes I've found, and most recipes come out tasting very much like the Full of Gluten Blends. I, like many, am struggling with celiac's disease, and I've only just found out I have it, so I'm not quite sure what to buy, what's healthy, and what doesn't taste like cardboard.<br /><br />Gluten Free is a way of life you have to adjust to in almost every way, from giving up many favorites, to training your pallet to love these new found grains.<br /><br />Bisquick is Rice based, and is very much like it's original version, however be aware that the pancakes will be a little less fluffy and that you should follow the recipe to the T when it comes to these. Betty Crocker has a Recipe website they've published for you using this product that has quite a few tasty treats you'll love. When it calls for Vegetable Shortening, be sure to use it, for example, biscuits made without shortening, and only butter will be very dry and not very satisfying, even difficult to swallow. Use recipes that include shortening, and will result in moist, fluffy foods and breads will help you end up with an enjoyable addition to your meal.<br /><br />Fun and Tasty Gluten Free Recipes for this mix can be found on the Betty Crocker website, they won't allow me to post the link here, sorry.<br /><br />UPDATE: ** Fun Tip about this and other Gluten Free Mixes, My mom Figured out that when you're mixing together your ingredients and you're using one that calls for milk, that if you mix together ONLY the BASE MIX and the MILK and let it set for about 15 minutes before continuing with your recipe and adding other ingredients, the end result is much fluffier and tastier **  This would be much like making tapioca pudding, you have to let the milk and tapioca soak to 'activate the tapioca' before moving on, so I think that type of reaction is what's happening here with the Bisquick Mix. YAY for Mom!<br /><br />Hope that helps you with your purchasing decision.<br />Thanks for reading!"

4255,4255,4255,4256,5,"I have been GF for the past year and have tried all sorts of flour alternatives. This one is certainly the best, and the best part about it, is you can substitute it for any creation that calls for original bisquick. The best so far is the waffles that you can make following the directions on the back. I will be ordering again!! My only complaint is that the boxes are small compared to the other boxes of bisquick available on the shelves."
4256,4256,4256,4257,5,"This is excellent.  This is the best GF mix I've yet to try in over five years of trying it all.  It's not grainy, none of that rice grainy thing going on AT ALL.  The texture of everything I've used it for has been excellent.  This is a winner.  The price is a bummer, but the product is amazing."
4257,4257,4257,4258,5,"I bought this product uncertain that it would be worth the money, and quickly came to love it. I made gf Biscuits and gravy for my family and we didn't mention that it was all gluten free. Everyone loved the biscuits. They didn't fall apart at all like a lot of other brands do. I used butter flavored shortening and I think it made the biscuits even more delicious. If you haven't tried it yet, try it now. I now buy a box a week. Amazon has a much better price than I can find in most stores in Vegas."
4258,4258,4258,4259,2,"Overall, this mix is okay, but, the sugar content is very, very high. You can actually see the sugar in the mix if you look closely. For pancakes or waffles, this is fine, but for savory concoctions, this is not acceptable. Sausage balls, casseroles, and biscuits all come out almost inedible.This mix is also oddly gritty. The grit is very fine, but still makes my teeth want to curl.  I recommend Pamela's baking and pancake mix, as it is smoother, and much more versatile, because it's not as sweet. A good cook knows you can always add more of something, but you can't take it out if you've added too much.<br /><br />That being said, if you're traveling and this is the only mix they have, it's better than nothing."
4259,4259,4259,4260,2,I was so excited to get this and try it.  Unfortunately I'm not impressed.<br /><br />For starters the value is terrible.  You get 3 cups of mix per box.  That's enough to make 1 batch of pancakes and 1 batch of biscuits (or 3 batches of pancakes whatever).  For almost 4.50 a box that's not worth it to me especially when the end result is mediocre at best.  For the biscuits I made cheddar biscuits and not even the bread loving toddler would eat them.  The pancakes were okay if I used twice as much real maple syrup as I normally do.<br /><br />The pro's?<br />The biscuits did puff up nicely.  That's the only pro I have.
4260,4260,4260,4261,5,"The best gluten free mix I've tried.  Of the recipes on the box I can vouch for the pancakes and the waffles- the biscuits were edible if not enjoyable.  The pancakes and waffles also freeze well.  I also recommend Betty Crocker's ""Glutenfree Recipe Collection"" magazine for extra recipes to try with or without this mix. From the magazine I have thus far made the chicken and dumplings (the dumplings disintegrate a bit too easily but are still good) and the fruit swirl coffee cake (I used a full can of pie filling per 8X8- I used apple and lemon pie fillings.  I thought the cake tasted rather like a cobbler or dry danish pastry).  The mix is quick, it's easy, it tastes good, and it is versatile.  And hey- although the packaging of the mix into the little boxes is a bit of a pain it does serve to keep the mix fresh!"
4261,4261,4261,4262,5,"My daughter was diagnosed with celiac about 2 years ago, and has gone without pancakes ever since...until I happened to come across this at the grocery store.  Really wasn't expecting good results - but it's very good!  The non-celiac members of the family even prefer the gf version to the regular!  Try it!"
4262,4262,4262,4263,5,"We've tried so many gluten free products and this one was by far the best. I've made pancakes, waffles, biscuits and the chicken recipe for the whole family with this and they can not tell the difference. Pamela's is a good mix too but this one is much better. It is expensive but when you've got a loved one who is gluten intolerant you're just thankful to have options for them. I can find it at some of my grocery stores but not all. You just have to check and see who carries it and then try a box. It's worth it!"
4263,4263,4263,4264,5,"I have been using G/F products for the past 4 years and it is good to see more main stream companies getting the religion.  The product works, the pancakes and waffles have come out beautifully."
4264,4264,4264,4265,5,"We cant say enought about the Gluten Free Bisquick.. My husband and all three kids are allergic to Wheat and we are on a strick Gluten Free diet in our house.. I have tried every product out there to make pancakes, waffles, biscuits and even chicken fingers and was so pleasantly suprised that this little box does it all and does it all WONDERFUL... Pancakes are wonderful, Waffles are Great, Chicken Fingers are the best Ive made and the biscuits are delish.. Cant ask for anything better.. I only wish you could buy it ina bigger box and it was a little cheaper but we are a HUGE fan..."
4265,4265,4265,4266,5,"I love this. I have celiac, so this was the first time I had pancakes. I loved them, so did the rest of the family(they can eat wheat)."
4266,4266,4266,4267,5,"This Bisquick Gluten Free mix is amazing.  I haven't had a biscuit or banana bread in over a year and now I just can't stop making things.<br />I just made Banana Bread (for the 3rd time with this mix) and my family loves it.  I use it for everything, I am so pleased.  I made a cherry pie, Cheddar Biscuits.  I've been<br />using my old Bisquick recipes from ages ago and it is working fine.  I am so thankful for Amazon and their items.  I sure keep the UPS guy<br />busy."
4267,4267,4267,4268,5,"I love this Bisquick Mix!  Over the past 10 years, since being diagnosed wheat gluten intolerant, I have tried so many gluten free mixes that were so bad I ended up feeling like I might as well be eating the box!  This Bisquick mix is by far the best I have found for making scones (plain or sweet) and biscuits!  The Orange biscuits, cheddar biscuits and raisin scones I have made were delicious. It was easy to substitute this mix into my old recipes, because unlike some gluten free mixes, I found I can play around with this and don't have to measure everything absolutely precisely to get a good outcome.  Of course, you can't roll this dough out like traditional dough, it has to be dropped onto the baking sheet in spoonfuls.  I have found that if I don't make it too sticky, I can gently form the balls in my hands to give a more regular shape to my scones and biscuits. I have also used it for making deep dish chicken pie and pizza (be sure you press it nice and thin in the pan - I use a silicone spatula to press it so that it doesn't stick). Bisquick Mix is made by the Betty Crocker company and this, along with the Betty Crocker cakes and brownie mixes, allows me to indulge in delicious baked goods again!  I have Bisquick Mix on Subscribe and Save, which makes it very affordable and makes sure that I don't ever run out!"
4268,4268,4268,4269,5,"I absolutely LOVE this product - being able to have pancakes was my original goal - however - I made the pizza with it & was absolutely thrilled about the pizza<br />These are small boxes (makes two pizzas per box), but I would highly recommend - I am reordering a pack of three now!"
4269,4269,4269,4270,5,WOW!  Thank you BISQUICK for coming up with a gluten free product.  I tried it and it works wonderfully.  So far I have used ot for waffles (recipe on the box) which were excellent and a baked chicken and SPIKE recipe which was also wonderful.  Anyone needing gluten free products will like this.
4270,4270,4270,4271,5,"After my husband's enthusiastic reaction to the glutin-free Bisquick biscuits,I rediscovered an old Bisquick recipe booklet and used its recipe to make an ""impossible"" cherry pie. He loved it! Next I'll try the Impossible Pecan Pie. This is the first gluten-free product that my husband really likes.  I will buy again although I'd like to find it packaged/sold less expensively than on Amazon."
4271,4271,4271,4272,5,"I like the ease of this mix. I haven't tried anything but pancakes. They were great! I did add cottage cheese to my mix to add protein, which made them less fluffy but not less tasty. I can't wait to try this mix for chicken. I really miss fried chicken."
4272,4272,4272,4273,5,"Can as be used to make cookies - even egg free!  I just used the mix, enough apple sauce to make a batter, some coconut butter and added vanilla and cinnamon and baked.  turned out soft delicious cookies with only 5 minutes from box to the oven.  However, even wallmart carries this for about one dollar per box less than here."
4273,4273,4273,4274,5,"This is really a great product.  Works and tastes just like the gluten product.  Our son is a celiac and we have tried a lot of products.  We rate this ""crossover"" brand one of the best."
4274,4274,4274,4275,5,"It was recently suggested to me I try going gluten-free to battle an autoimmune thyroid disorder.  I bought the Gluten-Free Bisquick hoping the pancakes would at least be edible.  The Bisquick has far exceeded my expectations!  The pancakes are light, fluffy, and delicious!  I definitely recommend this product!"
4275,4275,4275,4276,5,"I was so excited when Bisquick came out with the gluten free version, but I was frustrated with the length of time it took for me to get a hold of some.  I did finally order some through Amazon, and today I made pancakes using the mix.  Due a milk allergy, I made them with soy milk (the original 'flavor') and I added a little double strength vanilla. They were fantastic and my family and guests gobbled them up.  I will definitely make them again and try some of the other recipes.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004391DK0"">Bisquick Pancake and Baking Mix, Gluten-Free, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>"
4276,4276,4276,4277,5,"We just bought this the other day because for about 2 years we have found that biscuits are a very hard wheat/gluten free item to make...I LOVE IT!!! I even went further and put holes in the middle of the biscuit dough, flattened them a bit and then fried them in a bit of oil, sprinkled with sugar and had DOUGHNUTS! My 3 year old feels like he is getting a treat!"
4277,4277,4277,4278,5,"Not gritty like a lot of GF mixes.  I make the whole box at once and keep them in the fridge, pop 'em in the toaster oven in the morning."
4278,4278,4278,4279,1,"Second ingredient is SUGAR! Need I say more? Make your own bisquit mix, it's super easy!"
4279,4279,4279,4280,2,"I made pancakes and biscuits with this mix and found them to be mediocre at best.  I really tried to like this product, but the taste is just so far off -- for me.  I wanted a break from making things from scratch, but this just was not worth it."
4280,4280,4280,4281,2,"I ran out of Pamela's mix and bought this in a regular grocery store because it was all they had.  I followed the pancake recipe on the back.  As a person with celiac who has tried many things, I knew when I saw the fine, crystalline mix it wasn't going to be good.  The batter is pasty looking.  The pancakes were too dense and slightly off.  The end product was pretty bland.  You will be much better off with Pamela's mix.  Pamela's can be served to a gluten eater; I cannot say the same for this product."
4281,4281,4281,4282,2,"The rice flour in it is a crude gritty grade (cheap?). If you've ever used Thai rice flour <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYC096"">Thai Rice Flour - 16 oz</a>, you know that rice flour does not need to be this unpleasantly gritty.<br /><br />I tried compensating for the grit by using Bisquick Gluten Free to make Johnny cakes since the cornmeal is sort of gritty. But sadly, after you chew you are still left with this unpleasant grit like fine sand in your mouth."
4282,4282,4282,4283,1,I made the waffles and was not impressed.<br />Definitely not worth the expense!<br /><br />It's only redeeming quality was that I seasoned it to bread oven fried pork chops.<br />I would rather have saved my money and made up a flour mix from scratch.
4283,4283,4283,4284,1,"Thought I had died and gone to heaven when I made the bisquit recipe.  I was wrong! Went to indigestion hell.  I had serious hope for this product. I truley loved the mix, but it didn't love me.  I haven't had indigestion since I gave up gluten until I ate a bisquit from this mix.  Best luck on getting it right bisquick."
4284,4284,4284,4285,1,"I will first say that I have only tried making pancakes with GF Bisquick. My family's experience with these pancakes, however, was very disappointing, and I will not be trying any other recipe. I have tried Betty Crocker's GF Brownies, and loved them, so when I decided to spend a little extra and try GF Bisquick I was greatly let down by the result. We couldn't even finish them, we just threw them out. If you can tolerate tree nuts and milk products, I recommend trying Pamela's Pancake Mix. Otherwise, if you are looking for great GF pancakes, look elsewhere - GF Bisquick is not worth it, in our opinion."
4285,4285,4285,4286,4,"I wish some of these companies would say whether the rice is white or brown rice. I try very hard to just eat the whole grain version of any grain as they are more nutrient dense(plus lower glycemic). I've not tried this yet, but if it was listed as brown rice flour, I would have put it in my cart."
4286,4286,4286,4287,2,"My personal preference is to stay clear of this. I did not like the smell or taste. I was attempting to make pizza crust for the first time. On my second attempt it came out better, but I did not like the taste of it. If I at least liked the taste, I would buy again and make my crust very thin."
4287,4287,4287,4288,2,"I bought these for pancakes, and I haven't used it to make any other recipes, so I cannot speak for how it makes biscuits, or any other item. But for pancakes, it's a no-go. They have a hint of pancake-flavor with lots of butter & syrup; but I don't like smoothering my pancakes in fattening syrup, so these pancakes are NOT for me. Moving on to other mixes..."
4288,4288,4288,4289,3,"The only complaint I have about the product is the price and I wish it were organic as well.  Other than that it's a great, versatile mix.  I've used it for pancakes and cherry cobbler : )."
4289,4289,4289,4290,4,"Just in case you don't know - these are about $4 a box at the store, so anything more than $12 for a 3 pack is not worth it.  This is a great product, though (that's what the 4 stars are for).  The pancakes & pizza dough are great, I make them all the time."
4290,4290,4290,4291,4,This product is so useful in managing a Gluten-free diet!  The inced. price @ Amazon .com makes it all a great buy.
4291,4291,4291,4292,4,"In the summer my doctor suspected I had a gluten sensitivity. She wanted me to start making changes from packaged food and think about cutting out gluten. After a bad few months I did some research and found this bisquick. I have only made one thing so far, garlic cheese biscuits. They were very tasty and had no strange texture or flavor. They had a more spongey texture than a crumbly biscuits but I was halving the recipe so maybe that was why. I nibbled on a biscuit hours out of the oven and it was still as soft and tasty. I can't wait to try pancakes and coffee cake. The only draw back is how small the box is for the price! I will limit the use to once a week or so for a treat!"
4292,4292,4292,4293,4,This is one of the best GLUTEN-FREE mix on the market!!! It makes fluffy pancakes and light cornbread.  Also it is a great price!  I have had different mixes on the market in all price ranges and this is the best!!!
4293,4293,4293,4294,4,I used the Bisquick Pancake and Baking GF mix to make snickerdoodle cookies.  They were very good and stayed fresh for some time.  Thank you for offering this mix.
4294,4294,4294,4295,4,"I purchased this while out of town.  We used it a couple of times, but never for biscuits.  I did make pancakes out of it and they were pretty good.  Always use milk and butter.<br /><br />They are a bit heavy and have a slight slimy sense to them, but are significantly better than a lot of stuff out there. I did also use it to thicken some gravy and it was fabulous for that.  I used it for breading for chicken nuggets as well and it was good.  I would like to try this again  for pancakes, and make some biscuits before I make a final decision on it."
4295,4295,4295,4296,1,"When I saw the ingredients on this box I knew it would be a disappointment. It would be much better and pretty easy just to make your own mix. Also, there are plenty of other quality mixes out there like Pamela's and Bob's Red Mill. This will be a huge disappointment to you so don't waste your money."
4296,4296,4296,4297,2,"Reading other reviews, I was excited to try this mix since it appeared to be Gluten free/dairy free.  Technically, the dry mix is GF/DF but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk.  Technically I can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then I could already do this with so many other mixes.  I've found that mixes that request eggs and/or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes.  The best GF/DF mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and/or oil or other non-dairy ingredients.  In this case, I will return to my old favorite mixes by ""The cravings place"" - these are truely targeted for a GF + DF lifestyle.  That said, if you are not DF then perhaps this is a fine choice. It would have been better to have a print/picture of the back of the package to more clearly see that this is not a great DF option."
4297,4297,4297,4298,2,"These pancakes are gross... they are pale and do not taste like pancakes. I bought these based on the reviews because the Maple Grove Farms pancakes were out of stock that week. I expected a lot more from Bisquick. I mean, when these pancakes are fully cooked they look like pale wafers of cream of wheat. If you leave them in a little longer to get some color, they just get hard and taste worse. I hate wasting food so I forced myself to finish the 3 boxes.. but I dont think I'll buy these again even if my other ones are out of stock. The only reason I gave these 2 stars is because they are gluten free. Other than that they're awful.. I'm so glad I've got my Maple Groves back this week and that these are out of my pantry!"
4298,4298,4298,4299,1,"Was awful. The sight of this in my pan made me sick...smells like POTATO  duh potato starch)...would not brown. My child laughed the entire time...as I complained because I was so hungry and thought I could have a late night pancake session. Totally not the case.  Yes, I am a GF newbie... I tossed the box!"
4299,4299,4299,4300,1,Pure toxic garbage. Eat poison if you want to. Toxic metals. Go ahead and buy this junk and feed yourself poison. Look at all the high ratings. Apparently people love eating toxic metals. Not harmful? Would you eat sodium mercury phosphate? Enjoy your metals.
4300,4300,4300,4301,1,A great idea that falls short. Bisquick gluten-free still uses an aluminum-based baking powder that is toxic to humans. Aluminum lodges in our bodies and has been found in quantities unacceptable in autistic individuals. The company refuses to respond to customer inquiries concerning this. I cannot give this to my family until the baking powder formula has been changed.
4301,4301,4301,4302,1,"I actually was delighted to find this product, and my family and I loved the recipes made with it.  However it has sugar as the 2nd ingredient AND worse it has aluminum in it.  Why would I intentionally feed my family something neuro-toxic when I am trying to avoid gluten to keep healthy?  I sure wish those companies who jump on the GF bandwagon would keep health in the equation.  My kids bowel movements are gluten free too, but I wouldn't serve it to them for breakfast.  Just sayin..."
4302,4302,4302,4303,5,"Our family has tried just about every gluten-free pancake mix on the market. Bisquick is one of the best! Two members of our family have celiac disease and three of us don't, but we all love this mix for our tradition of Saturday morning pancakes. The only other gluten-free pancake mix we like even better is: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005XP3R4I"">Nuffins Gluten Free Pancake Mix - Case of 6</a> It's not always available on Amazon, but when it is we try to stock up. Nuffins is definitely worth trying! Their other products are great too. Otherwise it's Bisquick or Pamelas for our family.<br /><br />The only ""con"" I can think of is the price. At $5.00+ per pound, this mix is expensive. If you agree, mark this review as helpful! Maybe the good folks at Betty Crocker will take notice."
4303,4303,4303,4304,5,"I bought this on a whim because I was craving strawberry shortcake... wow! The biscuits can be a bit crumbly, but the texture is not objectionable. The taste was great! I use this for sweet and regular biscuits.<br /><br />We also use this for pancakes, and they are almost indistinguishable from regular pancakes. I add vanilla, a touch of brown sugar and cinnamon for a treat. Yum!<br /><br />Tip - I've found that most gluten free ""bread"" products work better if you let the batter sit for about 15 minutes after mixing the dry and wet ingredients. It seems to activate the batter, which makes the resulting stuff lighter and more moist."
4304,4304,4304,4305,3,I love this mix. My favorite of any I've tried. The only reason I starred it at 3 is because this is not a deal. I can get 3 boxes at Walmart for less than 12 dollars but I have heard of some places seriously over pricing it in other states so YMMV.
4305,4305,4305,4306,5,"I have used Bisquick forever and now that I have Celiacs I use the GF Bisquick and I love it! There is little to no difference at all between the two. I have made biscuits, pot pie and pancakes and they are all awesome. I find most all other brands have an after taste and Bisquick doesn't. Even my daughter who does not have a problem with gluten loves it and thinks its better than regular Bisquick and she is only 5. I will buy this product all the time its my #1 baking mix :)"
4306,4306,4306,4307,1,"I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes.<br /><br />I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for:<br /><br />#1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and<br />#2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.<br /><br />Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt.<br /><br />Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum<br /><br />Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).<br /><br />That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.<br /><br />Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.<br /><br />Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for:<br />rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store),<br />sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) ,<br />potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store),<br />baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials),<br />salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's),<br />xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).<br /><br />Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.<br /><br />Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their ""mix"" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.<br /><br />I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.<br /><br />MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!<br /><br />Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.<br /><br />Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).<br /><br />To find the recipe, do a google search of ""betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.""<br /><br />Boo on Betty Crocker."
4307,4307,4307,4308,5,"When I first found out that my 4 year old I had to go Gluten free I was a little worried about how she would handle it. GF Bisquick has made it a lot easier. I have been able to make her favorite foods such as chicken fingers, corn dogs, pizza and chinese (sweet and sour chicken)with this mix. Pancakes are also a big hit in our house. They have quick and easy recipes on the box. For the chinese- I take their chicken finger recipe and cute the pieces of chicken into bite size pieces, and bake according to the recipe. Cook up some rice and just use a GF sweet and sour sauce a quick simple easy meal that tastes wonderful!"
4308,4308,4308,4309,3,"Having recently been placed on a gluten free regime, I felt I needed some quick and easy help to get me started. It works great but is way too expensive for what it is. There were just over three cups of bisquick in the box. When I read the ingredients, I realized I could quickly mix up my own quick bread flour and keep it in the fridge. I'm glad I tried this item because it taught me that I could do just as well on my own and save a great deal of money."
4309,4309,4309,4310,5,"This mix is great for biscuits, snicker doodles and homemade chicken nuggets. But in our house that is all. We have been GFree for 3 years and yes, I have a house hold with a husband and kids and we make A LOT of GF stuff for EVERYONE. We LOVE the Pamela's baking mix for pancakes/waffles and sweetbreads and their flour blend THE ULTIMATE BEST out of them all for bread and as a sub for regular wheat flour recipes. But I will buy this mix (and yes, I do agree it is AWFULLY EXPENSIVE) for those three things I've mentioned and in a GF household, usually you find that having a few different blends for different products is just the best thing to do for the best taste. Not one flour does the best with everything."
4310,4310,4310,4311,1,"I regularly purchase this item in the bulk and loved it because it was also dairy free.<br />However, my last purchase was disappointing, after opening a brand new package I noticed a black thing in the mix, carefully removed to find out it was a dead flour beetle! I sifted the mix and found more DEAD BUGS!<br /><br />This is the second time I writing this review. Amazon didn't publish my first review. Thank you AMAZON.<br />I will not be purchasing this item again."
4311,4311,4311,4312,1,"I have been Gluten Free Since 2003 and this is I think the worst tasting GF mix I have come across. I have found all to have their own pros and cons but this one have very little to brag about. I appreciate the effort anyone puts into a GF product but I couldn't buy this one again. It was like eating reconstituted potatoes that lookes like pancakes. No butter or gravy, just dehydrated spuds. The only real good thing to speak of was the texture. It was light and moist but I would have to seriously alter the recipe to add flavor."
4312,4312,4312,4313,5,"I have been GF for 2years.  I used this product for biscuits and liked them but were a little dry.  As for the pancakes, I prefer another product.  The pricing is outrageous.  I am single but cannot imagine trying to justify this cost when making pancakes for a family.  I love the Betty Crocker GF cake mixes and brownies though.  I still make my biscuits and oven baked chicken using this product.  It is getting more difficult to find on store shelves so most times I order here.  I have several BC cookbooks and have used the GF version Bisquick  as substitute for the regular Bisquick..  Some come out Ok while others are not too good.  I am learning to vary ingredients to achieve better results.  My best experiment with this product was my scratch cornbread.  I use GF corn meal and this mix to make a delicious bread.  thank you BC for this product.  Work on the pricing.  I would use it more often if I could afford it.  Tired of manufacturers holding GF people hostage because it seems to be the latest ""diet craze"".  GF people have to have these products to live.<br /><br />Going GF saved my life and BC now makes products so I can enjoy baked goods again.  I make my own breads using other products and now biscuits, cakes, cookies with this and other BC GF products.  I also use this product when recipes call for small amounts of regular flour.  It depends on what I am making.<br /><br />As I am reviewing the product I gave it 5 stars.  I give the pricing 2 stars."
4313,4313,4313,4314,4,"This product produces excellent (outstanding) Belgian waffles in my Waring Pro waffle iron.  They exceed anything you may buy in a restaurant.  Truly!  However, at $5 per box, the cost of the other ingredients you must add, time to prepare, and the small amount of product in the box, I suggest you look at other gluten-free products from Pamela's, The Gluten Free Pantry, Bob's Red Mill, or Arrowhead Mills.  You may see a better value for your food dollars.  Incidentally, Arrowhead Mills products are equally as tasty and easy to prepare, but I believe you are getting more product in the bag.  Feeding a family of 4 would be a crap shoot at best with a single box of this product.<br /><br />If the manufacturer were to repackage the product with more content per box and drop the price, I would have given it 5 stars. Safeway was the first store in San Francisco to offer this product and placed it in the center of its baking products.  Now, however, it has fallen to lowest shelf level with some prices sold by higher end grocers approaching $6 per box.  Forget it at those prices.  Hey, it's largely ultra fine white rice flour and super fine sugar!<br /><br />Bisquick would also benefit from a buckwheat GF product in its inventory.  I would certainly buy it."
4314,4314,4314,4315,2,"Now if you could just make it sugar-free also?  I know, I don't want for much.  :-)<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004391DK0"">Bisquick Pancake and Baking Mix, Gluten-Free, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>"
4315,4315,4315,4316,4,"Ok--I just bought BIsquick GF and the first thing I tried to make were the drop biscuits (recipe listed on the box).  These are not the kind that are rolled out & cut--these are ""drop ""biscuits.  The results were very tasty.  The taste of this GF bisquick is very much like the original, but the taste is not as tart as the original.  If you want a similar buttermilk taste, you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe.  I noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking; it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right.  I read the side of the box and it claims that there are 3 2/3 cups of mix in the box (11 servings of 1/3 cup each).  The biscuit recipe called for 2 cups of mix. I measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and I don't even have a cup of mix left in the bag?????  I know this mix doesn't have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently, maybe if I dug into the bag with a cup, I would have used less, but the recipe came out right.  So, there must be a misprint on the box.  I am assuming I measured properly because I have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy, smothered with butter & jam, or sliced to make those yummy McDonald's breakfast sandwiches. By following the instructions, I have A LOT of biscuits.  If you are single, or just cooking for two; you might want to cut the recipe in half.  You will still have plenty and you won't go through the box so quickly.  This mix cost me around $5.00 and I don't have enough left to make anything else, without buying another box; which I will because these biscuits are really, really good.  Still, if you are watching your budget, don't prepare more than you need.<br /><br />About these biscuits:  yummy, fairly golden (because the recipe calls for eggs), and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges, just like glutenous ones.  Without the eggs, you probably won't get the nice eye-appealing color.  Even though they are drop biscuits, you still have to cut-in shortening or margarine. If you don't have a cutter, you will need to use a long fork.  That is more difficult, so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits; buy a cutter.  It will cost you as much as a box of this mix.  The biscuit recipe also calls for milk, so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick; you will need to use buttermilk.<br /><br />The mix is made up of rice flour, sugar, leavening, potato starch, salt, & xanthum gum.  Many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy.  Bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour.  It is not grainy at all; I repeat, it is not grainy at all.  For those of you new to celiac cooking; using a starch such as corn, potato, or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that wouldn't be possible with rice flour alone.  Leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising.  The sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency,  and yes, they are necessary.  As for the Xanthum gum; it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac-safe baked goods a bit of elasticity (acting as a replacement for the gluten).  You will find Xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease.  Can you just make your own mix and spend less money?  Sure, but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix.<br /><br />The other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes, waffles, strawberry shortcakes, pizza crust, ultimate chicken fingers, and oven baked chicken.  You can find more recipes on their website.<br /><br />I recommend this product for the taste.  I do wish that more mix was in the box, for the price."
4316,4316,4316,4317,5,"Love this mix for pancakes!<br />Many GF products have other ingredients I'm allergic to, so finding something that tastes great and is convenient is pretty exciting. I make a batch of pancakes and freeze individual servings to microwave later.<br />Just had the yummy Cheeseburger pie for dinner last night, recipes can be found on Bettycrocker.com."
4317,4317,4317,4318,5,It is very nice to be able to have biscuits again.  I can only say they need to make a bigger box.  We run out way to fast.
4318,4318,4318,4319,5,"Love this!  It's so good and makes perfect pancakes.  Love that it's also dairy free.  My husband, who does not have gluten intolerance like I do, likes them as well.  Hard to tell a difference between this and the gluten-y version.<br /><br />I love companies that make gluten free versions of their foods!"
4319,4319,4319,4320,5,"We have tried a lot of different GF mixes and when I found this new mix from Bisquick, I decided to try it.  I made waffles for my family and even my kids couldn't tell they were GF.  They almost taster better than my original wheat recipe.  No strange texture or after taste."
4320,4320,4320,4321,3,"...this mix does have that grainy texture found with a lot of rice-based gluten-free mixes. The mix works well when the directions are followed and it is fairly versatile.<br /><br />I will use the mix I have, but I'm not sure if this will be a staple in my pantry. I'm not finding myself reaching for it on a regular basis, which is usually a sign that this isn't a hit in my household."
4321,4321,4321,4322,4,"I can't say that biscuits made from this mix taste as good as the regular wheat.  But that said, for those of us needing gluten free foods, it's not bad either."
4322,4322,4322,4323,5,I just recently had to go gluten free and have been disappointed by the gluten free flours and baking mixes.  I bought this and it's amazing!  Just like the original Bisquick.  Although it is cheaper at Walmart.
4323,4323,4323,4324,5,"When I discovered my sensitivity to gluten about 6 months ago, I was dismayed by most of the horrible gluten-free foods on the market. I have since found some substitute foods that are acceptable to me. Bisquick gluten-free pancake and baking mix is one of them. I use it every Sunday to make either pancakes or waffles. I recommend this mix whole-heartedly!"
4324,4324,4324,4325,3,"I bought this immediately after finding out I could no longer have gluten. From everything I was reading it seemed daunting to mix different flours to make anything.<br /><br />The boxes are SMALL!  While this mix is okay for making pancakes, the biscuits are alright, and to use it as a coating chicken fingers is 'eh', I'm glad I bought it when I was first diagnosed.  It helped ease my transition into gluten free cooking and baking.<br /><br />Now that I know what I'm doing, I will not buy again.  It's much cheaper to make my own flour mixes at home and use those to make pancakes, biscuits, and breaking for chicken fingers.  And my own mix tastes much better.  But, if you are new to gluten free, definetly pick this up, it will help with the transition!"
4325,4325,4325,4326,5,The absolute best baking product of its kind---I have tried almost ALL gluten-free baking products and Bisquick Gluten Free is by far the BEST!!!  A little expensive but worth the money!!!!!
4326,4326,4326,4327,5,"For those with gluten allergies, this is great. The shortcakes, biscuits, pancakes taste much the same as with the regular Bisquick. My only problem with it is that it comes in such a small size. Would love for them to box it in larger sizes."
4327,4327,4327,4328,5,This is a healthy alternative to regular Bisquick and works great in any biscuit mix recipe. I will surely buy it again.
4328,4328,4328,4329,4,Was on GF Diet for about 6 months. Used this new product from this old quality company with excellent results. Still use it for variety.<br />A box goes a long way. A little expensive but worth it.
4329,4329,4329,4330,2,"I read lots of good reviews and loved the idea of the convenience of this mix for pancakes and waffles.  So I whipped up some pancakes, breakfast-for-dinner style.  I'm newly diagnosed celiac and thus new to GF, so perhaps I should let a little more time go by on just a diet of naturally gluten free foods before I start trying substitute foods for the wheat foods I used to love, but I swear I cried a little bit when I ate these pancakes.  Because I thought they sucked, frankly.  They are completely bland and have no flavor at ALL, and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste. (I don't know if that's gluten free but if so it's probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it!) After letting the batter stand 10 minutes to thicken up a bit, it was more like kindergarten paste, but still totally flavorless.  My 2 year old daughter gobbled them up, so that's something.  Then I cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that I guess I'll never get to teach her how to make a real, delicious fluffy wheat pancake, but that's a whole other thing.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars just because it is useful for breading oven baked chicken, but you could do that more economically with another GF flour."
4330,4330,4330,4331,5,this is a great product. Perfect for the celiac searching for biscuit mix or pancake mix that actually tastes good.  Also great topping for chicken pot pie.
4331,4331,4331,4332,5,"This product is BEYOND AMAZING! I have been cooking pancakes in assorted ways for four decades. And, for home use, no other product comes close to this Bisquick Gluten Free Mix. It is superior not only to every gluten-free product on the matter; it is ALSO superior to every other mix (gluten-free or not) on the market. Friends and family are constantly amazed and surprised when I serve them breakfast. So, to everyone and anyone, don't make the mistake of associating this Bisquick product w/ other gluten-free products that result in food that tastes like cardboard.<br />Last thought: Thanks to Amazon for making it available as a subscription purchase, since I can no longer find it in any South Florida supermarkets."
4332,4332,4332,4333,5,This stuff makes great pancakes and shortcake that I am actually allowed to eat!<br />My doctor tells me I'm celiac- this was three years ago now. I just hope I can continue to find this Bisquick!
4333,4333,4333,4334,2,"The pricing is quite a bit higher than in the grocery stores.  It is not available in all stores, but I have found it conveniently enough for my purposes."
4334,4334,4334,4335,5,These are really good. I like to make them with a little extra milk so that they are thin. I can't even tell the difference between this and regular pancakes. It's worth the price for my family.
4335,4335,4335,4336,5,"We've been using Pamela's for making pancakes and waffles, but I saw Bisquick and grabbed a box to try it.  It made the absolute BEST waffles we'd ever had - gluten free or not!  Pamela's has you separate the egg yolk from the egg white and made making our Saturday morning waffles tedious.  I added two packets of Splenda to Bisquick's batter and everyone (including my super-picky kid) came back for seconds.  I was a little worried because the batter seemed a bit gritty, but they baked up very smooth and fluffy.  My husband made fried chicken from the mix as well.  We didn't have any left overs of that, either.<br /><br />Way to go, Bisquick!"
4336,4336,4336,4337,2,I am giving this two stars as my family didnt mind the taste but the texture was so grainy and the biscuts fell apart easily. I was not a fan of the pancakes at all I believe they really didnt have a good flavor. Will not be wasting my money on such a tiny package either when you can but a bigger package of regular mix for less? Not fair to us with allergies in my opinion!!
4337,4337,4337,4338,4,"I love that it is mainstream and that it works like bisquick. Not all recipes work the same as regular bisquick though.. so I wish they had more recipes available. It does taste more ""gluten free"" than some other options out there."
4338,4338,4338,4339,5,1 cup gf Bisquick<br />1 cup soy or almond milk<br />3/4 cup sugar<br />cinnamon to taste<br /><br />Pour over your favorite fruit and bake for for a quick delicious cobbler.<br /><br />Gluten-free Bisquick isn't quite as fluffy and crumbly as the original but it is definitely worth it for the GF crowd.
4339,4339,4339,4340,5,"Love these! Pancakes were something I missed the most after going on a gluten-free diet 8 years ago, until now... These are fantastic! :-) Thank you for making them. I love Amazon mom's because i get these shipped monthly. thank you!"
4340,4340,4340,4341,3,"The Bisquick Gluten Free was okay, but inferior to the Bob's Red Mill and Hodgson Mill products. Pancake batter, when made according to directions, was watery, resulting in flat pancakes."
4341,4341,4341,4342,5,"I find the gluten-free Bisquick pancake mix to be just as easy to use as the original Bisquick, and I like the flavor just fine (not much different than regular Bisquick).  It's easy to make the pancakes, just add milk, oil, an egg, mix, and pour on the griddle.  Cooking time seems to be about the same, and the consistency of the pancakes is just like regular pancakes.  I would definitely recommend this mix to anyone needing gluten-free products."
4342,4342,4342,4343,5,I was able to use this Gluten free product and make it taste better than any restaurant by bringing the buttermilk to room temperature and separating the yokes from the whites and adding additional baking powder and baking soda to the recipe. I love it. Served with pure maple syrup brings it out of this world.
4343,4343,4343,4344,5,"My 18 year old son cannot tolerate gluten, so I have been on a quest to find a pancake/biscuit mix for him that he will actually like. I tried a few others and they were horrible. I felt so bad for my son and kept looking. Thank goodness I found Bisquick. It tastes most like real pancake mix and my son really enjoys it. I have made him biscuits too and he is thrilled to eat ""bread"" again.  I highly recommend this mix for anyone who simply cannot eat wheat."
4344,4344,4344,4345,5,"I have been on GF diet for a month and it's hard to find food that taste good or even close to what I used to eat. But when my husband found Bisquick Gluten Free at the store, the issue of what to eat for breakfast never came up. Actually my husband eats the GF pancakes wnow even if he doesn't need a gluten free diet. The pancakes are lighter and very tasty. Just follow the box directions."
4345,4345,4345,4346,5,This product is a MUST HAVE for Celiacs!  The garlic biscuits and pizza crusts you can make are amazing!!
4346,4346,4346,4347,5,Product has similar taste of wheat pancakes without the gluten.  Even other family members not on gluten-free diet like it.
4347,4347,4347,4348,4,Made really great biscuits; even my non-GF husband enjoyed them!  My only complaint would be that the packages aren't very big; I used 2 cups to make a batch of biscuits and I don't think there's even 1 cup left in the package.
4348,4348,4348,4349,5,"After finding out I had a sensitivity to wheat, I searched for alternatives. I decided to try this mix and make some biscuits. Wow, were they good! They sort of reminded me of challah with a slight eggy flavor. They came out more like sandwich rolls (rather than flaky biscuits) but not quite as big. I'm thinking of making them super size next time so I can slice them in half and use for my lunches. After eating corn tortillas every day, I'm glad I found something else I can have. I also made an oven pancake with the mix and that was very good too. I highly recommend it."
4349,4349,4349,4350,5,I tried this today with a recipe from my Bisquik cookbook for a chocolate chip cookie recipe. They came out great! My son who has Autism and food sensory issues came back for seconds. My 16 year old daughter stated they tasted like regular cookies. The recipe was easy but took my whole box of mix. They stayed puffy as I like my cookies that way anyway. I experimented with one tray and refrigerated it. It did not matter other than taking another couple minutes of baking. Will definitely buy this mix again.
4350,4350,4350,4351,5,"Nothing gritty and second rate here!  They are just as good and the only pancake mix we use for the whole family, gluten free or not! They are that good!!"
4351,4351,4351,4352,5,I've never made gluten free items before and I got great reviews from customers for my gluten free coffee cake.
4352,4352,4352,4353,5,"So being Gluten Free is hard, especially in a dorm. But I have gotten really good at making Gluten free pancakes on an electric frying pan. They are super yummy! I also make these really yummy cheesy garlic biscuits. This stuff is heaven sent! Makes food that is reminiscent of ""normal food"""
4353,4353,4353,4354,5,"I LOVE this product! After ten years of doing without, the pancakes and waffles from this product are fantastic! I, too, wish it was packaged in a larger box, but as it is, I don't mind devoting more shelf space to several boxes."
4354,4354,4354,4355,5,"We have been living gluten-free for 5 years now, and this mix is the best I have found!  It makes great waffles."
4355,4355,4355,4356,5,"IT IS HARD FINDING SIMILAR PRODUCTS FOR OUR GLUTEN FREE CHILD, FOR THINGS SHE LOVED BEFORE BEING DIAGNOSED WITH CELIAC DISEASE.  THIS IS A MIX THAT SHE LOVES FOR PANCAKES.  SHE EVEN MADE SWEET POTATO BISCUITS YESTERDAY WITH IT. WE HAVE FOUND IT ON SALE FOR $1.79 PER BOX AT OUR LOCAL GROCERY STORE (LESS THAN AMAZON A FEW TIMES,) SO WE STOCK UP WHEN IT IS ON SALE.  IT WILL BE NICE WHEN GLUTEN FREE FOODS ARE PRICED MORE CLOSELY TO THE WHEAT MIXES.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR YOU.  WE WILL TRY MANY MORE RECIPIES USING THIS PRODUCT IN THE FUTURE.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004391DK0"">Bisquick Pancake and Baking Mix, Gluten-Free, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>"
4356,4356,4356,4357,5,My daughter that is 16 and allergic to Wheat refuses to follow the diet. Until I bought this. Now I make her Waffles and freeze them every few days. I usually get 7-8 waffles out of a box. They are excellent.
4357,4357,4357,4358,3,"Alittle bit expensive for the product I think that it should be the same price as the non gluten Bisquick, and otherwise it's good."
4358,4358,4358,4359,5,"We use gluten free bisquick for many different things - biscuits, pancakes, etc.  Tastes good & lets us serve our kids that are gluten free the same thing as the whole family."
4359,4359,4359,4360,5,I just recently bought Gluten Free Bisquick for the first time.  It has been wonderful.  I have to admit that I am addicted to their pancakes. They are so light and thick and fluffy (unlike homemade gluten free pancakes).  They are absolutely delicious!
4360,4360,4360,4361,4,This product made wonderful pancakes -- I couldn't taste the difference between this Gluten-Free version and the original. I tried using it to make pizza dough to relative success. The texture was a little bit weird but it tasted good!
4361,4361,4361,4362,5,"I was happily surprised with this product. I read other negative reviews and was honestly disappointed in Betty Crocker gf cake mix so I didn't feel the need to try this. I finally bought it at a whim when I saw it at my local market and I am happy I did. I am a baker at heart and love to spoil my family with homemade deserts and pancakes on the weekends. I have adjusted my cooking and baking to primarily gf for the past year now and am happy when I find a gf alternative that cooks & tastes like ""the real thing"". Another plus is that I can buy this at my local market (which does not carry too many specialty foods) and don't have to make the extra trip to the higher end store.<br /><br />I made pancakes today and they were a hit with everyone. Will definitely use it to try other recipes.<br />Only downside is the cost and size of box; very pricey and very small."
4362,4362,4362,4363,4,"This mix made tasty, crispy waffles using a standard waffle iron, but the whole box only made 3.5 waffles.  This would be a five star product for me if I could get more than one family meal out of it for the price."
4363,4363,4363,4364,5,"I've been gluten free for 12 years now, have tried many bread mixes, and I love this one.  So does my husband, who is not gluten free.  I hope that everyone supports these Bisquick products, since big brand gluten-free bread and pasta products are so rare, and so rarely good.  It was something special for me when these came out (if you can imagine waiting a decade for this, you'll understand).  If those of us with celiac disease/gluten-intolerance keep enjoying them, maybe the price will come down (though it's not bad now) and they will offer bulk deals.  It will also wake up other manufacturers.  I would happily order a case or much larger package.  I can make my own bread, but I prefer to use a mix, and use my cooking time for main dishes.  So don't hesitate to try it, I can't imagine being disappointed by this product.  However, I do find it for less at my local grocery store."
4364,4364,4364,4365,5,Extremely happy with Bisquick gluten free!  I had no idea what to expect and was very pleasantly surprised.  I always preferred Bisquick pancakes over other popular brands through the years.  I am happy to say that I can eat my favorite brand of pancakes again without any health repercussions (gluten intolerant).  My next objective is to make the roll recipe on  the box.  I wish all manufacturers would take note of the rising gluten problem in this country!
4365,4365,4365,4366,5,This mix makes the most delicious pancakes! My gluten eating family wanted mine instead of theirs! I have Also make sausage balls and biscuits for biscuits and gravy with it! So Good!
4366,4366,4366,4367,5,"I was amazed to find this on the shelf of my favorite grocer (sorry to say, cheaper than it is sold here, even with subscribe and save....).  First thing I made was my childhood favorite - dumplings - and they were just like I remembered them to be!  The whole family was happy with them - they were such a big hit!  I can't wait to make blueberry muffins this summer.  I have never been able to duplicate the taste of Bisquick with any other gf recipe, and no other recipe for blueberry muffins is quite the same, in my opinion.<br /><br />Thank you, General Mills!"
4367,4367,4367,4368,5,"Like the title says, I have tried (nearly) all the brands, spent a lot of money, and in the end these are the best Gluten Free Pancakes I've had.<br /><br />I am not happy about the lack of fiber, and the the starchy flours used. But a handful of ground flax seed makes up for that.<br /><br />I am also happy about a brand that helps you to make biscuits and other things from the same mix. Other companies sell biscuits and pizza dough as a separate item, duping the customer to spend even more money.<br /><br />Compared to the many other brands, these do not have a ""funny"" taste or smell from odd flours. These are made mostly from Rice and Potato flours. You just feel NORMAL.<br /><br />I hope they will come out with a ""whole grain"" version from Brown Rice and Bean flour.<br /><br />TIP: To get the fluffiest texture use BUTTER instead of oil. Room temperature butter."
4368,4368,4368,4369,5,"I am a Bisquick biscuit lover from way back, and I thought the biscuits made per the recipe were a little blah, but I think they would be perfect using butter or margarine in place of shortening, so I have hope. As far as the cobbler goes, I made a triple berry using the shortcake recipe on the back (which calls for butter rather than shortening) as the crust. It was amazing.<br />If you are expecting the ease of regular bisquick, forget it. This is not a ""just add milk and stir"" kind of product. The biscuits require the addition of egg, shortening (cutting it in, but it is easy and not too messy to mix with your fingers), and milk. Also wish there was more in the box. Most of the recipes on the back require the use of the whole box."
4369,4369,4369,4370,5,"I was so excited to see gluten-free Bisquick. My grandmother and mother both used it. I fondly remember their strawberry shortcake, so that was the first thing I made. I almost cried, it was so good. I have since made the pancakes (yum yum) and baked chicken. I'm a regular at their web site, liveglutenfreely.com for its great recipes. Thank you, Bisquick!"
4370,4370,4370,4371,4,"I like this product, and will order it online again since it is a much better price than the grocery store.  I wish the box was a bit bigger, but it will do.  It is plain, but it makes a light and fluffy pancake.  You can add flavor with vanilla extract, cinamon, or blueberries.  I liked the texture of the biscuit recipe, but it came out more like a muffin.  I'm going to make it in a muffin pan next time and put cranberries in it.  I made my biscuits with butter.  If you are creative with the use of add ins, I think it would make good quickbreads, but not the rising type."
4371,4371,4371,4372,5,"My son just started the Gluten Free diet and I have tried some foods out there just seeing what he will eat. He loved it, I couldn't believe it at first but he kept eating. I'm really glad that I was able to find something that he loves to eat for breakfast. My little girl has starring to eat it to and she says it taste good. I buy it every time I run out cause I love eating it too."
4372,4372,4372,4373,5,"I have always trusted the Bisquick name, so I decided to buy this product.  I was thrilled with the pancakes and muffins I was able to make.  The only thing I have a problem with is the size of the box.  It's very small.  Like most GF product, you pay much more than you would for the non-GF counterpart. :("
4373,4373,4373,4374,5,"Thank goodness Bisquick finally went Gluten -Free!  I have been 3 years diagnosed with Celiac, and besides pillsbury rolls, pancakes have been few and far between as have good biscuits!  We have eaten many pancakes since this product came out.  Way to go Betty Crocker!  Only negative is that this is actually cheaper in my local stores."
4374,4374,4374,4375,5,"My wife and daughter are Celiac but my son and I are not. We have been using Bob's Red Mill GF pancake mix and it's pretty good but you can tell it's gluten free. The pancakes we made today with this Bisquick mix were amazing. My mother, my son, and I could barely tell them from the normal wheat version on flavor. The texture is a bit different but they're light and fluffy unlike a lot of overly dense GF versions. We'll definitely be stocking up on this and using it with some of the old stand-by regular Bisquick recipes to see how it works in them."
4375,4375,4375,4376,5,"This is a great product! Hats off to Betty Crocker once again. They are becoming a more ""MAIN STREAM"" go-to company for people who are gluten free!"
4376,4376,4376,4377,5,"So far, I've only had time to make waffles with this new GF Bisquick, but they were delicious. Sometimes with gluten free products, you have to use other weird ingredients, or processes to make them. These waffles were super fast, easy, and seriously delicious. Can't wait to make other things!"
4377,4377,4377,4378,1,"Going gluten free is not optional for those diagnosed with celiac disease---- but eating a pizza made with a dough created with this product is optional---and definitely not recommended. I knew something was amiss when I opened the product and it was the consistency of very fine white beach sand. Putting my reservations aside, I proceeded to make pizza dough as directed on the box. Needless to say, the pizza dough was chewy and tasted very strange. I would not recommmend this product for pizza dough."
4378,4378,4378,4379,4,The product is very good. Way too expensive and at almost 5.00 a box to get pancakes or biscuits I was disappointed
4379,4379,4379,4380,4,"My family is gluten intolerant and we use this product extensively.  Pancakes, biscuits, waffles, it doesn't really matter what you need to bake, this mix comes through.  This is my go to mix above Bob's and all others we have tried.  Try a box, follow the instructions for pancakes, and tell me they aren't awesome... go ahead... I dare you."
4380,4380,4380,4381,1,Bisquick GF is easy to use. Pancakes and muffins are very<br />tasty. The product is quick and easy to use. It makes my day.  Gram
4381,4381,4381,4382,5,"I have tried numerous boxed gluten free flours, and I never get the consistent results I get from Bisquick's GF Mix. It's also more economical than making your own (who wants to buy 5+ flours just to make a cake??). And this one never has that strange metallic smell others like Bob's have. I find myself making pancakes, biscuits, cupcakes again after years of going bread free due to a wheat allergy.<br /><br />My one complaint is that I can't seem to find this in any local store; I have my fingers crossed that Amazon continues to carry this!"
4382,4382,4382,4383,5,I have purchased San Francisco Bay coffee before. I have always found that the quality of their coffee is excellent. The beans are always well chosen and slow roasted. A very high quality coffee at a reasonable price.
4383,4383,4383,4384,4,The coffee was good but didn't have a strong flavor. Wouldn't buy this product again. Nice to try new products and try new flavors.
4384,4384,4384,4385,5,I had tried a small batch of the pods for my Keurig and fell in love....this Fog Chaser variety is just about perfect.  I shall be ordering more beans so I never run out.
4385,4385,4385,4386,3,"My parents fell in love with 'San Francisco Bay Coffee Company' coffee, which use to be available at our local AZ Costco. For christmas I looked every where for this coffee & found what I thought was a great value on Amazon. When I bought it (12/21/11) there was ""No Image Available"", should have been my first warning sign. They had lots of pictures of the 12oz bags of coffee from the San Francisco Bay Coffee Co, but I wanted something bigger, and this was 2 lbs. Now there is a picture availble, but if you look closely it's ""Roger's Family Company"" coffee, who is technically located near the San Francisco Bay Area. So if you're in love with San Francisco Bay Coffee Company, don't buy this coffee. But on the upside, since I waited till the last minute to buy it, I gave it to my parents for christmas anyway & explained what happened, but they said the coffee was pretty decent. So still makes a nice cup of coffee, just not San Francisco Bay Coffee Company coffee."
4386,4386,4386,4387,1,These sticks definitely don't look like ones in the picture.<br />They are much thinner and IMHO not worth the money. I should have returned it but instead gave my dog (GSD) 5 at a time to keep her busy.<br /><br />I'd stick with the Redbarn or equivalent from another website.
4387,4387,4387,4388,1,"I just received my order of 100 count regular bully sticks and am extremely disappointed.<br />""Only ValuePetSupplies bulk Bully Sticks are hand measured for consistent thickness"". I beg to differ.<br />The ""regular"" size is quoted as 9/16"" thickness. The product I received is less than 4/16"" in thickness.<br />Out of 100 pieces, less than five actually measured up to the regular thickness advertised.<br />My blue heeler dispatched one piece in less than a minute. It usually takes him five minutes.<br /><br />On the other hand, my toy fox terrier is still working on hers and won't leave leftovers for the big guy to clean up.<br />While I understand that ValuePetSupplies.com sponsors good causes, I will be spending an extra 15 cents per piece and get a much more substantial treat."
4388,4388,4388,4389,5,Oue two labs love these and they are soooo expensive in the pet stores ($4.50) each. We got these in bulk for under a dollar each.
4389,4389,4389,4390,3,"I have two medium-sized dogs, and these are a real bargain, but only keep them busy for about 15 minutes. Next time I will get the larger size."
4390,4390,4390,4391,2,"I ordered these despite my concerns after reading other reviews re: small diameter size.  Absolutely true, and I regret making the purchase. For the same price, I briefly ordered from a different Amazon vendor the same # and length bully sticks for the same price.  Difference?  Original vendor bully sticks were on average 3/4"" thick.  This vendor bully sticks are at MOST 1/2"" thick, with most closer to 1/4"".<br /><br />What difference does it make?<br /><br />Our dog, a slender 44 lb. mixed boxer/chow, would take 3-5 days to get through a 3/4"" bully stick, and would get hours and hours of good gnawing time in on each one.  These new thin ones she completely consumes in less than 30 mins.  That makes a huge difference in how fast we go through the bag!<br /><br />Will not order again from this supplier."
4391,4391,4391,4392,4,"The thickness is just as described. They are not thin as straws like some other reviews had stated. My 2 pet chihuahuas love them very much. It usually takes them an hour or so to finish chewing so it's a great time passer for them. One negative thing I'd complain is the strong smell of the bag, though. I have to tuck it away in a corner in order not to smell it often when pass by. This might not apply to everyone, since my nose is a bit more sensitive than most normal people. Over all, I'd had given 5 star if it wasn't for the smell, I have to give 4 stars for now."
4392,4392,4392,4393,1,"Apparently 'regular' size = thinner than standard-sized pencils =(  My chihuahuas finish these in a matter of minutes, when it normally takes them days to consume a thicker bully stick."
4393,4393,4393,4394,5,"Great on any thing from rice to pasta to burgers.  I cant wait until the week end for my favorite over easy eggs, hash browns, and this mix.  More heat than you would expect, have tried a couple other brands, not the same...."
4394,4394,4394,4395,5,"With all natural ingredients and no preservatives; all I can say is ""fantastic"".  There is no expiration date but I would eat this within a week or two -- faster if it's opened.  Absolutely excellent!<br /><br />You can freeze these with no loss of quality.<br /><br />Don't order if the weather is hot because they ship it in cool bags with cold packs instead of styrofoam with dry ice.  My orders usually arrive cool but not cold."
4395,4395,4395,4396,1,"The ghastly horror of these pickles is enough to strip the mind of reason.  They are brown, mushy, and flavored with spices that bring to mind the morgue and the taxidermist.  On top of that each and every pickled chunk is sweetened with a full tablespoon of pure cane sugar.<br /><br />No living human being could consume more than one without selling his immortal soul."
4396,4396,4396,4397,4,"in my opinion these are heads and twos above any pickle that you normally find at your local grocery store.  a lot of nice, sweet, pickle flavor.  I probably won't buy again off of amazon because of shipping charges, but if i ever see them locally, i'll buy a bunch."
4397,4397,4397,4398,5,I gave this as a stocking stuffer to my husband to remind him of our last holiday in beautiful Jamaica.  It has a truly tropical taste that is very unique and yummy.
4398,4398,4398,4399,5,"Best grapefruit soda on the market!! Cost is good, but shipping is expensive. I still buy it every now and then for a special occasion!"
4399,4399,4399,4400,4,I was looking for holiday sprinkles in bulk and lucked up to find these.  I have purchased this brand at Williams and Sonoma before but always in small containers.  I paid the same amount here for the bulk package.  I am very happy.
4400,4400,4400,4401,5,"What a steal!  I make a lot of Gingerbread Cookies during the holidays - large ones - over 6"" long - and I bag them in florist corsage bags.  They look like you bought them at a fancy store.  These decorations are the best and they are so cheap."
4401,4401,4401,4402,5,India Tree products are great and you cannot beat the value here at Amazon.I use these to decorate cakes and cupcakes.  They will get a workout as the holidays near.
4402,4402,4402,4403,1,"I have used this mix for years for yellow pound cake and everyone seems to love it.  I'm still able to purchase the 18oz. at my local grocery.  I was going to order this product, but saw that it was 16.5 oz. and was afraid it wouldn't go with the old Duncan Hines pound cake recipe.  Hope these companies realize the damage they are doing to time proven recipes when they downsize their products."
4403,4403,4403,4404,1,"In the past I was able to make so many different cakes using this cake mix. I made 2 rum cakes today thinking I had done something wrong when the first one didn't turn out as usual. I now realize I didn't do anything wrong,Duncan Hines did something wrong by reducing the size of their product; I would gladly have paid more for the larger mix. Now I will never buy another Dunkin Hines Mix!!!!! How dumb do you think we are."
4404,4404,4404,4405,1,"Duncan Hines used to be my favorite line of cake mixes. I bought them all of the time. But now they, like Betty Crocker, have downsized their packages of cake mix. These new mixes will not work with older recipes, that called for the 18.25 ounce size of cake mix. That rules out a lot of our favorite cakes. Even a plain cake will be changed - it won't bake up as high or as big in the pan. Duncan Hines just lost me as a customer.<br /><br />Pillsbury has not reduced their cake mix sizes (at least, not yet). I will be buying them. If they shrink in size, I will bake from scratch."
4405,4405,4405,4406,1,"While I think this product is good, I'm disappointed that they reduced the weight of the product from 18.25 oz to 16.25 oz. Has anyone else noticed how difficult it is to read the type used for the weight, the 6 looks very much like an 8.  Same size box, less product, hmmmm."
4406,4406,4406,4407,2,"I have bought Duncan Hines Yellow cake mix in the past and have made a favorite recipe with it.  In the past, it had 18.25 ounces.  Pillsbury and Betty Crocker have the required ounces 18+.  I bought Duncan Hines at Safeway because it was less expensive than the other brands and after I got home, I discovered why.  I will not buy Duncan Hines again unless they go back to the 18+ ounces or go to 9 ounces for $.54.  Consumer beware and read the number of ounces in the product."
4407,4407,4407,4408,5,"It must be true because it says so on the package: ""America's Favorite Cake.""<br /><br />I seem to remember a check box on the 2010 Census regarding cake preference, but I don't think I voted for Yellow Cake. I would have voted for Devil's Food Cake, although it may be politically incorrect these days to mention, you know, The Devil, so I may have voted for German Chocolate Cake, but Germany is, you know, the Old Europe, so I  may have voted for a chocolate cupcake. But without peanuts because so many people are now allergic to peanuts that they can't even serve 0.5 grams of salted nuts on airplanes. Sigh.<br /><br />Where was I? Hmmm? Oh, yes....<br /><br />I certainly would vote for Duncan Hines cake but I feel it should be mentioned that this is not cake.....yet. This is cake mix.<br /><br />Its sort of a cake fetus, or a cake stem cell. It still needs lots of development. You have to add additional ingredients and warmth and time to develop the mix into a cake. There is the promise of cake, but unless you follow the protocol written on the box very carefully, you may not get cake. Depending on what you do, you may get something very odd and rubbery or something very dark and charred.<br /><br />It's complicated!<br /><br />Amazon has allowed third-party vendors to offer Duncan Hines Cake Mixes for sale for quite some time. An example of this is: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IMS5K"">Duncan Hines Classic Yellow Layer Cake Mix 18.25 oz - 6 Unit Pack</a>. Amazon, being a very clever retailer, has obviously read the numerous, highly enthusiastic customer reviews for this product, and has now started selling these products directly to its customers, so many of whom must be begging for a six pack of a product readily available in any supermarket or convenience store.<br /><br />In order to enhance customer demand, Amazon's copywriters have outdone themselves listing this product's outstanding features:<br /><br />-Pack of six, 16.5 18.25 ounces each (now 1.75 oz. lighter!)<br />-The moistest, most delicious<br />-A special treat for the special people<br /><br />Of course, ""the special people"" must be those who voted for Duncan Hines Yellow Cake Mix. That's why it's ""America's Favorite Cake"". Makes perfect sense. This is a Democracy! This is a great country and this is great cake mix!<br /><br />Another thing you should know is that you get six boxes of cake mix. This is enough mix to incubate a very, very big sheet cake that would require a very, very large incubator or oven. You could also prepare a tall 12 layer cake which would kind of look like a miniature version of the Coit Tower in San Francisco. Certainly enough ""the moistest, most delicious"" yellow cake for a very large number of ""the special people"".<br /><br />Finally, a charming aspect is that on the very same page as this product, Amazon suggests ""Customers Who Bought This Product Also Bought"": Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipes, Refills, Case of 4 / 84s (336 ct). Obviously, ""the special people"" anticipate getting down with this cake. Six boxes of cake mix is bound to make a mess in the kitchen and later on, there will be cake crumbs on lips and chins and fingers.<br /><br />A few Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipes could come in handy!<br /><br />Smart!"
4408,4408,4408,4409,1,"Maybe, I got a bad one.  It's very plain, nothing special in flavor.  I felt like I wasted my time and money. I will not buy this flavor again."
4409,4409,4409,4410,4,thanks for having it sent to me promptly. i was very happy to be able to order it online and get it the next couple days.
4410,4410,4410,4411,2,"I made one for my daughter's birthday party and everyone but her died of uranium poisoning. Still tasted pretty good, though."
4411,4411,4411,4412,4,"Ghirardelli isn't the finest chocolate you can buy, but it's pretty good, and the Intense Dark Assortment is both inexpensive, and provides you a few possibilities.<br /><br />I've lately taken to unwrapping a 60%, 72% and 86% cacao square for each dinner guest and setting them on an individual saucer, to serve as an after-dinner sampler with red wine or Scotch. That's been a pretty popular approach. A similar approach also works ""therapeutically""---if someone's having a bad day, sitting them down with a small assortment of increasingly intense chocolate isn't a bad path to feeling a little better.<br /><br />I do wish that there were the same number of each in the bag; that's the only downside. Of course, if you really want the sets of three to serve to guests, you'll have to go through the tiresome task of somehow eating the extras. Darn."
4412,4412,4412,4413,5,"Many reports are coming out about how chocolate is actually good for you, so eat more!  This is the perfect chocolate to do that with.  The varying levels of cocoa are perfect to help adjust your taste buds to eating dark, dark chocolate. It's not an easy transition for a milk/semi-sweet kinda gal, but this chocolate is affordable and so tasty.  I also like that I can just have one (as they are individually wrapped), and choose my %."
4413,4413,4413,4414,5,"I love this sampler of Ghiradelli Chocolate Intense Dark Squares especially now that nutritionists recommend you have an oz. of dark chocolate each day that is over 70% cacoa.  Chocolate is a vegetable a friend reminded--it's a bean!<br /><br />These chocolates are affordable, tasty, rich, intense, silky smooth and just the right size.  I love to serve them for after dinner.  The squares are fairly large and individually wrapped.  It's great to have different amounts of cacoa depending on guests' tastes.  Dark chocolate is an acquired taste for some.  Of course, the darker the chocolate, the healthier so you can work your way up to the 86% cacoa. Great to have on hand for the holidays.  If you are on a diet and want a low calorie chocolate healthy treat, having these individually wrapped dilutes the temptation.  I'm happy with one square most days.<br /><br />These are a great non-guilty pleasure that are good for your health!"
4414,4414,4414,4415,5,"I got this for a family member as part of a football themed gift. I like that the basket can be reused. I have had the pasta before, so I know it is good. I don't know how the other items taste."
4415,4415,4415,4416,5,"36 of these candy bars just might seem like overkill, but you can always tell yourself that you're going to give them out to company! Of course, the truth is that they are way too good to give away to anybody -- they can just go get their own.<br /><br />The good news is that they are shipped so fresh and soft that they will last 'till you can finish off your stash!<br /><br />They're awesome!"
4416,4416,4416,4417,5,"This product is shipped so fresh that even if it takes your family months to eat their way through the box, the last 'Bit-O-Honey' will still be fresher than anything you can buy off the shelf at your local grocer.  These are the large candy-bar sized, wrapped in wax paper.  Because they are fresh, they are soft like taffy and so a breeze to extract from the wax paper, plus have the fullest flavor ever.  Enjoy!!"
4417,4417,4417,4418,5,"They're almost gone already, and I'm about 5 pounds heavier, but these candy bars are much fresher than anything in the stores--if and when you can find an outlet that carries them! Yum!"
4418,4418,4418,4419,5,"The Bit o' honey candy that I ordered took me back to my childhood when I used to buy the product.  It arrived in a timely manner, in good shape, and of course it tasted delicous."
4419,4419,4419,4420,5,"EXCELLENT QUALITY AND SO O O FRESH.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5AO8O"">Bit O' Honey Candy, 1.7-Ounce Packets (Pack of 36)</a>"
4420,4420,4420,4421,5,I was glad I ordered this candy. It still taste like it did 20 years ago.
4421,4421,4421,4422,5,"I was just going to reorder the ""Bit-O-Honey""  Last me a long time and I enjoy eating it slowly in my mouth... Just like a kid!"
4422,4422,4422,4423,5,"love my Taffy<br />She's so laffy<br />Her name is Bit O' Honey<br />She gives me a kiss<br />Oh what, ""A Bliss"""
4423,4423,4423,4424,3,I found the candy to be harder than I had expected.  It came in bar form and it is rather hard to chew but just as tasty--just takes more chewing to enjoy!!
4424,4424,4424,4425,5,My neighbor and I love this candy and it's difficult to find the 1.7 oz. packets in the stores.  So I just decided to purchase a whole case.  They were fresh and great tasting.
4425,4425,4425,4426,5,"Best Bit-O-Honey I have ever eaten.<br />I have always bought this product at a local grocery store and it was always hard, I figured it was suppose to be that way. But after eating the box I bought here I now know better; the candy was soft and delicious.<br />I plan to continue buying Bit-O-Honey from here."
4426,4426,4426,4427,4,"This is an excellent candy for those of us who have to limit our chocolate intake.  Each bar is sectioned into six pieces, which helps with portion control--and makes it perfect for sharing!  My only quibble is that it's sometimes hard to get all the waxed paper off the candy, as it's quite sticky."
4427,4427,4427,4428,5,"Haven't had Bit O Honey since I was a kid ... and seeing them on Amazon made the purchase a ""no-brainer.""  And they were as good as I remember."
4428,4428,4428,4429,5,"I hate honey but I love Bit O Honey candy. I really don't taste the honey in them. I like the bars better than the individually wrapped candies because the shape is easier to eat. I like them hard, brittle and chewy, not soft. This is actually cheaper per bar than where I buy them locally."
4429,4429,4429,4430,4,This was my second order of Bit O Honey.<br />The first one arived with the celophane cut and one item missing.<br />I hope Mr. Sticky Fingers found the candy as enjoyable as I did.
4430,4430,4430,4431,3,"While I love Bit a Honey and don't regret my purchase, I did not find them as ""fresh and soft"" as the other reviewers. They arrived hard and brittle but still taste wonderful if you can eat them without breaking your teeth. Maybe it's because I bought the bags of individually wrapped Bit a Honey's as opposed to the actual candy bars. Next time it's the bars!"
4431,4431,4431,4432,5,"Dried berries, still with texture and the quintessential aroma. Pot roast is so much better with half a dozen berries flattened into the breadboard and scooped into the pickling mixture. But in ten years, trying to find them - gee. So now I know to look for it on Amazon."
4432,4432,4432,4433,5,"Again, exactly what I ordered. No fuss, no muss. Arrived on time. Pretty much an ideal transaction. Only thing that threw me was that I underestimated the quantity. (gallon baggie in the freezer, ftw)"
4433,4433,4433,4434,3,"Berries are find, but the package is bad. Unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your berries are all over the floor."

These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians."""
4435,4435,4435,4436,1,Be advised. You will only receive 1 (one) box. They are less than $3.00 in the local grocery store. Will not purchase again.
4436,4436,4436,4437,5,"Love these little peanut butter dipped granola bars.  They are delicious.  They are only one point on the Weight Watchers POINTS system.  Even you were not dieting, these bars are a great and filling snack."
4437,4437,4437,4438,5,"We love them! This is a great 100 calorie snack. I snack on them throughout the day. My husband, and 3 year old enjoys eating them as well."
4438,4438,4438,4439,1,"This product was absolutely horrible!  Each and every bar was obviously old, because it was stale, smelled awful, and had to be thrown out.  Shame one you for even trying to sell such a product!"
4439,4439,4439,4440,5,"I love Pico Pica.  It adds some flavor, and it's not too hot. I eat it at least 2 meals every day. It's good on eggs, it's good on pizza, it's good on vegetables.<br /><br />Really, you can't go wrong."
4440,4440,4440,4441,5,"Thank goodness for MexGrocer. We love this Pico Pica sauce. I cannot find this product in local grocery stores anymore.  Internet shopping makes living in a podunk town bearable. No more long lists saved for the occasional trip to the ""big city"". I am on a first name basis with the UPS and FedEx drivers. USPS shipments are hit and miss, if they fit in the mailbox, great, if not, then it's saddle up and head to town. Pico Pica is our favorite product, it is so good!  Love it!"
4441,4441,4441,4442,5,"This is a very different sauce - nothing like anything you'll find in the grocery store. It's closer to the ""botique"" salsas that have recently appeared with the new ""taco restaurant"" trend. It's a little smokey. My picky 3-year old will eat a burrito with this on it. My family always had this (mild) on the table in Southern California and now that I've been transplanted in South Florida I am happy to mail-order. You can get the little single-serve pouches directly from the company, too."
4442,4442,4442,4443,5,"This company is an American Classic been in business over 90 years. Why? Because it is the best hot sauce and taco sauce bar none. There are some other good brands oout there, but this is the best and nothing compares to it. The Hot sauce has reasonable heat and bite and adds unique flavor to your favorite Mex foods. The taco (Mild) sauce is milder and just perfect on tacos, enchaladas, tostadas, tamales, Bell Beefers, and frozen mex dinners. The harder to find green sauce is to die for. Great on everything! Unfortunately I don't see the green stuff on Amazon but you can find it. Just get it. Try all three. I grew up with this stuff so am very partial to it. I keep about five or six bottles (each variety) on my shelves at all times.

4443,4443,4443,4444,5,"I gave this as a gift and it was a big hit.  Nothing was broken, it was gift wrapped (paid for this), and even came with additional salt samples.  I was surprised at the amount of salt in each tube.  More than enough to get numerous meals of use out of each.  It was well recieved and I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.  I will say I think the shipping cost was a tad high, but the salt was a good deal so it evens out."
4444,4444,4444,4445,5,"I bought this product for a friend, but I liked it so much, I'm keeping it and buying a second one for my friend!"
4445,4445,4445,4446,5,"I ordered this collection on 6/9/10 and it arrived on 6/12. Although it was was very well-packaged, this did not prevent the USPS from managing to break one of the tubes. The seller was contacted by email and a replacement requested. As this was a birthday gift and the occasion was only a week away, I offered to pay for expedited shipping. Seller responded immediately stating that a replacement would be shipped ASAP. The replacement tube arrived three days later in good shape. My offer to pay additional shipping charges was declined. In summary, this product is excellent and the customer service absolutely first rate. I highly recommend both the product and the seller."
4446,4446,4446,4447,5,I ordered this salt collection for my husband as a Christmas gift. He absolutely loves it and has used it every night since. This is a great gift for anyone who enjoys cooking. I will be ordering the second collection for him soon.
4447,4447,4447,4448,5,What a great gift! I bought it for a couple of foodie friends and they LOVED it. It came beautifully packaged ready to gift. I would totally recommend it.
4448,4448,4448,4449,5,"This is such a great product from subtle flavors and aromas for delicate dishes to smokey salts for hearty cooking, this is a great product for the chef who loves flavor and experimenting in the kitchen.  This is such a cool product!!"
4449,4449,4449,4450,5,"Last year I gave this along with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1845979125"">Salt: Cooking with the World's Favorite Seasoning</a> to my foodie friends and family. They all loved it! The salt tubes were well packaged and I ordered 10 sets and had no broken tubes. The package also came with salt samples which I really appreciate. I have Collection Sets 1 and 2 on my counter and get lots of comments about them when people visit."
4450,4450,4450,4451,5,"I purchased the Old World collection directly from the Spice Lab as a Father's Day gift for my husband.  The item was extremely well packed and arrived ahead of schedule. A small wooden salt spoon, sample packets of gourmet salts and a reference/index card with information about each of the 11 salts were included. Brett was responsive and helpful. This is a great company with an interesting variety of salts and spices. I will definitely make a future purchase and refer the Spice Lab to others.<br /><br />UPDATE: I'm disappointed that my email reguarding a broken test tube and cork has gone unanswered.  The first time I used one of the salts, I was extrememly gentle but a large piece broke off as well as some of the cork top. The tubes should not be so fragile so I sent an email to that affect to Brett, the owner. Despite answering my initial email about how much I loved the gift and where could I post a positive comment, he has not responded with regards to the breakage. Good customer service would be to follow up....."
4451,4451,4451,4452,5,"What a wonderful starter kit this is.  While I am and was familiar with some varieties of exotic sea salts, I certainly had not had the opportunity to try this many at one time.  Tather than chance buying a product that I did not like and being stuck with it, this allowed me to give each and everyone a try.<br /><br />I plan to order at least three more sets for presents this coming year for friends that, like me, are foodies.<br /><br />This is an excellent product."
4452,4452,4452,4453,5,this product is great  and so is the company I had problem with the post office and they were right there to resolve the issue this is a great gift to yourself or to others
4453,4453,4453,4454,5,"This is a very neat gift for someone you know that is into cooking and eating.  It has a wide variety of exotic salt represented in the collection.<br /><br />There is a surprising amount of salt in the collection.  In other words, each tube holds about as much salt as would fill a small salt shaker."
4454,4454,4454,4455,4,"Purchased this as a gift for a couple of salt loving friends - It is great and attractive! A note to purchasers: we had one vial of the salt arrive empty and it says no returns, if you contact the seller directly they will work with you. The seller send me a replacement vial (very quickly) and even sent a cool little salt dish along with it.  Will definitely get this set for others (maybe even me) in the future."
4455,4455,4455,4456,5,"On Sept.12 I posted the following seller review:<br />  3/5 stars:<br />  ""I'm sorry to say that this item arrived with some slight cosmetic damage. On the top front edge of the rack there is what I would call a dent, but it's also rough. From the way it was packaged I would have to say that it was that way when it was put into the box. I intended this as a gift, and I don't have time to return it, so I'll just try to sand it down so it's at least smooth.""<br />  Jammies, September 12, 2012<br />Later Amazon added:<br />  Message from Amazon: ""This item was fulfilled by Amazon, and we take responsibility for this fulfillment experience.""<br /><br />Shortly after I posted it, I received an email from The Spice Lab Inc. offering to send a new block. I sent them a couple of pictures of the damaged area. They sent me a new block and two little spoons to replace the one that was missing from my original order. The replacement block arrived yesterday in plenty of time for my trip to visit my son and daughter-in-law.<br /><br />In hindsight, I should have contacted The Spice Lab before I posted the review, so they could have had time to resolve the problem. I had jumped to the conclusion that I'd need to return the item in order to get a replacement, which wasn't the case.<br /><br />Since it's a gift, I can't speak to the quality of the salt, but I can say that the block is very sturdy and attractive, and the little spoon is a charming addition.<br /><br />I greatly appreciate the efforts of Brett at The Spice Lab, and I would happily buy from them again."
4456,4456,4456,4457,5,"I got these salts for my boyfriend who loves to cook and love his salt! The stand they come in is wooden and sturdy, much nicer than I expected! The salts themselves are phenomenal and I have already bought the 2nd set!"
4457,4457,4457,4458,4,"I bought this as a gift for a friend who likes exotic salts, and it was a hit with him. It was well packaged with no breakage. (Some of the reviews have mentioned that they received broken containers.) The wooden holder is nice but not all that permanent. I would recommend this for someone who'd like to sample various kinds of salt and doesn't mind paying a high price. The reason I gave it four and not five stars was the price."
4458,4458,4458,4459,1,"Four of the eleven glass vials arrived broken. The product is apparently not able to be returned, so I just wasted 55 dollars."
4459,4459,4459,4460,1,One of the vials was broken when we received this product... but you can't return the product or get a refund.  What a rip off.
4460,4460,4460,4461,5,THIS TASTE IS BETWEEN SOMETHING LIKE FLAX BREAD AND CORNBREAD..... EXCELLENT TOASTED WITH BUTTER AND JELLY...DID NOT RAISE MY BLOOD SUGAR AT ALL.... I LOVE IT.
4461,4461,4461,4462,5,"I just had a wonderful dinner: Fresh fluke fried in a tempura batter. The batter fried up perfectly lacy and crisp, both delicious and beautiful. AND low-carb; I floured my fish with the LC Foods Pan Bread Flour, and then used the same flour to make a batter with some low-carb beer, salt, and a little smoked paprika. An absolute knockout. You really won't believe it's low carb, but I'm about to test my blood sugar levels, and will report back in 90 minutes."
4462,4462,4462,4463,5,"My friend who lives in Fla. told me about these French twists and was complaining that she couldn't find them here in Middletown, OH.  I ordered 12 boxes to see what she was raving about and found only one problem with them.......I couldn't stop eating them.  I ate 11 boxes of them in just a few days and gave the last one away so I wouldn't eat it too.  If a person can stop after eating 1 or 2 servings, they are a great addition to your diet.  Unfortunately, I couldn't stop!!!!!"
4463,4463,4463,4464,5,"These french twists are delicious.  I am on Weight Watchers and 2 of these twists have a ONE Points Plus value.  All the flavors of these are fantastic.  You can eat cookies and still be healthy.  Please Barry's Bakery, never stop making these!!  The price on these through Amazon cannot be beat.  I have paid from $3 to $4 per box in the supermarkets.  I will be ordering another case soon."
4464,4464,4464,4465,5,Love these snacks...great for a quick fix as well as a snack that doen't add the huge calories or fat that concerns many! Great taste as well as consistency!
4465,4465,4465,4466,5,"I saw these in our local commissary one day and decided I *had* to give them a try.  I was only looking for something that might be a better for me choice to satisfy my sweet tooth.  I had no idea how much I would like these and have to have *more*.  I got one bag of the Raspberry and one bag of the Maple and I love them both!!!  I'm thrilled to see that they are a much healthier alternative than most baked goods, especially than the ones I normally choose.  I am not someone who is health consious or tends to read labels before buying an item.  I love these twists and am looking to buy them in a larger quantity so I can enjoy them more often!  They are light and flaky and satisfying and good...a must for me!"

It is not available in our area.  We discoverd it in the North while visiting friends. It is low cal and good for diabetics who need a sugar fix.  Keep a good supply for future orders."
4467,4467,4467,4468,5,I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BEFORE. THESE SNACKS ARE CRISP AND GREAT TASTING. ALSO LOW IN CALORIES. I RECOMMEND THEM HIGHLY. THEY ARE SHIPPED ALMOST INSTANTLY AND ARRIVE WITHIN A FEW DAYS.
4468,4468,4468,4469,5,These shortbread cookies are delicious.  I bought some while in London this summer.  They are hard to find and expensive in USA.
4469,4469,4469,4470,5,"Everything I bought was great, infact I ordered twice and the third ordered was<br />for my mother and father."
4470,4470,4470,4471,5,I sent two Babkas to a friend as a thank you.  He is a big Seinfeld fan so he was thrilled to get both a cinnamon and chocolate babka.<br /><br />He said the babkas were delicious!!!
4471,4471,4471,4472,5,This is a great product. Great flavors and very fresh. I received it quickly and damage free. It is my opinion that this is a great value and I highly recommend it.
4472,4472,4472,4473,5,"At first, I was concerned about ordering Babka online but I kinda missed this one. As I tasted it the only thing I could say was : ""wow"". I will order this again for sure."
4473,4473,4473,4474,5,wonderfully cinnamon-y! i will definitely be ordering it again! and heated up with a tiny bit of butter on it put it over the top in taste.
4474,4474,4474,4475,5,"Looking forward to receiving this product and when it arrived it was covered in walnuts.  Unfortunately, tree nuts are an issue and I wish that there was information about nuts on the items listing.  I will bring it to work for the staff to enjoy.<br /><br />Addendum:  Staff loved the babka.  Picture of product now shows nuts on top, prior listing did not.  5 stars for the babka and 3 stars for the lack of ingredient list. (At least major allergens)."
4475,4475,4475,4476,2,"While the flavor and quality of this chili is great, the 108-ounce can is mostly liquid. The number of servings is listed as 12, but the reality is that it will only serve about 5, unless you add more of your own ingredients as the first reviewer indicated. I won't be purchasing this again."
4476,4476,4476,4477,5,Love this stuff!  I add some diced tomatoes and a pound of ground hamburger and this is great!  I take it to pot lucks a lot.
4477,4477,4477,4478,5,You can't beat the price and taste of this coffee. It will always be my first choice to buy. My husband brought it home one day because he liked the price and thought the the can looked neat. Little did we know it would become our new favorite.
4478,4478,4478,4479,5,"Can't  go wrong with this.  Remember its jingle:  ""Better coffee a millionaire's money can't  buy!""  Always priced right and in this economy that's  not always easy.  Frankly I prefer it over Starbucks where one can easily spend the same amount on ONE cup of coffee!"
4479,4479,4479,4480,1,B U R N E D<br /><br />I read the other two reviews and didn't heed their warning. That's on me.<br /><br />They are 'usable' but they were certainly burned.
4480,4480,4480,4481,1,I can't believe I wasted almost $20 on this. They were burned! They were inedible! It was so nasty and they took forever to arrive!<br />You should take this product off of your product list. Worst product i've ever ordered
4481,4481,4481,4482,1,I purchased 6 boxes as gifts at $21 per box.  I spent over $120.00 and none could be used.  Every piece was broken and could not be used for the Seder.  Sending a gift that is broken and can't be used is very embarrassing.  Also the return window is April 18th which is ridiculous since the matzo was for the first Seder which was on April 18th at night.
4482,4482,4482,4483,5,"Every Revolution product I have tried has been a wonderful experience.  Revolution knows how to balance the inherit flavors of tea leaves with other ingredients which make each tea unique and enjoyable.<br /><br />Better Than The Rest<br /><br />I've been buying this particular tea consecutively for the better half of a year now, and I simply love it. No other pomegranate tea comes close to this one in terms of quality and taste.  For example, Trader Joe's store brand (while good) seems as if it has been sweetened (to the point where it's too sweet), and surprisingly the tea turns red after less than a minute of seeping indicating that coloring was added (I didn't check the ingredients, so I may be wrong about this).  There's also Yogi's pomegranate tea which uses a green tea and creates an entirely different taste. I liked it; didn't love it.<br /><br />Complimenting Flavors<br /><br />Pomegranates are often compared to apples.  In fact, pomegranate means ""seeded apple"" (from latin: pomum - apple and granatus - seeded), and like an apple the fruit is sweet and tart, but has a very strong and distinct flavor.  Thus, a light white tea is the perfect companion; it doesn't overpower the pomegranate flavor but allows it to mingle on the tongue.  Likewise, the amount of pomegranate, or rather the intensity of the pomegranate flavor, is truly perfect.  No flavor overpowers the other, but rather all the flavors compliment one another.<br /><br />Brewing<br /><br />I'm sure someone out there will say that I'm butchering tea when I brew this, but when I do, I leave the tea bag in the mug until I've consumed it all.  I find that the taste never gets too strong and never gets bitter.  Typically this is only the case for herbal teas, which don't become overpowered since they contain no tea leaves.  In this case the same is true, perhaps because it is a white tea which is naturally light. The tea itself literally contains dried pomegranate seeds (flesh included).  Do you know that taste you get a few moments after you eat a pomegranate seed? (If you don't, try it! It's wonderful.)  That initial bite from the tartness followed by sweetness you get (or at least I get) from a pomegranate is captured in this tea, and it makes sense! There's pomegranate seeds in there!<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Buy this tea!  I was a little skeptical about my first purchase since I was buying 6 boxes, but it was a great choice that I do not in the least bit regret.  I've bought this for myself and for family, with everyone absolutely loving it. Best $20 I have ever spent (and continue to spend)!"
4483,4483,4483,4484,5,Enjoyable tea with a refreshing taste.  The 16-count Pack of 6 represents an excellent buy compared to store prices.
4484,4484,4484,4485,5,I love this tea.  I have issues with added flowers and flavorings in other teas and Revolution teas tell you exactly whats in it and there are no additives!  I have been ordering from them ever since my first box of tea.  I take it to the office and I have a travel container and take it with me to restaurants.
4485,4485,4485,4486,1,"This is the first time we bought this tea from Amazon, we used to get it directly from Revolution Tea. I don't know if that made any difference, or if it was just a change in the tea's composition (along with the packaging), but what used to be my wife's favorite tea now has a metallic smell and aftertaste, with much less of a pomegranate flavor and now a strong, almost cheap-generic-green-tea flavor. Really disappointing, especially since we're stuck with six boxes."
4486,4486,4486,4487,5,"As an ex-Brit. steeped (pun intended!) in strong black tea, I wasn't sure about this, but Revolution White Pomegranate tea is absolutely delicious, light yet flavorful.  The low caffeine content makes it ideal for an evening pot of tea and of course,iced tea. I hesitated to recommend it in case you run out of it!"
4487,4487,4487,4488,3,The flavor is very mild.  We tried brewing longer and using cooler water temp but the flavor is almost nonexistant.  Would not purchase again.
4488,4488,4488,4489,1,Trader Joe's Pomegranate White tea is superior to this tea. This is very bitter and perfumey. Maybe thats what you get when you brew whole leaves and stems . I found it repulsive.
4489,4489,4489,4490,5,"Revolution's teas are superb. Smooth and delicate, each one has been pleasant, comforting and a pure delight. I've tried this one, the pomegranate, as well as ginger peach, Dragon Eye Oolong, and white pear."
4490,4490,4490,4491,4,"I purchased this tea for someone who enjoys Trader Joe's white pomegranate tea, and unfortunately it was not a good substitute. Though I haven't tried it myself I was told it had a strong floral taste and aroma which to that particular tea drinker was undesirable.  I am rating 4 stars since this is such a subjective judgement, and I have no doubts about this being a high quality product."
4491,4491,4491,4492,5,"I've been using this tea for for about 6 months and drink it as iced tea daily.<br /><br />I microwave my water on high in a pyrex 2 cup glass container for 2 minutes on high and then pop the little white mesh bags in for about 5 - 15 minutes. I use about 3 - 4 bags for a rich taste and since I'm going to be pouring it over ice. I put my ice cubes in a large glass and pour my hot tea over the ice, grab a straw and it's ready to drink.<br /><br />It also tastes good when I steep 2 bags of the Revolution White Pomegranate Tea with 2 bags of the Arizona Pomegranate. This is my favorite on ice. The Arizona is a green tea. Anyhow, this is my usual lunchtime pick me upper. I want to note that I gave up drinking diet soda in March and has made this concoction my replacement. It was a little difficult at first, but now that awful stuff is out of my system.<br /><br />I have not tried this tea hot, as I am not a fan of hot tea, but I'm sure it's just as delicious. I subscribe to this and the Arizona Pomegranate Green Tea."
4492,4492,4492,4493,5,"This Melitta decaf Riviera Sunset coffee has an excellent taste.  There is none of the weird aftertaste you get with some other decaf coffees.  It's a smooth, mellow taste, even a little sweet and with a hint of cocoa.  I really enjoyed this.  The grind is listed as extra fine, but I didn't find it particularly fine myself.  When I grind my own beans, I have a finer grind than this, but I still expected a stronger taste from the Melitta than I would from other store brands.  However, the Melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store brands we have tried.  We like our coffee strong, about 1/2 cup ground coffee for 4 to 4 1/2 cups water (using measuring cups).  This ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the Melitta, but that is easily adjustable.  The nice thing about the coffee is that, even when I made it very strong, the smoothness remained.  I will definitely be trying other types of Melitta coffee in the future."
4493,4493,4493,4494,3,"I'm not a coffee expert, but I know a good tasting coffee when I drink a cup. The Melitta Riviera is a light roast, with a nutty and creamy flavor. The aroma is just exhilarating. It left a nice aroma throughout the house, almost made it seem like I was in a coffee shop. Unfortunately, it is just decaffeinated and did not give me the jolt I need in the morning.<br /><br />The packaging caused some problems for me. The seal is excessively tight. I've never had this problem with Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Peet's Coffee, or Meijer packs. With the Melitta, it was so tight that when I did open it, the bag tore apart and spilled a lot of the ground coffee onto my kitchen top and floor. One could argue that this tight seal packs in all the flavor, I could argue that if it were easier to open I wouldn't have spilled maybe 3 days worth of coffee grounds onto the floor.<br /><br />Pros: Light roast, excellent aroma, nutty and creamy taste<br /><br />Cons: Decaf (arggghhh) and hard to open pack<br /><br />Overall: 3/5"
4494,4494,4494,4495,5,"The minute you open a bag of Melitta Riviera Sunset you will think you are in Starbucks. The rich aroma is intoxicating, a promise of things to come. I like my coffee a little stronger so I used a ¼ cup ground coffee with 12-ounces water. After brewing the coffee my entire apartment was heavenly scented with a superior fragrance. The first sip was like falling in love. I literally felt heady. The only thing I added was a little half & half and two packets of stevia. I would highly recommend that you have this coffee after dinner with your dessert. This is truly an exceptional coffee! I'm beyond impressed. Now I'm eager to try the Melitta's Parisian Vanilla ground coffee.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
4495,4495,4495,4496,5,"Melitta's rich, flavourful product is a delicious treat comparable to coffees with a much higher price tag. It is a plus that the decaffeinated version does not sacrifice flavour. Highly recommended."
4496,4496,4496,4497,4,"This is pretty decent coffee, for pre-ground decaf.  Here's how a coffee snob reviews it:<br /><br />* Unpacking *<br />This coffee had to travel a long way to reach my house, and it was hot out.  Heat and time are enemies of fresh coffee.  The package was pretty hard to open, I resorted to scissors.  The grind is very uniform with no detectible dust.  The smell is stale compared to the local fresh roasted, non-decaf, beans I usually buy.<br /><br />* Brewing *<br />I busted out my cone and loaded two servings into a Melitta filter.  I poured two cups of 200F water through.  The uniform grind is apparent in that the coffee didn't clog as it does with blade-ground coffee (due to dust).  I drank the coffee black...<br /><br />* Tasting *<br />The smell is of decaf and or instant coffee.  Pretty stale but the decaf process is partly to blame.  Overall I enjoyed it as much as any drip decaf I've had recently.  There was no biting bitterness.  I drank two cups black without much of a gut ache.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Tight packaging with little air helps maintain freshness.<br />- Excellent grind uniformity.<br />- Low bitterness<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Not locally roasted.<br />- Not fresh. Best-by date is a year in advance.<br /><br />Verdict: For mail-order, pre-ground decaf, this coffee lived up to expectations and was drinkable.  3 or 4 stars."
4497,4497,4497,4498,5,I love coffee.  I love coffee a lot and really don't enjoy decaf.  This decaf isn't bitter though.  Tastes smooth and brews up very nicely.  Enjoyable to the last drop!
4498,4498,4498,4499,5,"This Melitta Cafe. Collection Riviera.Sunset blend coffee is so full flavored, it's much better than other decafs we have tried, and really tastes like regular coffee! Which is great because awe enjoy aided coffee Ian the Summer so no worries about it keeping us awake all night. Recommended!"
4499,4499,4499,4500,4,"This Melitta Riviera Sunset decaf makes a better-than-decent cup of coffee with medium body and just a little bite. I used my my usual two heaping coffee scoops for six ounces of water in a Bialetti stovetop espresso maker.<br /><br />While I was enjoying the coffee, I read the package and saw that it recommends two level teaspoons of coffee for six ounces of water. That got my curiosity up so I measured out my coffee scoop and it is one tablespoon. Since I use two heaping scoops, that's slightly more than three times as much as suggested on the package. Following the directions would probably make a watery, undrinkable brew.<br /><br />The coffee has a nice even espresso grind, perhaps a bit lighter than a French roast. I would have guessed that it was primarily arabica with some robusta but Melitta states that it is an all-arabica blend from Central and South America. It is decaffeinated through the chemical-free Swiss water process which is the only acceptable way to decaffeinate as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />Also note the cute vintage travel poster-style label and the clever name: because it's decaffeinated, it's perfect to drink while watching the sunset."
